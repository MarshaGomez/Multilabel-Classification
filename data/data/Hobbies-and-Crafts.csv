how to distinguish between a passion and a hobby,you may have lots of hobbies but you probably only have one or two passions the key difference is when you take something seriously and are always intense about it that s a sure sign it s a passion if you are pretty relaxed when you do the activity and you don t feel strongly about it it s more likely a hobby than a passion examine some of your hobbies to see how you really feel about them then try out a few ways to test the ones you think might truly be passions,pay attention to what occupies your mind most often when you are driving trying to fall asleep or exercising notice what you think about the most if you find yourself constantly thinking about an activity when you aren t doing it that may be a passion hobbies generally only occupy your mind when you are doing them or on occasion otherwise passions stick with you all day and you re always thinking about some aspect of them if you are always looking for garage sales and thrift shops checking your online seller accounts and trying to find buyers buying and selling used goods is a passion of yours evaluate how you spend your time pay attention to what you do during a given day or a whole week notice what you do most frequently or for the longest amount of time in each session the activities that you spend the most time on are likely to be passions rather than hobbies 1 x research source for example let s say in the course of a week you play guitar every day shoot baskets twice write bits of poetry four or five times and play xbox once guitar and poetry are top contenders to be passions while basketball and gaming are hobbies take notice of time seeming to pass quickly after you do an activity check whether you looked at the clock recently when you pursue a passion you don t notice that a lot of time goes by you re so engaged that time passes quickly if you check the time a lot it s probably a hobby for example a half hour of basketball is plenty but two hours of picking guitar strings passes like minutes because it s a passion notice when you blow off responsibilities for an activity look at your work and home responsibilities and see if anything consistently gets in the way of them if you tend to pursue a certain activity over other things that feel like work it s because you d rather do your passion say you are working on a research project instead of reading up on the topic you spend an hour taking the perfect picture for the presentation photography is your passion if your dirty dishes pile up for a week because you spend an hour practicing drums it s because you re passionate about playing ask yourself if the activity is relaxing or intense start doing the activity and after you ve been at it a while gauge how you feel if you re enjoying yourself and feel calm you are probably pursuing a hobby if you feel almost upset or at least a bit tense or focused you re working on a passion 2 x research source this may seem crazy but passions tend to cause you a bit of suffering you care a lot about it so pursuing a passion is not usually a calming experience hobbies are enjoyable and pleasant so you should feel pretty at peace when you re engaging in a hobby for example head out to your woodshop and start building something if you are in deep concentration and feeling on edge you re passionate about woodworking otherwise you d feel relaxed determine if you are trying to improve at the activity do the activity a little more frequently than you usually would pay attention to whether you are working hard to get better at it or if you are simply doing it for the enjoyment you get in the moment you work harder on passions than on hobbies 3 x research source you work to be the best at a passion but you are satisfied with having fun with a hobby for example if you are always cooking new recipes that challenge you it s a passion if you like to cook chili and cinnamon rolls repeatedly that s more of a hobby question if the activity is related to your values and beliefs make a list of values you have about life society or your faith or belief system then make a list of pursuits that you think might be passions if any of the activities line up with values you hold those are passions 4 x research source this takes some abstract thinking so give yourself time to look over the lists for example you might list hiking singing and gaming as hobbies you might list being adventurous staying healthy admiring beauty and unplugging from technology as values as you can see hiking aligns with those values so it s a passion tell someone about the potential passion and ask for their reaction pick something you think is a passion and talk to a friend about it when you re done talking ask them if you seemed intense or casual about it if you talk for a long time and they say you were intense about it that s a sign it s a passion 5 x research source when you are talking about your passion you will probably speak louder faster and more you ll get worked up talking about it you ll sound excited and won t want to stop talking if they say you didn t seem to know very much or you kept a pretty even tone it s a hobby you ll feel much more excitement talking about a passion than you will talking about a hobby take a break from the activity for a week choose something you do every week or every few days and stop doing it if you think about it daily miss it and don t feel like doing anything else you ve found something that s a passion if it doesn t bother you to stop doing it it s likely to be a hobby 6 x research source if you typically play ultimate frisbee every wednesday skip it this week if you fill the time with something else and barely think about it it s a hobby take a break from editing the film footage you are always shooting if after two days you can t think straight because you want to be at the computer you know it s a passion use a quiz as an objective guide get an opinion besides your own from a set of standardized questions be honest about your feelings on the activity you ll be able to learn how much it means to you from a set of questions and not just your own thoughts 7 x research source a quiz like this can t tell you without a doubt whether something is a passion or a hobby however it forces you to be more objective about the activity than you are on your own the websites of clarity on fire goodnet and paid to exist offer different types of quizzes that help you gain a better idea of what hobbies could be passions,Hobbies-and-Crafts

developed into a hobby think about the topics you go on endlessly about ask your friends and family what you seem to talk about the most now think about what it is about that subject that you enjoy so much and determine how it can be transformed into a hobby for instance maybe you are passionate about local politics and getting involved at a grassroots level could become your hobby think back to what you loved as a kid did you like to race bikes with your friends were you really into comic books did you love to paint or draw think about what really got you excited as a kid and what you could spend hours doing pick up where you left off if you rode bikes try getting a new adult bike and exploring your neighborhood take a class in what you loved if you loved drawing take a class at a local community college or art museum look at adult versions of what you loved that is if you loved comic books try attending a comic book convention comicon to find people with similar interests maybe you loved board games as a kid check out the wide variety of new board games on the market which offer options in everything from role playing to cooperative games visit a craft store wander around a craft store to see what hobbies are available you might find something you never thought about such as building model airplanes or learning how to work with clay visit a hardware store like craft

library will have how to books on a variety of topics browse through them to find topics that interest you which can turn into new hobbies budget your time your time is precious and you have a limited supply be sure to create space in your day for your new hobby by allocating a few minutes everyday for trying it out check out hobby websites certain websites are dedicated solely to exploring hobbies and you can use them to figure out what you d like to do with your time be willing to try more than one hobby the first one you try might not be the right fit don t be afraid to move on and try something else you have a right to decide when you re not interested in something 1 x research source say yes that is don t be afraid to say yes to activities you normally bow out of maybe going to the art museum doesn t sound very exciting to you but when your friend invites you to go give it a try anyway you might find a hobby you never expected to enjoy such as painting or art restoration redefine your definition of self one thing that may be holding you back from trying something new is you thinking i m not that kind of person maybe you think you re not brave enough or social enough for certain activities don t be afraid to step outside those boundaries for instance consider all those crazy hobbies that you ve dismissed because you thought you couldn t do them maybe you ve always wanted to learn the guitar or how to ballroom dance but didn t think you had the talent sign up for a class anyway maybe you have a knack for it and don t even know it tag along with a friend your friends already have similar interests and personalities that are compatible with yours so you might enjoy their hobbies as well ask them to show off their favorite hobbies and give you a taste for what they love to do for example maybe your best friends are really into swing dancing you can go with them to a lesson or you can ask for a basic lesson from them before getting your feet wet check out your local course catalog community colleges offer a wide range of courses for very little tuition read through one and you may find a class that sparks an interest you can request a catalog from most community colleges though the majority have catalogs online to peruse note where you spend your money take a month to note down where you spend all of your money you can use a smartphone app to help with this project or you can rely mostly on your bank account if you don t use much cash 2 x research source separate out what you spend into categories for instance you can have categories such as groceries gas clothing eating out entertainment rent bills and fees you could also separate your bills into two categories ones that are absolutely necessary such as insurance and ones that you may want to reduce or remove such as cable and your phone create a budget on a spreadsheet or app identify what percentage of your money is taken up by necessary items such as rent and bills also use your last month s spending to see how much you spend on gas and groceries determine how much you have leftover for discretionary spending 3 x research source decide how much of your budget you want to allocate to hobbies if you are starting a new hobby some money must come from other areas for instance you might want to cut down on other entertainment or stop eating out as much maybe you could spend less at the grocery store how much you allocate depends on what hobby you choose as some are more expensive than others pick a free or inexpensive hobby if you don t have much wiggle room in your budget you have a number of options available to you if you need a cheaper hobby for instance you could read or write take up running or try gardening or camping,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to transfer words to wood,there are lots of ways to create text on wood but if you want to be precise transferring it would be your best option once you create a template on the computer you can print it out then transfer it onto your piece of wood what type of paper you print it on depends on what sort of effect you want,create your text using a word or image editing program since you won t be reversing the text you can use whichever program you want create your text first then select it and change the font size and font type to whatever you want the color of the text does not matter you can even use an option that just gives you the outline you can also find pre made text online or even sketch your own on a sheet of printer paper print your text on a sheet of printer paper do not reverse or mirror the text just print it out on a piece of paper like you would any other document or homework assignment the type of printer does not matter here so you can use a laser or an inkjet printer 1 x research source make sure that you use printer paper you can even use binder paper in a pinch don t use cardstock however or it will be too thick for the transfer to work skip this step if you sketched your own text cover the back of the paper with graphite a thick graphite stick will get the job done a lot faster but you can use a pencil too be sure to press hard so that the graphite turns shiny you do not need to cover the entire paper just focus on the letters it would be best to cover the entire letter rather than just the outline 2 x research source you should be able to see the letters through the back of the paper if you can t you could place the paper against a bright window but this is not really necessary if the wood is dark colored the graphite won t show up use chalk instead you don t need a thick layer because it is so powdery 3 x research source tape the paper graphite side down on your piece of wood set the paper down so that the graphite is touching the wood and the letters are facing up move the paper around until you are happy with the position then tape down the corners 4 x research source it does not matter what type of tape you use as long as it holds the paper in place trace the letters with a pencil pressing hard as you trace the pressure will cause the graphite under the paper to stick to the wood wherever you press with the pencil the graphite will transfer 5 x research source lift the corner of the paper to check your progress the lines will be faint but you should still be able to see them you do not need to fill in the letters since you ll be painting them anyway remove the paper then go over the letters if needed the lines will be faint and ghostly which is fine if you are having troubles seeing the letters trace over them with a pen or pencil so that you can see them more clearly you ll be using these letters as stencils for the painting step 6 x research source if you are using a pen choose a color that matches the paint paint the letters with acrylic paint wide flat brushes are ideal for block letters while thin pointy brushes work better for cursive if you don t feel comfortable painting you can use paint pens instead 7 x research source if the wood is smooth you may be able to color the letters in with permanent markers instead the paint will cover the graphite chalk marks so don t worry let the paint dry this should only take about 15 to 20 minutes once the paint has dried you can display your wooden piece for a longer lasting finish coat it with a clear acrylic sealer acrylic sealer comes in matte glossy and satin finishes so choose wisely reverse your desired text using an image editing program open up an image editing program such as paint or photoshop use the text tool to type out your desired message use the editing tool to reverse or mirror the text 8 x research source it is important to reverse the text otherwise it will come out backwards choose a nice font and font size the text will come out lighter on the wood so dark bold or bright colors will look the best do not use white there is no such thing as white printer ink so it won t print if it doesn t print then it won t transfer secure a piece of wax paper to a sheet of printer paper coat the printer paper with a glue stick then press the wax paper on top trim off the excess wax paper then fold tape over the edges 9 x research source if you don t have wax paper use freezer paper instead make sure that the waxy side is facing up you don t have to tape every edge just the edge that will be going into the printer first print the text onto the wax paper using an inkjet printer be mindful of how you feed the paper into the printer the text must come out on the wax freezer paper once the text prints out handle the paper by the edges do not touch the ink or it will smear 10 x research source don t wait for the ink to dry it needs to be wet for the next step if you have a bottom loading printer insert the paper wax side down if you have a top loading printer insert the paper wax side up place the paper text side down onto the wood flip the paper over so that the wax paper is on the bottom position the paper over the wood then press it down once you are happy with the placement 11 x research source tape down the corners so that it doesn t slide around make sure that the wax paper printed text is touching the wood scrape the back of the paper with a credit card if you don t have a credit card you can use another thin plastic card such as a debit card or gift card press hard enough to burnish the text onto the wood but not so hard that the paper tears 12 x research source you may be able to use a spoon but the results may not be as vibrant 13 x research source remove the paper to reveal the text the text will have a faded vintage y look to it if you want something more vibrant paint over the text using acrylic paint for a longer lasting finish coat your wood with a clear acrylic sealer you can apply the sealer directly over the printed text without using paint acrylic sealer comes in matte satin and glossy finishes so choose one that you like the best reverse your text in an image editing program open up an image editing program then create your desired text set the font size color and type to whatever you want then reverse the image so that the letters are backwards this is important if you don t reverse the text it will come out backwards when you transfer it to the wood print the text on transfer paper using a laser printer you can buy transfer paper from the t shirt and fabric paint section of a craft store or a fabric store you may also be able to order it online make sure that you print on the textured side of the paper not the papery side 14 x research source if you only have an inkjet printer you may be able to find transfer paper made specifically for inkjet printers read the labels choose paper made for light colored fabrics if you get the kind made for dark colored fabrics your text will have a white background place the paper face down on your piece of wood make sure that the printed text is face down and touching the wood if you want to you can secure the edges of the paper to the wood with pieces of tape 15 x research source iron the paper using a hot no steam setting turn on your iron to the cotton or linen setting and wait for it to heat up make sure that the steam setting is turned off then iron the paper just like you would a shirt 16 x research source press and hold and hold the iron firmly against the paper if you don t apply enough pressure the text won t transfer properly how long you do this for depends on the brand of paper that you are using most brands will require about 5 to 10 seconds however peel the paper away to reveal your text the transfer paper will have acted just like it would on fabric or close to it the text may have come out light but this is due to the rough porous texture of the wood 17 x research source if the text did not come out dark enough you can paint over it with acrylic paints coat your wood with a clear acrylic sealer in a matte glossy or satin finish to protect the transferred text,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to use life hacks,life hacks are quick relatively easy and usually fun things that save a bit of time or make your life a little easier try some simple hacks when you re cooking cleaning taking care of the kids or even just relaxing on the beach you can find endless lists of life hacks online but always use your best judgment as to whether a hack is both useful and safe,lay a wooden spoon over the top of a pot to prevent a boil over the foaming bubbles created by boiling water are filled with steam if they touch something at a temperature below 100 c 212 f the steam will condense change back into a liquid and break the surface tension of the bubbles 1 x research source a wooden spoon is the best choice because a plastic spoon might melt and a metal spoon will get very hot to the touch make ramen noodles in a coffee maker for a quick meal put the noodles in the carafe and add the recommended amount of water to the reservoir turn on the brewing cycle and leave the noodles in the dispensed hot water for the recommended time transfer them to a bowl and stir in the seasonings 2 x research source you can add the seasonings to the carafe as well but this makes it hard to get the flavor of ramen noodle seasoning out of your coffee pot make there isn t a used coffee filter in the machine before proceeding you don t need to add a clean filter reheat leftover pizza in a skillet to get a crispy crust place the skillet over medium heat and add a quick spritz of cooking spray or a few drops of cooking oil heat a slice of pizza in the pan for 2 minutes then put the lid on and turn the heat to low for about 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted 3 x research source add a few drops of water to the pan before putting on the lid to cook the top of the pizza a bit faster be careful though as any oil in the pan may splatter use a skirt hanger with clips as a space saving cookbook holder use the 2 clips on the hanger to hold the cookbook open put the hanger s hook over a nearby cupboard handle to create an instant and very useful cookbook holder 4 x research source the open book will be at just the right height for easy reference and it won t take up valuable counter space remove stems from strawberries quickly with a thick straw insert the straw into the side opposite to the stem and press it up through the center of the strawberry when you get all the way through to the top the stem will pop right up and out 5 x research source a sturdy plastic straw works well but a reusable metal straw is even better in either case use a wider milkshake or smoothie straw if available use tongs to more easily squeeze all the juice from a lemon cut a lemon in half then wedge one half between the tongs cut side facing out squeeze the ends of the tongs that you usually use for picking up things to press out as much lemon juice as possible repeat with the other half 6 x research source consider laying a fine mesh strainer over the bowl or pitcher you re squeezing the juice into in order to catch the seeds use your cereal spoon to keep milk from splashing when you pour it add your cereal to the bowl then lay your spoon upside down on top of it pour the milk slowly onto the underside of the spoon s head you ll notice far less splashing than when you pour the milk directly onto the cereal 7 x research source alternatively add the milk to the bowl first then the cereal remove the yolk from a cracked egg easily with a water bottle crack the egg into a bowl or dish then grab a clean empty plastic water bottle squeeze the bottle about halfway not enough to crush it place it right on top of the yolk and release your squeeze the yolk will be sucked up into the bottle 8 x research source pit cherries quickly with a straw and a bottle choose an empty glass or plastic bottle with a mouth that s smaller than your cherries so that you can place a cherry stem side up on the bottle opening press straight down through the stem with a sturdy straw metal is best a skewer or a chopstick the pit will drop right into the bottle 9 x research source chill a beverage quickly in the freezer with wet paper towels wet down 1 2 paper towel sheets then squeeze out the excess water wrap the paper towels around a can or bottled drink and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes the damp paper towels help chill the drink much more quickly 10 x research source don t forget about a glass bottle you put in the freezer if the liquid freezes the bottle may explode store mixed pancake batter conveniently in a plastic ketchup bottle this is a great way to store extra batter in the fridge for up to 3 days and it makes dispensing the batter easy just squeeze out the amount you need right onto the griddle when making pancakes 11 x research source use a kitchen funnel to make it easier to pour the batter into the bottle or find a plastic bottle with a slightly smaller mouth than the ketchup bottle cut off the bottom of this second bottle place it upside down into the mouth of the ketchup bottle and use it as a diy funnel use a muffin tin to serve a range of condiments at a party add ketchup mustard barbecue sauce salsa mayonnaise or whatever other condiments you need to the individual indentations in the muffin tin this makes serving the condiments and cleaning up afterward a cinch 12 x research source cut clean slices of cheesecake and soft desserts with dental floss cut a length of unflavored dental floss and wrap the ends around your index fingers pull it taut and press it straight down through cheesecake cinnamon rolls fondant jelly rolls and so on 13 x research source use the same process to cut through clay with a length of wire keep your packaged bread fresher longer with a plastic bottle top starting at the point where the cylinder starts to narrow toward the spout cut the top section off of a clean dry plastic drink bottle feed the open end of the bread bag up through the cut opening and out of the mouth of the bottle then fold it down over the sides of the mouth screw on the bottle s lid to make an airtight seal 14 x research source use plastic lids as simple but effective coasters don t have a coaster on hand a plastic lid from a mayonnaise jar or similar container can do the job just place your drink on top and you ve got a neat coaster make canvas shoes water resistant by applying beeswax use a clean rag to spread the beeswax over the entire outer surface of the shoes making sure not to miss any areas then wave a hairdryer over the shoes until the wax melts and becomes invisible apply another coat of beeswax whenever you notice the water resistant coating begin to falter 15 x research source iron a dress shirt collar fast with a hair straightener iron this is a quick fix that saves time versus getting out your iron and board just plug in the hair straightener let it heat up and clamp it over each side of your shirt collar for about 15 seconds to play it safe don t do this while you re wearing the shirt 16 x research source this is a great hack if you re going to wear a sweater over your dress shirt anyway why bother ironing the whole thing use white wine to reduce the appearance of a red wine stain if you splash some red wine on your white shirt grab some white wine dampen a clean cloth in white wine and gently blot the red wine stain until it becomes less noticeable it won t remove the stain completely but it does a surprisingly good job 17 x research source if you have a stain remover stick or wipes with you use them they work even better if you left them at home use them on the stain before washing the garment prevent lost socks by pinning pairs before washing and drying stop feeding single socks to the dryer monster by outwitting it simply secure each pair of socks together with a safety pin before putting them into the wash keep them pinned together when you transfer them to the dryer 18 x research source replace any pins that start to show signs of rusting screw a magazine holder onto the back of a cabinet door to hold a hairdryer choose a magazine file holder made of plastic wood metal wire or sturdy cardboard and secure it in place with 2 4 screws most standard hairdryers fit perfectly into this spot 19 x research source alternatively use several removable adhesive strips instead of screws use coat hooks instead of rods to hang towels in a small bathroom these take up much less space since each hook can hold 2 large towels the towels may also dry faster than if you use towel rods that are stacked one in front of the next apply magnetic strips behind cabinet doors to store personal care items buy peel and stick magnetic strips or use removable adhesive strips to secure the magnets in place use the magnetic strips to hold tweezers bobby pins cosmetic brushes and other magnetic objects 20 x research source check to see how many of your personal care items are magnetic before trying this buy a scrub brush attachment for your drill to clean tile and ceramic instead of relying on elbow grease alone to scrub a tub or toilet let your drill do the hard work look for different types of scrub brush attachments where cleaning supplies are sold set the drill to its lowest speed first then increase it as needed follow the brush attachment s instructions carefully don t use the attachment to clean fiberglass laminate wood stone or other surfaces unless the brush is specifically marketed for that purpose use a clean dustpan to fill a bucket that won t fit under the sink place the bucket on the floor directly in front of the sink place the larger end of the dustpan under the faucet so that the pan s handle is resting over the front edge of the sink when you turn on the water it will flow through the channel in the handle go over the edge and fall like a waterfall into the bucket 21 x research source have some towels handy the first few times you try this it may take a bit of practice to get the placement and water flow just right paint your keys with nail polish to color code them this is a great hack if you have a bunch of similar looking keys on your key ring gel nail polish adheres best to metal keys but any type of polish will do 22 x research source store your household cleaners conveniently in a shoe hanger hang or attach the shoe hanger to the back of a closet or pantry door then fill the pockets with your cleaning bottles choose a shoe hanger with mesh or clear plastic pockets so you can easily differentiate the cleaning bottles 23 x research source if you have a hanging rod in the closet get a shoe hanger with hooks for safety add a lock to the door if there are kids around try different home remedies to remove permanent marker different diy removers may work better for different materials give the following a try for fabric try hand sanitizer for your skin or for wood surfaces try rubbing alcohol for painted walls try hairspray or toothpaste for ceramic or glass mix 1 part white toothpaste and 1 part baking soda soak a crusty paintbrush in vinegar for 30 minutes to ease cleaning after 30 minutes use a wire brush or paintbrush cleaner to remove the loosened paint then wash the brush with soap and water rinse it and let it air dry 24 x research source if you heat the vinegar to nearly boiling in a pot on the stove you can reduce the soaking time to 10 minutes reduce the odor of water based paint with vanilla extract when painting a room stir in 1 us tbsp 15 ml of vanilla extract per 1 us gal 3 8 l of paint the vanilla will mask the unpleasant odor of the paint essential oils like peppermint work as well 25 x research source this hack doesn t work on oil based paint since the vanilla extract or other essential oil creates a solution with the oils in the paint which may negate the pleasant scent you re aiming for or make the paint smell even worse the oils aren t soluble with water based paint though so they remain separate and help mask the paint odor use a rubber band to keep kids from locking a door loop the rubber band over one door knob make a figure eight over the latch then loop the free end of the rubber band over the other door knob choose a thick sturdy rubber band that is stretched taut when positioned this way 26 x research source make a smaller laundry basket play tub within your bathtub place a standard rectangular laundry basket into the tub as you fill it with water put your toddler or small child into the basket along with their toys when bathtime is done just drain the tub and lift out the basket with all the toys inside 27 x research source this is not a substitute for an infant bath basin use it only for kids who are big enough to bathe in a standard tub supervise children at all times while bathing create a child safety bead bracelet with your phone number on it buy a container of colorful bracelet beads and let your child help you thread them onto the bracelet string pick out numbered beads and string them on so that they correspond to your phone number 28 x research source you might also want to spell out the child s first name a bracelet is no substitute for proper supervision of a child use pool noodles to help keep a kid from rolling out of bed lay a foam pool noodle along each long edge of the bed right on top of the mattress tuck the fitted sheet over the mattress so that the noodles are held securely in place the small humps created by the noodles will make it less likely that your child will roll off the edge of the bed 29 x research source use this as a short term measure for an occasional problem invest in proper bed rails if your child rolls out of bed frequently trace a kid s feet on paper when you re shoe shopping without them instead of having to guess whether a pair of shoes will fit bring their feet or at least a tracing of them with you trace around both their feet either barefoot or with socks on if the shoes you re looking at are larger but not too much larger than the traced outlines the shoes will fit at least for a few months 30 x research source use paper cupcake or muffin wrappers to catch drips from frozen treats poke the bottom of the wooden stick of your kid s favorite frozen treat like a popsicle or ice cream bar through the bottom of the paper wrapper slide the wrapper up to the base of the treat and let it catch all the inevitable drips 31 x research source paper wrappers with foil on the outside work best but any paper wrapper will do seal your tablet in a zip close bag if you like to read in the tub use a clear 1 us gal 3 8 l bag with a secure zip closure test the bag first by sealing a piece of paper inside and submerging it for 1 minute if the paper is dry your tablet should stay dry too 32 x research source play it safe and do your best to keep your tablet dry regardless don t try to read underwater use springs from used pens to strengthen the ends of charger cables charger cables tend to kink bend and break right near the ends where they plug into the wall or your device to protect these sensitive areas pull apart several old dried up pens and pick out the springs inside wrap the springs around the ends of the cables to give them more protection while still letting them flex somewhat 33 x research source organize cords at the edge of your desk with binder clips this is a great hack if your desk is cluttered with several charger cables printer cables ethernet cables and so on choose binder clips that are large enough to clip to the edge of the desk but also small enough if possible to keep the head of each cable from falling through the binder clip opening 34 x research source if you can t fit the head of a cord through the binder clip wires squeeze the sides of each wire to remove them from the clip then squeeze them again to put them back in place after you ve pulled the head of the cord through organize cords using empty toilet paper tubes in a shoebox for a smaller cord stand a toilet paper tube up in the box and feed the cord down into the tube for a larger cord use the toilet paper tube as a sleeve and slide it over the cord once you ve looped it around itself several times 35 x research source stand your phone upright in a cup glass or mug to amplify the volume if you tend to sleep through your alarm even when it s set to high volume give this hack a try put the phone s speaker which is usually at the bottom into the bottom of the cup and get ready for a much louder sound 36 x research source you can use this trick to amplify music but it may take some trial and error to find a cup glass or mug that doesn t distort the sound of your favorite tunes use a cassette tape case as a cheap but sturdy phone stand try this hack if you find some old cassette tapes with their cases in the attic open the case s lid as far as it will go then lay the case front side down on your table or desk the slot in the lid will hold your phone at a great viewing angle 37 x research source some larger smartphones may not fit into the slot carry multiple plastic bags at once with a large carabiner clip the problem with carrying several plastic

how to make papyrus,long before paper came into existence the egyptians devised a way to create a sort of early version of paper called papyrus in fact our word for paper actually comes from papyrus even with the onset of the digital age the societies of our world still operate largely on paper and ink although paper can be easily bought making papyrus is a useful skill and it feels great to create your own paper to make papyrus prepare the plant make the papyrus and finish up the process properly for the nicest result possible 1 x research source,obtain a papyrus plant papyrus paper is created from the cyperus papyrus plant which is a light but strong reed you can buy them online or in nurseries a nursery that specializes in papyrus would be your best bet however 2 x research source you can also make the paper out of wide grasses like river reeds choose a papyrus plant with a strong healthy stalk as this is what you ll turn into paper cut the stalks about 12 inches 30 cm of papyrus plant will make a large piece of paper that will be nearly 24 inches 61 cm in length cut off as many stalks as you will need to make the amount of paper you want the cuts must be diagonally made then cut the tips of the papyrus you will not use the tips which are the thinner grass like end of the plant 3 x research source use strong scissors or pruners peel away the outer layer of the papyrus plant only the inner part of the plant is used for the paper you will need to remove the outer green part of the plant use a sharp knife and slice down the length of the plant until the entire outer layer is removed the inside of the plant should be a white or slightly greenish color 4 x research source you can also use scissors if you don t have a sharp knife available have someone help you with the peeling process if you are uncomfortable with using a sharp knife for slicing cut up the inner portion into strips use the knife you used to cut off the outer portion to cut the inner layers of the papyrus plant pith into thin strips hold the plant in your hand and cut towards you vertically make sure that all of the strips have the same size and thickness 5 x research source the best strips typically come from the center of the plant the lowest quality comes from the outermost layers it is also an option to cut away from your body if you don t feel comfortable cutting towards your body you can cut the strips into smaller pieces if you want to make smaller sized paper place the papyrus plant strips in water there are some natural glue like chemicals within the plant that need to be released before you can turn it into papyrus let them soak in the water for at least 3 days try to lay them out flat in a tray of water to soak set the tray in a place where the water won t evaporate quickly 6 x research source the strips should turn flexible and transparent lay the papyrus plant strips on a hard flat surface the pattern doesn t matter at this point as you will be rearranging them later just lay them out on a hard flat surface and make sure they don t overlap 7 x research source a smooth non tiled countertop or a sturdy table will work roll the excess water and sugar out of the plant grab a rolling pin and use it to roll the strips flat the rolling pin should be squeezing the water out of them and flattening the strips into sheets 8 x research source in the past papyrus strips were pounded with a hard object to remove the excess water weave the strips together lay the strips on the cloth get a dry sheet of linen cloth or felt then begin to weave them together you want to create 2 layers of strips with the top layer strips being perpendicular to the bottom layer strips it should resemble a placemat the strips should slightly overlap one another to prevent the papyrus from falling apart later 9 x research source cover the papyrus strips with a second sheet of linen cloth once you have weaved them together place the bundle between 2 wooden boards make sure that the wooden boards are somewhat heavy the pressure is necessary to flatten the papyrus strips together once the strips have been placed between the boards press them together lay the sandwiched papyrus sheet on a flat surface and allow the wooden boards to flatten the sheet using gravity 10 x research source you can put heavy books on top of the boards if the boards aren t very heavy replace the wet linen sheets with dry ones you should do this every few hours be careful when removing the wet linen peel it off of the papyrus gently the drying process should take approximately 72 hours 11 x research source flatten the sheet the paper may not be completely flat after you remove it from the wooden boards put the paper under a stone slab for up to 6 days to make it completely flat 12 x research source during this time the sugars within the papyrus will fuse together if you are pressed for time you can use the rolling pin to flatten the paper polish the papyrus this step isn t absolutely necessary but it will make the papyrus look nicer and more finished use a shell or smooth piece of ivory any type of shell that is smooth and without ridges will do rub the shell or ivory over the sheet of paper until it appears to be shinier than it was 13 x research source a smooth stone will work as well do not rub with too much force or you could rip the paper cut the paper the sheet may be larger than you want when it is finished use a razor scissors or paper cutter to cut the papyrus into smaller sheets measure the sizes you are cutting so you will have multiple sheets of the same size you can make a notebook out of the sheets of paper you ve just made cover the table surface with newspaper and paper towels use newspaper to cover the table or whatever surface you re planning to make the paper on the process can get messy especially with children this will make cleaning up easier once the surface is covered place a paper towel on top of the newspaper 14 x research source the paper towel will be the base layer of the papyrus mix glue and water into a bowl use ½ cup 120 ml of glue any type of liquid white glue will work then pour ½ cup 120 ml of water in the bowl mix the contents with a spoon until a runny consistency is created 15 x research source pour 1 cup 240 ml each glue and water if you plan on making 2 sheets of paper tear paper bags into strips you will need to use 2 brown paper lunch bags tear the bags into 1 2 in 1 3 cm wide strips but the strips should be long tear the strips as long as you want the paper to be you can use your hands to tear the strips or cut them with scissors 16 x research source you should use 4 brown paper bags if you plan to make 2 sheets of paper tearing the strips is better than cutting them because the ripped edges will fuse together better and give you a smoother surface dip the strips into the glue and water mixture dip each strip individually try to keep the strips as flat as possible when dipping them make sure the strips are fully soaked with the mixture 17 x research source run the strips between your index and middle fingers to remove any excess glue like with papier mâché you want the strips to be saturated but not dripping lay the strips out vertically after you dip each strip in the mixture lay them next to each other on top of the paper towel you should lay them out vertically the strips should be slightly overlapping 18 x research source make sure that the top and bottom edges are aligned you don t want them to be off set or crooked lay the second half of the strips out once the first half off the strips have been laid out vertically begin laying out the second half of the strips lay the strips out horizontally and on top of the vertical ones 19 x research source for a more authentic look you can weave the horizontal strips over and under the vertical ones just like making a basket or woven rug smooth out the paper press the paper with your hands once all of the strips have been laid out smooth out any excess air or glue bubbles continue doing this until the paper is smooth and flat 20 x research source start in the middle of the paper and work your way outward towards the edges move your hands apart horizontally first then vertically allow the paper to dry keep the paper on top of the paper towel and newspaper while it dries it should take about 8 hours to dry once it has dried carefully peel the paper off of the newspaper 21 x research source the paper towel will likely be stuck to the back of your papyrus which is fine it is in the back if you are pressed for time you can speed the process up with a hairdryer,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to keep deco mesh from fraying,deco mesh is a loosely woven material commonly used to make wreaths it comes in all sorts of colors and widths and it even has wires in the sides to help to hold its shapes unfortunately deco mesh frays easily luckily there are a few things that you can do to help minimize or eliminate fraying,purchase a soldering iron with a wide tip a regular soldering iron with a pointed tip will still work but something with a flat wide tip like a flat head screwdriver will get the job done faster 1 x research source you may be able to rent a soldering iron from a hardware store a wood burning tool will also work just fine for this choose one with a wide flat tip turn the soldering iron on how you do this and how long it takes for it to heat up depends on what you have some soldering irons plug into the wall while others are battery operated most soldering irons only need a few minutes to heat up work on the next step while the soldering iron heats up to save time set your deco mesh on a hard heat safe surface do not cut the mesh with scissors simply measure out how much you want to cut then set it down on a hard heat safe surface if you need to draw a cutting guideline with a marker across the mesh you don t want to cut the mesh because it will fray the surface must be hard otherwise the soldering iron won t cut through the mesh it must be heat safe too otherwise you ll create a fire hazard press the tip of the soldering iron against the deco mesh the wider edge of the iron s tip should be parallel to the end of the mesh this way you ll have more surface area to cut with hold it there for a few seconds until it melts through the fibers 2 x research source deco mesh is composed of lengthwise and widthwise fibers place the tip between 2 widthwise fibers gently rock the iron back and forth to help it cut through the mesh start on the edge of the deco mesh it does not matter if it s on the left or right side work your way across the deco mesh lift the soldering iron and move it across the mesh to the next un cut segment press it down again and rock it back and forth until it cuts through the mesh keep doing this until you reach the other side of the mesh 3 x research source the heat of the iron will cause the fibers to melt and separate the hot plastic will bind to itself and prevent fraying cut the deco mesh 1 inch 2 5 cm longer than you want it this extra length will be enough to create a 1 2 in 1 3 cm hem at each end it would be an even better idea to cut the mesh a little longer than that just in case it starts to fray as you work 4 x research source instead of scissors consider using a rotary cutter this will help reduce fraying even more fold the end down by 1 2 inch 1 3 cm if the mesh is wired then pinch the edges to help create a crease pinch your way across the folded edge or weigh the mesh down with a heavy book 5 x research source just do one end for right now open up the hem and coat it with glue you can use hot glue or fabric glue for this hot glue will dry faster but it will also turn opaque and stiff fabric glue will need longer to dry but it will dry clear and not as stiff 6 x research source use a low temp hot glue gun this way you can handle it with your fingers without getting blisters work on a sheet of wax paper or freezer paper so that the glue doesn t sink through the mesh and stick to your table cover the hem with wax paper and press it down the wax paper will help keep your fingers clean since you won t be touching the glue directly if you used hot glue then it will act as a buffer between your skin and the hot glue if you don t have wax paper you can use freezer paper instead peel the paper away and let the glue dry if you used hot glue this should only take 2 to 3 minutes you ll know it is dry once it turns opaque again the same color as the glue stick if you used fabric glue then you may have to wait 15 to 20 minutes hem and glue the other end of the deco mesh set the mesh down on a sheet of wax paper and fold the end down by 1 2 inch 1 3 cm coat the inside of the hem with hot glue or fabric glue then fold it back down cover it with another sheet of wax paper and press it with your finger remove the paper when you re done after this the mesh is ready to use use a rotary cutter instead of scissors to minimize fraying this won t completely eliminate fraying but it will help reduce it it is a great option if you don t have the time to glue the mesh make sure that you cut across the mesh between 2 widthwise fibers cut the mesh then place drops of glue on the corners for a quick solution cut across the mesh between 2 widthwise fibers place a drop of glue on each corner of the mesh then wait for the glue to set this will help keep that last widthwise strand in place trim the excess lengthwise fibers down if desired 7 x research source hot glue will work just fine here but you can also use fabric glue or super glue hot glue will set within minutes while fabric glue and super glue will need 10 to 15 minutes to set spray the edge with hairspray spray adhesive or clear acrylic sealer cut your deco mesh to the length you want it between 2 widthwise fibers set it down on a sheet of paper then mist it with your desired product wait for it to dry then flip it over and spray the other side let it dry completely before using it 8 x research source how long the deco mesh takes to dry depends on the product that you used hairspray will dry the fastest you don t need to spray the entire deco mesh just the edge knot the end of the mesh if it won t be visible this is a great option if you are making a deco mesh wreath where the ends are behind the wire frame and out of sight form a loop in the deco mesh then pull the end through it guide the knot towards the end of the mesh then trim off the excess 9 x research source keep the ends of your mesh on the back of the wreath so that they aren t visible,Hobbies-and-Crafts

already good at may result in you feeling stressed and quitting think about what skills you already have if you re looking for something low key for example maybe you already enjoy cooking for yourself each night you re not terribly skilled but you re a decent cook and have always been up for new recipes you could take a cooking class as you already know the foundations of cooking it ll be easier to get into the swing of things with this new hobby consider whether you want a challenge some people get bored developing established skills if you re the type of person who craves a challenge you may want to find a hobby that pushes you out of your comfort zone a little for example maybe you re slightly sedentary by nature and are a bit resistant to going out you could try running or hiking both of which force you to get out and move make a list of things you already like it s important to choose a hobby that reflects your personal interests you re vastly more likely to stick to a

completely dried most stain blockers take between 6 and 8 hours to dry 8 x research source stain blocker is available at your local hardware store sketch out the size and spacing for your lettering you may want to use a ruler to calculate exactly where you want each letter to be and what size to make your writing sketch out how much space the writing will take up on the wood by making a box or boxes to fit your letters into the box es will form a guideline to help you center your template and keep your letters organized 9 x research source alternatively make a frame to block your letters into with masking tape 10 x research source center the template on top of the wood retrieve the template you ve made or printed out and lay it on top of the wood line up your template within the guidelines you ve drawn add tape to the corners of your template to keep it in position as you draw 11 x research source trace the outlines of each word on the template with a pencil press the tip of your pencil into the paper and trace over the lines of your template focus only on the outlines of each letter apply strong pressure so the strokes show up on the wood use a pencil so that you ll be able to correct any mistakes 12 x research source take the template off of the wood to check the visibility of your outlines if your outlining was successful you ll notice strokes left behind by the pencil if you can t make out the lines place the template over the wood and outline the letters again you can erase any mistakes you ve made with a pencil eraser 13 x research source write each letter carefully with a permanent marker or paint pen mistakes made with permanent markers or paint markers cannot be erased pay attention to the lines as you trace over them focus on drawing the correct positioning and shapes of each letter 14 x research source embellish your letters with different stroke widths and curly designs focus on making them look appealing once the letters have been outlined

how to make beeswax wraps,beeswax wraps are a great sustainable alternative to plastic food coverings to make beeswax wraps start by cutting cotton fabric to your preferred size and grating a block of beeswax into small pieces then sprinkle the beeswax over the fabric and place it into the oven until the beeswax melts spread the beeswax out using a paintbrush and then once the wrap dries it is ready to use,get 100 cotton fabric for a zero waste option use clean old sheets or pillowcases or go thrift shopping to find fabric with bright patterns alternatively purchase new cotton fabric either from a craft store or online 1 x research source the amount of fabric that you will need depends on how many beeswax wraps you want to make for example 1 yd 0 9 m of fabric will be enough to make approximately 3 12 in 12 in 30 cm 30 cm beeswax wraps check that the width of the fabric is at least 1 yd 0 9 m beeswax wraps require cotton as when cotton is combined with beeswax it becomes unbreathable this is what makes beeswax wraps ideal for storing food preheat the oven to 185 f 85 c turn the oven on and set it to the conventional bake setting let the oven preheat as you prepare the materials to make the beeswax wraps 2 x research source if the oven temperature is any higher the beeswax may burn the symbol for the conventional bake setting is 2 lines with 1 at the top and the other at the bottom of the square however other ovens simply have a setting with the label bake measure the fabric to your preferred size use a ruler to measure out either a 12 in 12 in 30 cm 30 cm or an 8 in 20 cm square use chalk to mark out the fabric 3 x research source beeswax wraps come in a variety of different sizes depending on the type of food that you plan to use them for a 12 in 12 in 30 cm 30 cm beeswax wrap is an ideal size to use for covering a bowl while a smaller 8 in 8 in 20 cm 20 cm wrap is best for sandwiches fruit and vegetables cut out the fabric with pinking shears create squares of fabric in your preferred size you can choose to start with just 1 wrap or cut out many squares if you want to make multiple wraps at a time 4 x research source pinking shears will prevent the cut edges of the fabric from fraying grate a packed beeswax block into small pieces use a cheese grater to finely grate up the beeswax you will need around 0 5 ounces 14 g per 8 by 8 inches 200 mm 200 mm wrap that you intend to make 5 x research source you can purchase blocks of beeswax from local beekeepers at craft stores or online make sure that it is high quality food grade beeswax ask the maker for more information about what the beeswax is suitable for if you are unsure 6 x research source if you are making 12 in 12 in 30 cm 30 cm beeswax wraps you will need approximately 0 8 ounces 23 g of grated beeswax per wrap sprinkle the beeswax over the fabric place the fabric on an old baking sheet that is covered with parchment paper then evenly spread the grated beeswax out over the full surface of the fabric 7 x research source make sure that you use an old baking sheet as the beeswax will stick to it and will be very difficult to remove if you are wanting to make more than 1 wrap make each wrap individually place the fabric and beeswax into the oven for approximately 5 minutes slide the old baking sheet with the fabric topped with beeswax into the oven remove the baking sheet from the oven as soon as the beeswax has melted 8 x research source keep a close eye on the wrap while it s in the oven as if it is left in there for too long it may burn the fabric will look wet when the beeswax has melted spread the beeswax out evenly over the fabric using a paintbrush make sure that the whole piece of fabric is covered in wax check that the whole piece of fabric looks wet including the corners as this means that the melted beeswax is in all of the right spots 9 x research source make sure that the paintbrush you use is clean is new and hasn t been around any toxic substances such as paint 10 x research source if the wax begins to harden before you have had time to spread it out properly simply place it back into the oven until it melts again hang the wrap up on a clothesline to dry once the beeswax is covering the full piece of fabric hang it up with clothes pegs on a clothesline to dry if you don t have a clothesline create a makeshift line by hanging a piece of rope or string across a doorway the drying process won t take longer than 15 minutes 11 x research source you will be able to tell when the wrap is ready to use as it will have cooled and it will feel stiff wipe away any beeswax residue that you see in the wraps with a damp cloth before you use them 12 x research source use the beeswax wrap to mold around food items to cover bowls simply lay the wrap flat over the bowl and fold it in at the rim for items of food place the item in the center of the wrap and fold it around the shape the warmth of your hands will mold the wrap around the shape 13 x research source use the beeswax wraps for dry foods such as whole fruits and vegetables nuts and sandwiches foods that contain a lot of moisture such as sliced fruit with a lot of juice or leftover meals won t store well in beeswax wraps and should be kept in a container instead,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to encourage a teenager to take up a hobby,having a hobby can greatly enrich a teenager s life hobbies can increase physical activity and social interaction provide stress relief teach valuable skills and of course be a source of fun however many teens are unwilling to try a hobby you may be overlooking some things that are great hobbies already and you just need to recognize and nurture that interest for your teen use some insight and gentle guidance to help your teen to explore their interests and find their perfect hobby,ask your teen what makes them feel good about themselves one way to help a teenager find a hobby is to focus on their strengths and what makes them feel good many teens may only focus on weakness or things they have failed at instead emphasize anything that they enjoy doing or that makes them happy 1 x research source for example your teen may be interested in music sports computers crafting role playing games or science a person doesn t have to be good at a hobby to enjoy it hobbies aren t necessarily talents if your teen loves to play an instrument or a sport but is just mediocre that s okay as long as they feel good while doing it it can turn into a hobby ask your teen what they want to do maybe your teen has been wanting to try something for a long time but has been unsure if you would agree to it however you might just get a shrug in response that is normal asking what do you want to do is a pretty vague and broad question tell your teen to think about it and then ask them about it later 2 x research source try asking what would you like to do today or what do you want to do this weekend you might also try saying let s do something you are interested in today what would you like to do if your kid wants to cook often or likes to be outside you may be close to figuring out a good hobby for them determine if your teen already participates in hobbies teenagers spend much of their life away from the eyes of parents and don t always offer up information as a result sometimes adults are not entirely aware that adolescents are developing hobbies your child may be developing hobbies away from home so you may not have to encourage them to adopt new ones instead you can support their current hobbies 3 x research source ask your teen what they do to relax and unwind besides electronic devices video games and the like they may be listening to music sketching making a photo project or creating a blog and you may not fully realize it realize that not all hobbies are big projects flashy or occupy a lot of time the teen that collects heart shaped rocks may have a different type of hobby than one that makes her own youtube videos but they are both hobbies brainstorm ideas with your teen teens need time to think about what their passions and interests are especially if they don t already know support them as they try to figure out what enjoy and try new things you may even brainstorm with them list all ideas even if they sound stupid or impossible at first sometimes a flippant remark ends up being a brilliant idea 4 x research source good ideas for hobbies include fencing reading or drawing manga creating movies or music cooking playing an instrument participating in quiz bowl playing board or rpg games or crafting have the teen make an interest list after brainstorming have your teen write down a list of interests they would like to pursue or be curious about then have the teen rank the interests on a scale from 1 to 10 with one being most likely to try and 10 being least likely 5 x research source for example your teen might list cooking basketball board games video games reading and hiking after they make the list have them put them in order based on which ones they want to do the most this list can help your teen start figuring out what they are more interested in so they can try the activity if they don t like the activity they can move on to the next activity on the list analyze the teen s personality a person s personality can help them figure out hobbies or interests think about your teen what are their character traits what things do they get in trouble for doing what do they gravitate towards the answers to these questions can help them come up with ideas 6 x research source for example if your teen is chatty they may enjoy something like debate volunteer work or drama if your teen would rather be outside than doing homework they may be interested in nature or sports search for opportunities you think your teen might like a good time for looking into new opportunities is in a transition phase like before a new school year or at the start of the summer holidays these are times that various organizations clubs and teams are starting up 7 x research source you can look for camps or extra curricular activities at schools and camps there is usually a system where teens are exposed to and encouraged to try out various interests often without a full commitment suggest ideas for interests if your teen is struggling to find interests you can gently suggest things they might be interested it you have likely known your child their entire life so you will have an idea of what their interests are 8 x research source for example you can say you like being outdoors have you thought about running hiking or camping or there s a teen program for crafts this summer i thought you might be interested remember it is easy to go from insightful and helpful to nagging and suffocating teenagers dislike being pushed into things by parents and it may take finesse to coax adolescents into action mention possible enjoyable activities but limit the number of times you suggest the idea be supportive of your teen s hobbies even if they seem odd your teen may not like all the things you like or theirs you don t understand don t discourage them or tell them how weird you find it this could hurt a core part of your teen s identity instead support their interests as long as it is safe does not detract from healthy relationships and so on 9 x research source it would be terrible to convince your teen to do something and then be too busy to help them enjoy it always be proud of what your teen accomplishes if you know a lot about the hobby offer a small amount of constructive criticism if asked avoid taking over a project remember this is their hobby and project not yours structure life to support hobbies one of the most important things you can do is help structure family life so that there is time to enjoy hobbies this means making sure there is some free time for the teen along with making sure this free time is not devoured by things like video games social media and tv 10 x research source provide resources and support you are probably the one in charge of funding the hobbies to some extent you may also have knowledge expertise and social connections that might help out place limits on media use for example no video games after dinnertime instead your teen can spend time on their hobby avoid over scheduling sometimes there is a fine line between a happily occupied busy kid and one that has no time to just hang around with friends at the comic book store participate in a hobby of your own you are most likely to get a positive response to your teen choosing a hobby if you engage in hobbies by participating in a hobby you are modeling how rewarding and fun hobbies can be and how important they are for a balanced life 11 x research source for example if you want your child to read for fun model this behavior by reading in your spare time and talking about books respect your teen s changing interests teenagers are constantly changing growing and discovering new things if your child does not want to do a hobby respect it a teen may have been really excited about knitting last year but not this year 12 x research source insisting your teen finish a class camp or semester is sometimes a tough call some teens have a tendency to give up too easily and need a parent to help prevent them from quitting too quickly generally insisting on finishing a certain amount of time will help prevent that like a week long tennis camp however if it really looks like a teen is not having fun discontinuing the hobby may well be wise remember that your teen may not share your hobbies sure doing things together is one of the great pleasures of being a parent but parents and children may not share the same hobbies the idea behind hobbies is to enjoy it for its own sake whether or not your child shares the same hobbies don t force your teen to like only what you like or discourage hobbies that you do not understand 13 x research source for example it may be easy to make fun of a teen s achievements in minecraft but doing so would certainly put them off to opening up to you sometimes you may not think you have the exact same interest but discover they are not so different for instance maybe your teen shows no interest in playing poker but they love getting together and playing role playing games realize that your teen may be very busy though you want your teen to cultivate all sorts of hobbies and interests teenagers are very busy people there are many things that occupy their time beyond school sports homework work volunteering test prep and driver s education they may not have as much time for hobbies as they did a few years ago 14 x research source teenagers are also developing a more sophisticated social life which requires meeting up with friends having romantic relationships going to social events and keeping in touch on text and social networks your teen may not have as much time to engage in hobbies as it may seem at first glance teenagers may need just plain downtime without yet another demand sometimes after a full day he or she may not have the mental or physical energy to just do a hobby he or she may just want to watch a video or have a soak in the tub demanding to do a hobby when exhausted is counter productive provide opportunities for your child to participate in hobbies you should encourage your child to engage in their hobbies but do not demand it or put a lot of pressure on them forcing a teen to do something they do not want to do may result in the opposite outcome than you want 15 x research source for example if you think your teen would enjoy sailing a summer camp that offers sailing lessons is a great way of exploring however if they do not ultimately like sailing that should be fine too suggest an activity with friends maybe your teen acts they could care less about a specific activity but often teens will become interested if you let them do it with a friend suggest to your child that they join a club with a friend or bring a friend along when you take them to do the activity 16 x research source for example your child may enjoy cooking classes more with a friend instead of alone avoid forcing your teen to do any hobby if you are tempted to force your teen to try something it is unlikely to end well it will only lead to resentment there is probably a reason your teen didn t want to do the activity in the first place hobbies should be fun and geared towards a person s interest so forcing your teen to do anything goes against that idea 17 x research source if you are desperate have your teen try something for just a week

how to make a bouncy ball,bouncy balls are a fun toy and a cool science demonstration the most popular recipe uses borax but if you don t want to use that you can make bouncy balls using other materials such as liquid latex or rainbow loom bands,mix 1 2 cup 120 ml of warm water and 1 tablespoon of borax pour 1 2 cup 120 ml of warm water into a cup add 1 tablespoon 25 g of borax then stir the 2 ingredients together with a fork or spoon until the borax dissolves set the cup aside 1 x research source you can find borax in the laundry aisle of most grocery stores don t get borax on your skin or you may have an allergic reaction if you are messy put on a pair of plastic or rubber gloves if you want to make a multicolor ball prepare a separate borax solution one for each color that you will be using stir food coloring into 2 tablespoons 30 ml of white school glue pour 2 tablespoons 30 ml of white school glue into a different cup add 1 drop of food coloring and give it a stir if the shade isn t dark enough add another drop of food coloring and see how you like it 2 x research source you can use clear school glue as well the ball will end up being a little translucent 3 x research source if you want a multicolor ball simply repeat the process with more glue and different colors instead of food coloring you could try a few drops of paint instead try glow in the dark paint to make a glow in the dark ball 4 x research source add 1 tablespoon 9 g of cornstarch into the glue measure out 1 tablespoon 9 g of cornstarch and add it to the glue mixture stir the 2 together until they combine the cornstarch will make the glue even thicker 5 x research source if you can t find cornstarch use cornflour instead don t use cornmeal though if you are making a multicolor ball you ll need 1 tablespoon 9g of cornstarch per color pour the glue mixture into the borax solution make sure that you get all of the glue mixture into the borax solution use a regular spoon or rubber spatula to scrape the excess glue out and into the borax solution do not stir the ingredients 6 x research source if you don t get all of the glue into the cup with the borax solution your ball may not turn out as big if you are making a multicolor ball pour each glue color into its own borax solution wait 10 seconds then take the lump out of the borax solution after about 10 seconds or so the glue will harden into a lump use a fork or slotted spoon to lift the lump out of the borax solution 7 x research source don t use a spoon you don t want to take any of the borax solution out roll the lump into a ball until it becomes firm the borax should be harmless by this point but if you have sensitive skin it would be a good idea to put on a pair of gloves first roll the glue lump between your palms to make a ball try to make it as neat as possible 8 x research source if you are making a multicolor ball roll all of the colors together to make 1 big ball 9 x research source add some glitter into your palm as you roll the lump the lump will pick up the glitter as it rolls into a sparkly ball 10 x research source place the ball back into the borax solution for a few seconds take the ball and carefully lower it into the borax solution with a spoon do not plop it in or it will splash borax water everywhere wait a few seconds then take it out and pat it dry with a towel 11 x research source this will help solidify the ball and make it less sticky if you are making a big multicolor ball pour all of the borax solutions into a single cup first be aware that if you added glitter to your ball some of it may come off during this point keep the ball in an airtight container when you aren t playing with it you can bounce this ball just like any other bouncy ball because it is made from glue however it will eventually dry out after a couple of days you can make it last longer by putting it into a zippered baggy or airtight container when you aren t playing with it 12 x research source the ball should be ready to play with as soon as you are done rolling it if it still feels too wet let it dry for about 10 to 15 minutes the ball will start to flatten when you don t play with it if that happens simply roll it back into shape pour 1 tablespoon 15 ml of liquid latex into a plastic cup you can buy liquid latex online or in costume stores it is used to help blend latex prosthetics into your skin the most common color is peach but you can get it in white too for best results use white liquid latex this way you can change the color if you use peach the food coloring will make it turn muddy do not use clear liquid latex it does not have the same ingredients stir some food coloring into the liquid latex start with 1 drop of food coloring stir it in until no streaks remain if the color is too light for you add more food coloring because you are working with such a small amount however 1 to 2 drops should be plenty add 1 tablespoon 15 ml of white vinegar into the liquid latex this is where the magic starts to happen liquid latex contains polymer micro particles a preservative such as ammonia helps keep them in liquid form when you add vinegar however you neutralize the ammonia this allows you to shape the liquid latex stir the ingredients together to form a blob then roll it into a ball use a spoon or craft stick to stir the ingredients together as you stir them the liquid latex will clump together to form a lump once the lump forms take it out and roll it into a ball with your hands the ball may end up looking wrinkled but this won t stop it from bouncing poke the ball with a needle to drain the liquid there is still going to be some vinegar trapped inside the ball so you need to get rid of it stick a needle or pin into the ball then pull it out carefully squeeze the ball to drain the vinegar out point the hole away from your eyes so that the vinegar doesn t accidentally squirt into your face set the ball on a paper towel to dry this should only take a few minutes but if you can t wait you can gently pat the ball dry with a towel once the ball is dry you can bounce it around store the ball in an airtight container when you aren t playing with it the ball will eventually shrink and harden as time goes by but you can make it last longer by keeping it in a plastic zippered baggie or an airtight container when you aren t using it after a week or so the ball will eventually start to dry out and harden once it stops bouncing you should discard it scrunch up a broken rainbow loom bracelet if you don t have any you can make a simple rainbow loom bracelet then scrunch it up into a ball 13 x research source you can also take several regular rubber bands like the kind used for newspapers and roll them into a ball the color of the bracelet or rubber bands does not matter use the entire bracelet don t take it apart this will up create the center of the ball slip 2 rainbow loom bands over the scrunched up bracelet keep your finger hooked over both bands don t let go of them just yet the color of the bands does not matter because you will be adding more layers 14 x research source you are using 2 bands because it will make things faster you don t have to use the actual rainbow loom brand you can use an off brand or a generic brand as long as the bands look like the rainbow loom bands you re good twist the bands then loop them back over the scrunched up bracelet hold the bracelet between your fingers in 1 hand twist your other hand in order to twist the bands loop the bands back over onto the scrunched up bracelet then let go 15 x research source continue to add bands until the ball is half the size you want it to be always work 2 bands at a time twist each set of bands as you wrap them around the ball alternate the directions you wrap the bands in so that the entire ball gets covered again the color does not matter at this point 16 x research source if your first set of bands was horizontal make the next set vertical and the next 2 sets diagonal the finished ball will be about 2 inches 5 1 cm in diameter your ball should be about 1 inch 2 5 cm at this point wrap more bands around your ball but use the colors you want again take 2 bands then wrap and twist them around your ball this time start using the colors you want your ball to be when your ball is about two thirds of its final size stop 17 x research source you can use all 1 color or you can use multiple colors your ball should be about 1 2 3 inches 4 2 cm at this point add more bands without twisting until the ball reaches its final size continue to use bands in the color you want your ball to be this time just wrap them around the ball but without twisting them this will help make your ball bouncier 18 x research source you should still be using 2 bands at the same time your ball will be about 2 inches 5 1 cm at this point add 2 to 3 more sets of bands with a twist take 2 bands and stretch them around your ball give them a twist and slip them back over the ball do this 1 or 2 more times alternating directions this will help hold everything together 19 x research source you should still use the colors you want your ball to be for this step play with the ball this type of ball is very bouncy keep in mind that the bands may come off if you play too rough with it if that happens simply put the band on twist the bands as you put them on 20 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to sew wool by hand,wool is an incredibly versatile material to work with this natural fiber is known for its durability and absorbency which makes it great for outerwear it can also be thick and fuzzy so it s perfect for appliqué projects where you want to add a little texture before you begin learn a few tips and techniques to make hand stitching wool easier and more enjoyable,choose woolen fabrics or worsted woolen fabrics for your project wool comes in a tremendous variety of weights textures and styles so it s important to find the right one for your project woolen fabrics are inexpensive fuzzy and easy to felt so they re great for felt appliqué blankets or outerwear for stronger more durable clothing or upholstery look for worsted woolen fabrics which have longer wool fibers 1 x research source for example if you re making a dress or suit pick gabardine or twill material for a medium weight skirt or rug use flannel or tweed prewash your wool fabric or felt and air dry it completely wool does have a tendency to shrink so it s best to wash and dry it before you cut it for your project if you re using wool fabric read the care instructions to see if you can machine wash it on a gentle cycle if you re unsure or you re working with felt wash it by hand squeeze your fabric gently to remove most of the water and then lay it flat to air dry 2 x research source don t twist or wring the fabric or felt because this can damage the fibers use sharp scissors or a rotary cutter to cut the wool if you re working with woolen fabric lay it flat and use scissors to cut it according to your pattern to cut small pieces or woolen felt lay the material on a cutting mat and use a rotary cutter to create the pieces 3 x research source if you re cutting really small pieces of felt use short scissors so they re easy to handle lay a press cloth over the dry wool before you iron it smooth it s easy to accidentally damage the wool with an iron that s too hot if you need to smooth your woolen fabric lay a dry cloth over the material and use your iron on the wool setting this setting uses steam so the fibers don t dry out and shrink 4 x research source if you re using dark wool or lightweight worsted wool lay the wrong side of the fabric on your ironing board before putting the press cloth on it this prevents the fabric from becoming shiny to prevent color transfer use a white press cloth if you re ironing light colored wool pick a sharp hand needle that matches the weight of your fabric sharp needles are key for stitching through bulky wool fabric or felt if you re hand sewing fabric choose a needle size that matches the fabric weight for example if you re sewing a medium weight woolen use size 70 10 to 80 12 needles heavy weight fabric needs 90 14 size needles 5 x research source if you re using embroidery floss for an appliqué project you can use a sharp hand needle or an embroidery needle depending on which is easier for you to thread use a medium weight thread or embroidery floss since wool is a heftier fabric than most lightweight blends choose medium weight cotton silk or wool thread if you ll be hand stitching wool felt select embroidery floss so it will show up easily on the felt 6 x research source embroidery floss comes in different materials so you could use cotton floss if you want a thinner design or wool floss which comes in double strands for a thicker look make the whip stitch to create an angled edge for the wool to quickly sew the edges of wool pieces together stack them so they line up bring a threaded needle through the middle of the pieces and up through the top layer near the edge then draw the needle from the bottom up through both layers so the needle comes out about 1 8 inch 0 32 cm to the side of where you started 7 x research source as you work the whip stitch you ll see it form a slight angle along the edge of the wool fabric work a blanket stitch for a straighter edge to create a crisp edge that holds your layers of wool together do the blanket stitch stack the edges of your wool and insert a threaded needle between the layers and up through the top layer insert your needle from the bottom layer up through the spot you just pulled through before you pull the loop tightly insert your needle through it and pull it from left to right 8 x research source starting the blanket stitch in the middle of your wool layers hides the knot trim the edges to reduce bulk from the seams wool is notoriously bulky so you might find that the seams of a garment bulge out to make your seams more flexible take a pair of scissors and cut the excess fabric to about 1 4 inch 0 64 cm from your seam allowance 9 x research source if you re working with a collar or neckline your patten might direct you to grade the edge this means you need to trim just the top layer of the seam allowance so you have enough fabric on the bottom to enclose the seam allowance,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tie a rapala knot,a rapala fishing knot is a strong loop knot that s used to connect your hook lure or leader to your fishing line it s named after the company that made it and its advantage is that it allows your lure to move freely and more naturally through the water increasing your chances of attracting fish it s also easy to tie if you follow the proper steps and you can use it for any type of fishing line and any type of lure,make an overhand loop about 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm from the tag end the tag end sometimes called the working end is the end of the fishing line where you ll tie your knot to attach your hook or lure hold the line with your fingers and form a simple overhand loop near the end by looping the line over itself to make a small loose circle 1 x research source the end of the line that s coming from the fishing reel is known as the standing line don t pull the overhand loop tight keep it open and loose so you can fit your line through it thread the tag end through the eye of the hook the eye of the hook or hook eye is the small opening at the top of the hook that you use to tie it to a fishing line take the tag end of your line and slide it through the eye of your hook so the hook is positioned about halfway between the overhand loop and the end of the line 2 x research source pinch near the very end of the line to hold it so it stays straight and you can slide it into the eye of the hook easier pull the tag end through the overhand loop on the line with the hook on the line take the tag end of the line and bring it up and over the eye of the hook slide the tag end through the overhand loop on the line and pull it through just enough so there s about 1 inch 2 5 cm of the tag end of the line sticking out of the overhand loop 3 x research source don t pull the main line or tighten the overhand loop this will also form a small loop that holds the eye of the hook wrap the tag end around the main line 3 5 times hold the hook in your hand and pinch the overhand loop to stabilize the line take the tag end of the line that s sticking out of the overhand loop with your other hand and wrap it loosely around the main fishing line 3 5 times 4 x research source don t pull the line tight so you can keep forming your knot bring the tag end through the bottom facing side of the overhand loop keep the tag end of the line held in your hand after you wrap it around the line and thread it through the underside of the overhand loop held in your other hand slide enough of the tag end through to take hold of it on the other side of the overhand loop but don t pull it tight 5 x research source sliding the tag end through the underside of the overhand loop will create a small new loop just above the overhand loop insert the tag end through the new loop above the overhand loop once you insert the tag end through the underside of the overhand loop take the end and bring it down through the small loop that is formed just above it pull the tag end through the new loop but don t pull the knot tight 6 x research source the tag end and the main line should now be parallel to each other tighten the knot by pulling the tag end main line and hook hold the tag end and the main line in 1 hand and the hook in the other pull them in opposite directions to tighten the rapala knot on the hook then let go of the tag end and pull just the main line and the hook in opposite directions to make the knot as tight as possible 7 x research source if there s a small amount of slack on the overhand loop pull just the tag end and the hook to remove it cut off the excess length of the line at the tag end use a knife pair of scissors or a pair of nail clippers to trim the tag end of the line just above the rapala knot cut the line so the end is flush with the knot and there isn t any excess sticking out 8 x research source braided line can t be cut with nail clippers so use scissors instead,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to keep hobby costs down,do you love your hobbies but don t have the money to pursue them to the full extent you d like it s not a hopeless cause here are some good ways to keep your spending in check and still have lots of fun in your free time,pursue less costly hobbies it s a fair bet that writing will cost less than motorcycle racing money isn t the only reason to choose or avoid a hobby but you should certainly consider the costs choose hobbies that require time creativity skill ingenuity or knowledge rather than money or gear light aircraft flying designer shopping car modding and playing the latest video games are all likely to be expensive hobbies perhaps saving up for them in the future is a better approach than trying to participate in them now without the money needed to make them enjoyable keep ancillary costs down gardening isn t a cheap hobby if you decide you need a riding mower and a pickup truck to get it done or if you change plants as often as you change clothes instead enjoy the challenge and the rewards of growing from seed transplants and cuttings get smaller plants cheaply and grow them into larger ones learn to save seeds if you like to grow vegetables or other annuals on the other hand if you have a large area to mow a riding mower might be worth the investment especially if it frees up your time to enjoy the gardening as a whole could you share both the mower and the cost with neighbors stay close to home if you have to drive for hours to see snow don t ski find something else to do outdoors such as skating or bicycling learn the hobby well before you buy or upgrade too much gear you can learn a lot about photography with a 20 secondhand camera and some practice you can do a lot of astronomy with your own eyes or with the pair of binoculars you already own learning the hobby first is also a good way to avoid having stacks of leftover stuff if you tend to switch around frequently borrow or rent to try out hobbies that require large investments in gear such as mountain climbing or hang gliding before you start buying if you find you dislike them or simply don t have time to pursue them you won t be left with a lot of depreciating equipment learn to be resourceful rather than spend money look for used equipment and materials opportunities many hobbyists sell their good condition equipment through clubs in the newspaper and online stick to hobbies and projects that you like if you enjoy doing something do more of it using what you already have rather than starting new hobbies or projects frequently sometimes you can use common equipment and build common skills for a single basic activity while enjoying it in very different contexts for instance if you re now a classical violinist you might enjoy fiddling for folk music too 1 x research source if you re now a wedding portrait documentary or wildlife photographer you might enjoy sports photography don t buy a monster lens just increase the iso a bit and while you re at it learn how to deal with the jumpiest subjects possible this doesn t mean you shouldn t try new things it does mean that you should stay the course complete projects and master the hobbies you have already chosen to pursue before chasing new ones consider new purchases carefully for equipment choose durable items that will last a long time and give you plenty of use assuming you will pursue a hobby for a long time to come plan for your supplies to last a long time maintain your equipment once you have good durable equipment do what is necessary to keep it in good working order often minor maintenance along the way can prevent major maintenance later on whether it means rinsing your swimsuit or oiling your sewing machine take the time to keep your gear in good shape buy only the supplies you know you will use you can t knit without yarn or quilt without fabric but that doesn t mean you need to stockpile or hoard yarn try to have a project in mind before purchasing supplies for some creative pastimes it is worth keeping some supplies around so that they re available when inspiration strikes if this is the way you pursue your hobby gradually build up a reasonable selection of supplies as your budget permits then try to acquire supplies at about the same rate you use them keeping your stash at a reasonable level will also help make it easy to organize try to use up your supplies or outgrow your gear before buying more keep in mind supplies that go out of stock or change with time for example paint or fabric patterns might change if you don t get enough at the beginning of your project in this case stockpiling is a safeguard of quality rather than hoarding learn to make the most of simple materials some people do incredible photorealistic drawings with a basic ballpoint pen woodworkers sometimes hold 2x4 contests where the objective is to make something wonderful from a single building grade 2x4 board get a better price buy used if it makes sense to do so many people stop pursuing hobbies after a time and sell or discard perfectly good used equipment and supplies watch for sales and bargains on the items you buy new

how to remove needle marks from fabric,tiny needle holes are inevitable when you unpick a hem remove embroidery or take off a pocket fortunately a few simple tricks can restore the fabric and make it look perfectly smooth you don t even need fancy tools grab a spoon and heat up an iron you ll use a combination of moisture heat and scraping the fabric to remove those irritating needle marks,spray the fabric with water to relax the fibers fill a clean spray bottle with water and squirt enough water on the holes to moisten the fabric fibers since your goal is to fill the tiny holes with the fabric s own fibers loosening the fibers makes them easier to adjust 1 x research source if you re fixing delicate fabrics like silk or satin don t spray them with water since this can damage the material scrape your nail or a spoon from side to side over a needle mark to help close up the tiny holes in horizontal threads scrape the tip of your fingernail or the edge of a spoon from side to side do this for each needle mark 2 x research source if your fabric is thick or stiff press firmly as you scrape over the holes fabric is made by weaving threads vertically and horizontally the horizontal threads are the weft threads of the fabric scratch your nail or spoon up and down over the hole once you ve brought the weft fibers together scrape up and down to shift the vertical fibers repeat this for each needle mark as you work the needle marks should close up 3 x research source the vertical threads of fabric are the warp threads repeat the process if you still see needle marks depending on your fabric the needle marks might be completely invisible if you can still spot them spray the fabric with water again and scrape your fingernail or spoon over the holes then look for needle marks 4 x research source the number of times you repeat the process depends on the size of the needle marks the fabric material and the material s thread count flip the fabric over and repeat the process once you ve worked on 1 side of the fabric turn it over repeat all of the steps to completely close the needle marks keep in mind that you probably won t need to spend as much time scraping this side of the fabric 5 x research source spritz the fabric with water and leave it for a few minutes pour water into a clean spray bottle and squirt water onto the needle marks let the fabric absorb the moisture and sit for a few minutes so the fibers relax this makes the needle marks close easily 6 x research source avoid spraying delicate fabrics like silk or satin with water since moisture could damage them you can also try tossing the fabric in your washing machine and running a cycle in some cases this is all it takes to hide the needle marks heat an iron according to your fabric type set up an ironing board and set your iron on it then read the care label for the fabric and heat your iron to the appropriate setting for example if you re working with cotton heat the iron to medium high heat 7 x research source if you re unsure which temperature to use heat the iron to warm press the iron onto the needle marked fabric spread the fabric on an ironing board and press the iron directly onto the needle marks hold it in place for about 10 seconds before you lift the iron off if there are several needle marks run your iron over the area to help close the holes 8 x research source use steam on the fabric if it can handle the heat and moisture the pressure and steam from the iron help the fibers shift back into place use a seam ripper to cut through hand stitches or machine stitches a seam ripper is a great tool for pulling out a row or just a few stitches the seam ripper looks like a small sharp hook that you slide under the stitch then pull up sharply to slice the stitch repeat this anywhere on the fabric where you want to remove stitches 9 x research source turn the fabric over and work on the backside to minimize the size of the needle marks run a stitch eraser over the fabric to remove embroidery stitches if you d like to take out sturdy embroidery stitches that were made by a machine buy a stitch eraser which looks like small hair clippers or trimmers turn the fabric to the backside and slowly hold the stitch eraser over the embroider to shave the threads then brush away the loose threads 10 x research source you can buy a stitch eraser at your local craft store or online hold the eraser blade so it s perpendicular to the embroidery threads take a pair of tweezers and pluck the loose stitches out of the fabric once you ve sliced through the stitches or used the stitch eraser use tweezers to pull the loose strands of thread from the fabric 11 x research source if it s easier use your fingertips to pull the stitches out,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build a blinking light circuit using basic components,building a blinking light circuit is a great method to introduce yourself to the electronics world the art of building circuits that serve a purpose has been around for many years but the beauty of this circuit is that it can be built by buying only a handful of components that will not cost a lot of money,buy all the required materials you will need 100 kiloohms trimmer breadboard potentiometer two 9 volts batteries 22 microfarad capacitor one led light can be red blue green or white breadboard two 1 kilohms resistors one 100 ohms resistor lm 741 amplifier and jumping wires read the manual that comes with the amplifier the purpose of this step is to learn how the pins are numbered on the amplifier usually the first pin is located on the top left corner there is usually a little dot to indicate it and the 8th pin is located on the top right corner pin number 2 is called the inverting input pin number 3 is called the non inverting input pin number 6 is the amplifier output pin number 4 and pin number 7 are used to power up the circuit read the manual that comes with the breadboard the purpose of this step is to fully understand how the breadboard works usually the rows are connected the ground is located at one of the sides some breadboards have different segments so it s a good idea to read the manual before building place the amplifier in the middle of the breadboard the purpose of placing the amplifier in the middle is to have enough space to work with on the top and the bottom make sure the little dot on the amplifier is on the top right corner to make identifying pins easier place the trimmer on the breadboard note that the trimmer has three pins however only the middle and one of the side pins will be used make sure that each pin is placed on a different row connect the capacitor to pin number 2 on the amplifier note some capacitors are polarized the two leads of the capacitor have different lengths connect the longer lead to pin number 2 on the amplifier connect the shorter lead to the ground using jumping wires may be required it depends how far is the ground pins if the capacitor is not polarized both leads will have the same length connect the pins for the potentiometer by using jumping wires connect the middle pin on the potentiometer to pin number 2 on the amplifier make sure that pin number 2 of the amplifier one side of the capacitor and the middle pin of the potentiometer are connected on the same row connect one of the potentiometer s side pins to pin number 6 of the amplifier output pin the remaining pin is unused place one of 1 kiloohms resistors on the beadboard all resistors have two sides connect the first side to pin number 6 and the second side to any close empty row place the second 1 kiloohms resistor on the breadboard connect one side to the same row as the first 1 kiloohms resistor to the same close empty row connect the second side to the ground using jumping wire may be necessary because the resistor is not long enough place the 100 ohms resistor on the breadboard choose two empty rows in between the two the 1 kiloohms resistors and connect the 100 kiloohms resistor across of them by using a jumping wire connect the bottom row to the ground place a jumping wire between the row where the two 1 kiloohms resistors intersect and pin number 3 place the led light on the breadboard connect the longer lead to pin number 6 and the shorter lead to the same top row for the 100 kiloohms resistor power up the circuit by using two 9 volts batteries connect the negative side of the first battery to pin number 4 and the positive side to the ground connect the positive side of the second battery to the to pin number 7 and the negative side to the ground turn the knob on the potentiometer to speed up or slow down the blinking by turning the potentiometer the total resistance will be changed and that will change the charging and discharging frequency for the capacitor place the lm 741 i the middle of the screen to place any components in multisim click on place components in the toolbar then click on the search button on the side after selecting the component double click on it to place it on the screen place the capacitor on the screen if 22 microfarad is not found place any capacitor then double click on it to change the value place a common ground or multiple grounds to place the ground go to place components and find it under power sources double click on the screen to get virtual wires double click on the screen at the starting point then move the cursor to the ending point then click the mouse again this method has to be used for all required connections connect the capacitor connect one side to pin number 2 on the amplifier inverting pin connect another side to the common ground search for all components search and place all the remaining components by using the same method as the previous steps connect the potentiometer connect the first side of the potentiometer to pin number 2 and the second side to pin number 6 output connect the two 1 kiloohms resistor connect the two of them together connect one side to pin number 6 connect another side to the common ground connect the non inverting pin pin number 3 by using a virtual wire connect pin number 3 to the intersection between the two 1 kiloohms resistors connect the led light connect the positive side of the led to one of the leads of the 100 ohms resistor connect the second lead of the 100 ohms resistor to the common ground power up the virtual circuit power up the virtual circuit by connecting the negative side of the first dc power source battery to pin number 4 and the positive side to the common ground also connect the positive side of the second battery to pin number 7 and the negative side to the common ground change the resistance percentage on the virtual potentiometer by changing the percentage the speed of the blinking light will change compare all the connections to the schematic provided in this step the purpose of this step is to make sure that all connections in the previous steps have been done correctly,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to make organza flowers,if you re trying to save money and don t want to buy expensive bouquets create realistic flowers with organza this sheer synthetic fabric is a great budget option and your flowers will last for years you can cut individual petals and singe the edges with a candle to make them curl a little or gather a long piece of organza to make a puffy textured flower either way you ll have fun making these long lasting flowers,purchase silk or synthetic organza in any color decide if you want to use a single color of fabric or buy a few different shades to get a realistic look for example if you want to sew a red organza flower choose a deep red a lighter red and a pale red the slight color variation will make your flower look more natural 1 x research source you might find organdie or organdy for sale near the organza don t use this for your flowers since it s made of cotton and won t curl like organza the amount of fabric you need depends on the size of your flowers and how many layers you use cut out 2 or 3 circular templates in a few different widths get out a large piece of cardboard and find a plate or glass that s as wide as you want to make the flower set it on the cardboard trace around the side of the plate or glass to make a circle and cut it out then make another 1 or 2 templates that are each 1 2 to 1 inch 1 3 to 2 5 cm smaller 2 x research source for example make 1 circle template that s 5 inches 13 cm in diameter 1 template that s 4 inches 10 cm and a template that s 3 inches 7 6 cm lay the templates on the fabric and cut at least 5 or 6 fabric circles spread your organza on a flat surface and place the templates on the fabric run fabric chalk or a pencil around each circle then cut out the circles although you can make as many circles in any sizes you like cut a total of at least 5 or 6 circles 3 x research source keep in mind that more layers make a fuller flower for example if you d like a really full flower work with around a dozen circles hold the edge of a fabric circle above a candle flame to singe it to make the edges of your flower petals curl a little light a candle and hold an organza circle 1 2 in 1 3 cm above the flame put it just close enough so the heat melts the edge of the fabric slowly move the circle to quickly singe all around the fabric edge 4 x research source singe every petal so they look like they re curling open a little set a glass of water near your work surface so you can quickly extinguish fabric if it catches on fire stack your curled layers from largest to smallest to assemble an organza flower lay a few of the largest circles on your work surface then set 2 or 3 slightly smaller circles on them finish your flower by putting a few of the smallest circles on top 5 x research source you don t need to perfectly stack the circles in fact keeping them a little off center makes the petals more interesting and unique thread a needle and sew through the center to hold the flower in place use thread that matches the color of your fabric and insert the needle through the bottom of the flower pull the needle up through the center of all the layers and bring the needle back down through the center continue sewing back and forth to make stitches that secure the flower 6 x research source if you don t want to sew the flower use a hot glue gun to stick each layer together use caution when working with the hot glue so you don t burn yourself tie the thread and trim the tail cut the thread tail close to the knot so it doesn t hang below the flower then you can glue or sew small beads onto the center of the flower if you want to hide the stitches glue a small felt circle onto the bottom of the flower if you want to make a flat base for it this can make it easier to attach the flower onto other projects cut a strip of organza so it s 3 to 4 inches 7 6 to 10 2 cm wide unroll organza fabric in any color and cut a piece that s at least 12 inches 30 cm long and 3 to 4 inches 7 6 to 10 2 cm wide for a flower that s about 5 inches 13 cm across cut the strip so it s about 40 inches 100 cm long 7 x research source fold the strip of fabric into a rectangle fold 1 end of the fabric onto the opposite end so the strip is half its original length then bring the folded edge over to the opposite end keep folding the fabric until you have a rectangle that s around 2 inches 5 1 cm across 8 x research source since you ve folded the fabric you ll only need to cut the petal shape once so this is a quick method for making flowers cut the top of the folded fabric to make a curved edge hold the folded fabric and use scissors to cut a curve along the top you can throw away the fabric scraps and unfold the fabric strip to see the scalloped edge you just cut 9 x research source don t cut the bottom of the fabric or you ll have trouble holding onto the flower when you shape it hold the scalloped edges over a candle flame if you want to curl the petals light a small candle and carefully hold just the curved edge of the fabric 1 2 inch 1 3 cm above the flame it only takes a second for the heat from the candle to singe the organza so keep moving the scalloped edge over the flame until you ve worked across the whole strip of fabric 10 x research source if you aren t trying to create realistic petals you can skip this step fold the strip of fabric in half crosswise and thread a needle spread out the scalloped strip of organza take 1 end of the fabric and fold it so it s almost lined up with the opposite end then thread a needle with thread that matches the color of the organza and tie a knot in the end 11 x research source you don t need to line the scallops up perfectly the flower will actually look more realistic if you overlap the scallops so they re slightly off center work a running stitch across the bottom of the folded fabric strip insert your needle at the end of the strip so it goes through both layers of fabric leave about 1 4 inch 0 64 cm of space and push the needle back down through the fabric make a stitch back up through the fabric and leave another gap keep doing the running stitch until you reach the folded end of the fabric 12 x research source the running stitch is also called the basting stitch pull the thread to gather the flower and sew the bottom of the flower once you ve stitched to the end of the fabric strip pull the thread gently as you pull the fabric will ruffle and gather bring the ends of the flower together and insert your needle into the other fabric end then sew back and forth across the bottom of the flower so the layers stay in place 13 x research source cut the thread and trim the excess to finish your flower cut the thread tail close to the knot so you don t see it trailing under the base of the flower if you plan on attaching the flowers to other decorations glue a small felt circle to the bottom of the flower this gives you a base to attach to the other crafts 14 x research source choose 1 color or a few complementary shades to make flowers if you re making the flower with individual circle petals you can use several different shades of a color when you stack the circles the different shades make the flower look more realistic to keep things simple or to make the ruffled flower just choose 1 color of organza fabric 15 x research source for example to make a vibrant pink flower stack dark pink petals with pale pink petals on top then place white or cream petals in the center for the flower bud create small flowers if you want to attach them to jewelry cards or headbands make organza flowers that are less than 1 inch 2 5 cm across and then hot glue them onto a headband or hairclip for a cute floral hair accessory you can also glue tiny flowers onto cards banners or signs if you want them to have a fun spring look 16 x research source make large organza flowers to create wreaths or home decor projects buy a wooden or metal wreath frame and hot glue large flowers around the edge attach just a few to one side if you want an asymmetrical look or surround the entire frame with flowers to give it a full effect play around with using different colors or sizes to make your wreath really stand out 17 x research source to make a nice table display hot glue the bottom of organza flowers to napkin rings you can also scatter small organza across the table for a whimsical look assemble a custom flower bouquet with organza flowers if you re looking to save money on fresh flowers or just want a bouquet that will last for years slide small green floral wire through the bottom of your organza flowers then wrap floral tape around the base of the flower or hot glue the wire in place gather several flower stems together and wrap a ribbon around the center to secure the bouquet 18 x research source make your bouquet as full or simplistic as you like for example try mixing different types of flowers or using organza flowers in different

how to cut out letters,cutting out your own letters is a great way to make signs for the classroom or your home however it can be a pain to sketch out each letter individually especially if you re cutting out a lot of them thankfully you can make your letters look even and uniform without spending ages using stencils or a pattern,cut out rectangles in the size you want your letters it s much easier to start with pieces of paper that are the size and basic shape you want your letters to be try 8 by 5 inches 20 by 13 cm rectangles for poster sized letters and use sharp scissors to cut them out evenly 1 x research source draw a 1 in 2 5 cm grid on your rectangles with a ruler and a pencil you don t have to use a grid on your letters but if you want them to be perfectly symmetrical it helps a lot use a ruler to measure 1 in 2 5 cm blocks on all your letters and trace a grid lightly with pencil 2 x research source if you don t mind your letters looking slightly uneven or you have a lot of letters to cut out you don t have to use a grid make sure you outline your grid in pencil so you can erase it later on round the corners of the rectangles that will be an o c g or q take your scissors and hold them on 1 corner of a rectangle cut the point of the corner off at an angle so that it comes out rounded and smooth then cut the rest of the points off you can do this for any letters that have rounded edges 3 x research source if you drew a grid on your rectangles curve the corners so that half of 1 grid square is cut off on each corner try to stick with upper case letters to make it easier lower case letters have more curves that are difficult to cut out if you re okay with it try to stick with all upper case letters for a more chunky blocky look 4 x research source this will also help your sign look more uniform cut the edges of your letters to get them started once you know which letters you d like to cut out start out with the ones that only use straight lines like e n and a cut off the sides of the paper in straight lines to start making the shapes of your letters 5 x research source for example if you are cutting an a make 2 diagonal cuts on either side of the rectangle to make the basic shape if you are making an e cut out 2 small rectangles on the right side of your paper to cut out the lines on the right side of the letter if you re using the grid method you can use the lines of the grid to make sure your cuts are even on each side keep your cuts rounded for smooth letters letters like s g c and o have smooth corners when you start cutting them out don t cut in 1 straight line instead make your cuts rounded and smooth as you cut out the shapes for these letters 6 x research source if you drew a grid on your rectangles use the boxes to make sure that your curves are even on each side cut inside pieces by folding your paper in half for letters that have a chunk taken out of the middle like a and o gently fold your piece of paper in half trying not to crease it too much then use your scissors to make a small hole in the center of the paper unfold your paper so that it lies flat and use the hole you made to go in and cut out the inside of the letter 7 x research source you can use this trick for any letters that have cutouts in the center like a b d o p and q erase the grid from your letters if you used it take a large eraser and gently rub it over your letters to take away the grid use caution so that you don t accidentally rip any of your letters 8 x research source glue your letters to cardstock to make them stand out if you used construction paper or felt use a glue stick or liquid glue to attach your letters to some cardstock for a thicker eye catching back you can leave your cardstock in a single sheet or you can cut it out in the shape of each letter about 0 5 in 1 3 cm larger so that it sticks out 9 x research source adding cardstock is a great way to keep your letters around for a long time attach your letters to a poster with glue to hang them on the wall to make a sign out of your letters pick a thick piece of paper like cardstock and arrange your letters in order glue them down with a glue stick to keep them in place for a cute label activity guide or example question 10 x research source you can make your sign look more interesting by adding a decorative piece of paper behind your letters it can have a floral pattern bold stripes or polka dots make your letters bolder by outlining them in pencil if you ve glued your letters up and they don t stand out like you want them to try using a pen or dark pencil to draw a thick line around each letter this will give them a more defined shape as well as draw attention to them 11 x research source this is great for signs in the classroom that you want your students to focus on hang your letters on twine to make a banner reinforce your letters with cardstock and then hang a length of twine between 2 push pins use clothespins to hang up each letter individually to spell out your phrase or saying 12 x research source this is a great way to hang letters above a whiteboard or corkboard you can also use a hole punch to make holes in the top of each letter and then thread the twine through the holes,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to go to the moon,the moon is the closest body in space to earth with a mean distance of 238 857 miles 384 403 km 1 x research source the first probe to fly by the moon was the russian luna 1 launched january 2 1959 2 x research source ten years and six months later the apollo 11 mission landed neil armstrong and edwin buzz aldrin on the sea of tranquility july 20 1969 going to the moon is a task that to paraphrase john f kennedy requires the best of one s energies and skills 3 x research source,plan to go in stages despite the all in one rocket ships popular in science fiction stories going to the moon is a mission best broken into separate parts achieving low earth orbit transferring from earth to lunar orbit landing on the moon and reversing the steps to return to earth some science fiction stories that depicted a more realistic approach to going to the moon had astronauts going to an orbiting space station where smaller rockets were docked that would take them to the moon and back to the station because the united states was in competition with the soviet union this approach was not adopted the space stations skylab salyut and the international space station were all put up after project apollo had ended the apollo project used the three stage saturn v rocket the bottom most first stage lifted the assembly off the launching pad to a height of 42 miles 68 km the second stage boosted it almost to low earth orbit and the third stage pushed it into orbit and then toward the moon 4 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source the constellation project proposed by nasa for a return to the moon in 2018 consists of a two different two stage rockets there are two different first stage rocket designs a crew only lifting stage consisting of a single five segment rocket booster the ares i and a crew and cargo lifting stage consisting of five rocket engines beneath an external fuel tank supplemented by two five segment solid rocket boosters the ares v the second stage for both versions uses a single liquid fuel engine the heavy lifting assembly would carry the lunar orbital capsule and lander which the astronauts would transfer to when the two rocket systems dock 5 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source pack for the trip because the moon has no atmosphere you have to bring your own oxygen so you have something to breathe while you re there and when you stroll about on the lunar surface you need to be in a spacesuit to protect yourself from the blazing heat of the two week long lunar day or the mind numbing cold of the equally long lunar night not to mention the radiation and micro meteoroids the lack of atmosphere exposes the surface to 6 x research source you ll also need to have something to eat most of the foods used by the astronauts in space missions have to be freeze dried and concentrated to reduce their weight and then be reconstituted by adding water when eaten 7 x research source they also need to be high protein foods to minimize the amount of body waste generated after eating at least you can wash them down with tang everything you take into space with you adds weight which increases the amount of fuel necessary to lift it and the rocket carrying it into space so you won t be able to take too many personal effects into space and those lunar rocks will weigh 6 times as much on earth as they do on the moon determine the launch window a launch window is the time range for launching the rocket from earth to be able to land in the desired area of the moon during a time when there would be sufficient light for exploring the landing area the launch window was actually defined two ways as a monthly window and a daily window the monthly launch window takes advantage of where the planned landing area is with respect to the earth and the sun because earth s gravity forces the moon to keep the same side facing earth exploration missions were chosen in areas of the earth facing side to make radio communication between earth and the moon possible the time also had to be chosen at a time when the sun was shining on the landing area the daily launch window takes advantage of launch conditions such as the angle at which the spacecraft would be launched the performance of booster rockets and the presence of a ship downsite from the launch to track the rocket s flight progress early on light conditions for launching were important as daylight made it easier to oversee aborts on the launch pad or before achieving orbit as well as being able to document aborts with photographs as nasa gained more practice in overseeing missions daylight launches were less necessary apollo 17 was launched at night 8 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source lift off ideally a rocket bound for the moon should be launched vertically to take advantage of earth s rotation in helping it achieve orbital velocity however in project apollo nasa allowed for a possible range of 18 degrees either direction from vertical without significantly compromising the launch 9 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source achieve low earth orbit in escaping the pull of earth s gravity there are two velocities to consider escape velocity and orbital velocity escape velocity is the velocity needed to escape a planet s gravity completely while orbital velocity is the velocity needed to go into orbit around a planet escape velocity for earth s surface is about 25 000 mph or 7 miles per second 40 248 km hr or 11 2 km s while orbital velocity at the surface is 10 x research source 11 x research source orbital velocity for earth s surface is only around 18 000 mph 7 9 km s it takes less energy to achieve orbital velocity than escape velocity furthermore the values for orbital and escape velocity drop the further away from earth s surface you go with escape velocity always about 1 414 the square root of 2 times orbital velocity 12 x research source transition to a trans lunar trajectory after achieving low earth orbit and verifying that all ship s systems are functional it s then time to fire thrusters and go to the moon with project apollo this was done by firing the third stage thrusters one last time to propel the spacecraft toward the moon 13 x research source along the way the command service module csm separated from the third stage turned around and docked with the lunar excursion module lem carried in the upper part of the third stage with project constellation the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket the departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon achieve lunar orbit once the spacecraft enters the gravity of the moon fire the thrusters to slow it down and place it in orbit around the moon transfer to the lunar lander both project apollo and project constellation feature separate orbital and landing modules the apollo command module required that one of the three astronauts remain behind to pilot it while the other two boarded the lunar module 14 x research source project constellation s orbital capsule is designed to be run automatically so that all four of the astronauts it is designed to carry could board its lunar lander if desired 15 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source descend to the moon s surface because the moon has no atmosphere it is necessary to use rockets to slow the lunar lander s descent to about 100 mph 160 km hr to ensure an intact landing and slower still to guarantee its passengers a soft landing 16 x research source ideally the planned landing surface should be free of sizable boulders this is why the sea of tranquility was chosen as the landing site for apollo 11 17 x research source explore once you land on the moon it s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface while there you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on earth and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the apollo 15 16 and 17 missions did you can even hot rod on the lunar surface at up to 11 2 mph 18 km hr 18 x research source don t bother to rev the engine though the unit is battery powered and there s no air to carry the sound of a revving engine anyway pack up and go home after you ve done your business on the moon pack up your samples and tools and board your lunar lander for the return trip the apollo lunar module was designed in two stages a descent stage to get it down to the moon and an ascent stage to lift the astronauts back into lunar orbit the descent stage was left behind on the moon and so also was the lunar rover 19 x research source 20 x research source dock with the orbiting vessel the apollo command module and the constellation orbital capsule are both designed to take astronauts from the moon back to earth the

bracketing if your camera has it you can then use layer masks in your favourite image editing software to paint in areas from the underexposed photo onto parts of the normally exposed photo optionally you can take a third over exposed photograph which you can use to fill in shadows in the same way smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 3 32 exposure_bracketing_celica_style_206 jpg 460px

bracketing a normal underexposed and overexposed photo parts of the darker photo can easily be digitally painted into the overexposed areas of the normal photo see in particular the headlight which is lacking detail in the normally exposed photograph remove any distractions from the vehicle just like you d remove distractions from a photograph of a person if you re at a car show wait for people to move out of your shot before taking it clear away any litter try not to shoot in front of a telephone pole which will make it look like the pole is poking out of the top of the car also try to avoid pulling too much sky into your photograph it ll more than likely blow out to a distracting bright cyan or white color if you re not using a gradual neutral density filter if you can choose an outdoor location shooting in front of buildings or other structures that will block out the sky is often a good idea get away from normal eye level try kneeling or standing on something to make yourself a couple feet taller or anything that helps you not to get the same eye level photos that everyone else will be taking 5 x research source instead try these 6 x research source kneel down in front of the car this will give it an aggressive coming at you appearance set the camera on the ground shooting the car from a very low angle and tilting it up slightly will give a unique view that isn t normally seen get close and specific find the more interesting or unique features or curves on the car then get close up shots of them from different angles take it from the top try to get a shot from high up or even just holding the camera high above your head this will both serve as a unique and interesting angle and allow the photo to capture multiple angles of the car side front top try shooting at night under artificial lighting you ll want a tripod for this one too and to either use a remote shutter release or a short self timer 7 x research source stop down to f 8 or f 11 this will turn bright points of light into multi pointed stars make sure your camera s automatic iso feature is off and shoot at the lowest iso setting your camera has look at the lighting on the vehicle artificial lighting will cast harsh shadows on parts of the car which will need to be filled with your own lighting you ll get used to these once you can remember that you can see much deeper into the shadows than your camera can get your flash off the camera if it has a built in flash then use a compact camera a camera phone or any old 1980s flash gun and quickly run around the vehicle firing the flash to fill in any shadows a longer exposure gives you plenty of time to do this which is another reason to stop down to f 8 or f 11 you might want to drop your photograph down to black and white when you re done artificial outdoor lighting especially sodium vapour is monochromatic enough that you will probably find that your image is almost black and white already once you remove the colour cast from your photograph a bonus is that this also means you won t have to worry about putting coloured filters over your flash to match the ambient artificial lighting take a variety of photos used car buyers will want to know as much about the vehicle as they can make sure the photos tell a story of your car five or more photos is the sweet spot 9 x research source try cropping really tightly and singling out a single instantly recognisable feature from the car this could be a taillight or a curve on the bodywork or a crop of quarter of the front grille with a headlight edit your photographs with your favourite photo editor if you don t have one get one gimp is free some tricks you might want to try are use layer masks on an underexposed version of the photo in order to paint in parts of it onto over exposed parts of your photo see the information exposure bracketing above fix the contrast more than likely you ll want to increase it one way which often works brilliantly for cars is to duplicate your image as a layer set the layer mode to soft light de saturate it then adjust the opacity of that layer to taste this also has the side effect of fixing colour casts 10 x

how to patent an invention,you ve created an invention that will revolutionize the way the world works but how do you make your idea a reality the united states patent and trademark office issues patents for original useful inventions that change the way people do things applying for a patent is a tedious and expensive process but if you know what to look for you ll be able to apply for a patent without hiring a professional follow the guide below to find out how to refine your invention and apply for a patent,understand what a patent is a patent rewards an inventor with certain exclusive legal rights for a limited time in exchange for a full disclosure of the invention which becomes public information a patent is represented by a document issued by a federal government upon a proper application after examination regarding a qualifying invention it includes one or more claims to a single invention as a rule patents are issued only to the first to file a disclosure of a patentable invention in a patent application also nobody is allowed to claim an invention they did not invent the owner of the patent is generally authorized to prevent others from making using selling or importing the invention within the jurisdiction after the patent is issued and until the patent lapses or expires those unlawful acts are known as patent infringement patent claims are also considered to include minor changes that are equivalent to any of the patented claims however a new means to obtain an equivalent result might still be patentable by you or others relatively few patents turn out to be valuable but yours could certainly be the exception you must decide whether to pursue the protection of a patent or perhaps obtain more value if you keep your invention a trade secret to enforce your patent you would need to take legal action against an infringer assuming the infringement occurs in a country where your patent is issued and remains valid and enforceable in some cases a patent claim can be ruled as void because it was issued improperly making it unenforceable there are also exceptions for certain limited uses of patented inventions by people who do not own the patent even without a license from the patent owners write down your idea the act of writing will force you to define your invention break down the invention into its elements and think about variations of the invention written materials produced as a result will also be helpful for preparing a patent application ask yourself these questions what problem does my invention solve how does my invention actually work who is my target audience how is my invention different from others like it is my invention new and non obvious in the current state of the art how much money will i need to produce my invention can i think of potential investors know who can apply for a patent patents can only be applied for in the name of the actual inventor s you can apply for a patent individually or as part of a joint research group in some cases an employer can file an application in the name of former employees who were the inventors understand what types of inventions can be patented there are three main types of patents utility design and plant that are granted for different types of inventions you can secure a utility patent for a process machine article of manufacture composition of matter i e a drug or an improvement upon any of these existing inventions though you will apply for a different type of patent you can also patent an ornamental design of an article of manufacture or an asexually reproduced plant variety in addition your invention must provide some utility to society must not be offensive to public standards of morality and must be novel non obvious adequately described or enabled and claimed by the inventor in clear and definite terms the requirements for new and non obvious are assessed in view of everything ever disclosed in a publication or used in public by anyone including you at any time prior to your filing date not just anything previously patented understand what cannot be patented there are several ideas or products of human labor that cannot be patented although many can be protected through other channels such as securing a copyright you cannot patent laws of nature physical phenomena abstract ideas literary dramatic musical and artistic works you need a copyright for these 1 x trustworthy source united states patent and trademark office u s government agency responsible for registering and protecting patents and trademarks go to source determine the type of patent you need to protect your invention apply for a utility patent for a product that has a specific clearly defined benefit to society most inventions fall into this category patent protection offered by a utility patent lasts for 20 years from the effective filing date of the patent apply for a design patent if you have an invention for a new improved design on an existing product or process that doesn t affect the function of the original product a design patent lasts 15 years from the date of the patent issuance if filed after may 13 2015 or 14 years if filed before that a plant patent is applicable if you develop a new asexually reproductive variety of plant protection for a plant patent exists for 20 years from the original patent application filing date determine whether your invention is new and non obvious by searching the literature in your field as well as patents in the usa and the rest of the world if your invention has already been disclosed by others or your invention is an obvious change to or combination of other inventions it is probably not patentable it may be possible that your invention is a patentable improvement over all previously known inventions even if you cannot quickly determine that if your invention is an improvement to an invention currently under protection of patents by others your patent search may help you understand whether you will need licenses from others before you can start making and selling your own version in their countries contact the nearest patent and trademark depository library ptdl and consult search experts patent searching is a difficult process because it requires that you perform several keyword searches and databases house all patents dating back to 1790 if you are in the washington d c area you can visit the uspto search facilities located in alexandria va enlist the help of a registered patent attorney or agent to help you conduct your search there are experts who know how to operate the patent system and efficiently find out whether or not your product is already patented alternately conduct a patent search online it will take you between 25 and 30 hours to complete a patent search in most cases think of all possible ways of describing your invention write a list of all the words you can possibly think of to adequately explain what your product does who it affects what problem s it solves etc having this list pre written will help you decide what terms to search for in the online database don t be afraid to be too broad in your terms look up the terms in the uspto online database visit http www uspto gov and select patent classification from the drop down patents tab on the left hand side of the page look under patent classification resources and click on the link that says classification index patents you are now in the uspto index select the category that most closely describes the broad classification that your invention falls under there will be subcategories under the broader category which you will need to make a second selection from choose the category that most narrowly describes your invention you may have to conduct several searches using different keywords that you brainstormed find your classification codes once you choose a subcategory there will be two numbers located to the right of the subcategory name separated by a forward slash the first number is the class and the second is the subclass take note of both of these numbers click on the subclass number this will take you to the specific subclass number page of the manual of classification look at the subclasses around the subclass you selected for similar categories to make sure that your browser is displaying all relevant subclasses choose expand all indent levels from the drop down menu at the top of the page click on submit and scroll back down to your subclass note that you are looking for subclasses that are physically displayed close to your chosen subclass not ones that are close in number to your subclass some original subclasses have been divided into smaller subclasses over time and thus have been shifted around and out of order understand that the dots to the left of the subclass titles are indicators of specificity the more dots the more specific a subclass will be dot numbers range from zero to seven click on the most appropriate subclass number doing so will take you to classification definitions where you can view more information about the subclass that you clicked on choose show definition view to view more information about a particular subclass and choose show schedule view to see a list of similar subclasses revisit the definition of the broad class and make sure it still aligns with the definition of your invention click on the red p icon to the left of the subclass number you will be taken to a list of all u s patents in that classification code which is most likely several thousand patents long the most recent patents will appear at the top of the page explore all of the patents to ensure that your invention is not already patented or otherwise disclosed in the references cited in the patents you can view a patent by clicking on the patent number located to the left of the patent title if issued after 1976 you can view the full text online if issued before 1976 you will have to view the patent with a tiff viewer examine the drawings and claims sections of each patent to quickly pick out similarities or differences between your invention and another write down the references that other patents cite to direct you to similar patents and related inventions perform a keyword search if you are having difficulty finding an appropriate subclass choose patent process from the drop down patent menu on the uspto homepage and click on the link called search for patents under searching full text patents since 1976 click on advanced search and type your keywords into the search box click on the patent number to view the full text decide whether you wish to file a provisional or a non provisional patent application the provisional application is associated with relatively inexpensive filing fees but serves merely to hold your place in line at the patent office for up to one year if you do not file a non provisional application within that year referencing your provisional application all your rights to your provisional application will be abandoned provisional applications do require a cover sheet and a filing fee after a provisional application is filed the inventor is allowed up to 12 months to file a non provisional application that references one or more provisional applications if the non provisional application is approved the invention is entitled to the inventor ship priority of the filing date of the provisional applications that disclose the claimed invention provisional applications do not require claims or an oath or declaration they simply allow the title patent pending to be associated with your invention provisional applications cannot be filed for design patent applications however the value of a provisional application is the ability to extend your ownership of the invention you disclose in the application prior to filing for an actual patent a complete disclosure is required in your provisional application if you want to later prove what you knew at the time nothing prevents you from filing additional provisional applications during the year if you discover valuable improvements along the way you can only claim the benefit in a non provisional for those provisional applications that have not yet expired at the time of filing the non provisional applications that reference them you may find informal discussions about getting a provisional patent but that is a misnomer a provisional application for a patent is not examined for patentability and does not become a patent with any enforceable rights it is a provisional application not a provisional patent employ a registered patent attorney or agent if you choose to hire someone to help prepare your patent application make sure that s he is uspto registered a registered patent attorney has proven a thorough knowledge of patent law and can ensure that you complete the patent application correctly alternately prepare your patent application yourself the patent application process is rather extensive and expensive you can file your application by mail or online to the director of the uspto as of november 15 2011 you can save almost 300 by applying online applications require six parts application transmittal form fee transmittal form visit http www uspto gov web offices ac qs ope fee031913 htm to find out what the current patent fees

declaration that the product was your original invention an oath must be certified before a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths a statutory declaration may be used in lieu of an oath and need not be certified by a third party it relies upon the fact that making a false declaration would be a felony note that as a rule the specification and drawings cannot be amended to add new matter during the prosecution of the application claims may be amended but only within the scope of what was disclosed in the original application and any cited provisional applications it is not unusual for an examiner to request amendment of a title or abstract for clarity make sure your documents are in the specified dimensions and written in english you can use any standard word processing program such as microsoft word and the documents can be in doc or pdf form if you need to scan drawings or diagrams they must be in pdf form make sure your documents contain at least a one inch left margin and a 3 4 inch right top and bottom margin all documents must be one and a half or double spaced if you do not include an information disclosure statement ids listing the references you found

be published 18 months after your filing date making it available for anyone in the world to see in particular if your application contains any trade secrets they will become public knowledge at that time during examination the examiner will typically ask for clarification of your invention or for a narrowing of the scope of protection sought in addition there is no guarantee that any application will eventually be granted as a patent the examination process will vary in duration depending on the nature of your invention and schedule of the patent office it is unusual for a non provisional patent application to result in a patent issuance without any interim rebuttal from the uspto you should expect it to be rejected perhaps for numerous reasons as part of the normal initial process do not consider this a setback you have a limited time in which to reply to each and every basis of objection or rejection and your application will go abandoned if you miss the deadline including any extensions that you are allowed to purchase during the patent pending phase of your application you may try to sell or exploit your invention without fear of losing any rights to the invention if you desire patent protection in other countries you have a limited time in which to file your patent applications in those countries and still claim invention priority of your us application your us patent pending does not prevent anyone from making using selling or importing your disclosed invention in the usa or any other country it is merely a warning you cannot sue for infringement of a patent that is not yet issued pay approval fees if your patent application is approved you will be sent a notice of allowance and fee s due pay the fees within three months from the date on the notice to avoid having your application abandoned receive your patent after the payments are received you will be issued your patent as soon as possible timing will depend on the amount of printing required and the workload of the uspto enjoy the the right to exclude others from making using offering for sale or selling the invention throughout the united states or importing the invention into the united states until your patent expires you may also find it more economical to license others to make or sell your invention for you rather than starting your own company however if you have proven the value of your invention by making a profit other investors may be more interested in acquiring your licenses if not the patent and your entire company with it patrol your industry for possible infringements of your patent because only you can decide whether to enforce your patents patent litigation can be very expensive continue to prosecute your patent applications in other countries based upon any amendments that were necessary for obtaining your us patent be sure to pay your maintenance fees to maintain a us patent in force you must pay fees due at 3 1 2 7 1 2 and 11 1 2 years from

how to sculpt,whether you re bringing out your inner michelangelo or want to make your own miniatures to really step up your d d sessions sculpting is a great hobby and very much a learned skill that does not require some kind of inherent artistic skill anyone can learn to sculpt there are many materials you can use for sculpting but the most common and easiest to teach and learn with is clay the instructions in this tutorial are directed specifically towards clay sculpting but the basic principles apply to many different types of sculpting warning always test techniques on test clay before using them in a final sculpture curing procedure should also be carefully tested to prevent burning,sketch your design you should always draw out your design before you start it doesn t have to be a good drawing but it does need to give you a solid road map for what you re going to do draw the sculpture from several different angles so that you can understand how different areas meet up the height at which different pieces need to be actual scale etc 1 x research source sketching the sculpture to scale can be extremely useful if it is very large don t sweat it but if you can draw the sculpture to scale do it build your armature armature is a fancy word sculptors use for support structure think of your armature as your sculpture s bones the armature is important as it will keep the piece from becoming too delicate and easily broken 2 x research source usually the armature is made from wire the gauge of which will depend on the size of your sculpture you can use other materials though if your sculpture is small or wire is unavailable toothpicks can work as can sticks for larger sculptures pvc pipe or plumping pipes can be useful using your sketch identify the main pieces of the sculpture look at the lines that define those pieces and how they connect to the other pieces again imagine a skeleton form your armature to these lines add your filler the filler is a bit like the muscles of your sculpture generally it s made out of a cheap light weight plentiful material it s important because it will help you save on materials costs as well as keep down the weight of your sculpture making it less prone to breaking and easier to move common filler materials include masking or painter s tape tin foil newspaper or cheaper clay not encouraged start with large sections once your armature and filler material are in place you can start adding your sculpting material for the purposes of this tutorial we re using polymer clay super sculpey or similar start with getting the broadest strokes in terms of the shape you just want the foundation to work with if you re sculpting an organic creature such as a person or an animal then it s best to make these chunks resemble the large muscle groups for that creature 3 x research source add smaller sections begin to more carefully define the shape of your sculpture you should still be adding clay or other sculpting material at this point these additions should like the larger chunks define the general shape of the sculpture but cover the smaller areas in the example of the organic creature these would be the small muscle groups but also additional items like the basic forms of long hair not things like fur sculpt finer details with the basic form in place you can begin to take your material away or shift it into place this is the sculpting stage in the traditional sense move and smooth larger pieces into their final shape and begin to carve out smaller details the angle of a cheek bone the knuckles of a hand etc for the previous two steps you will largely be relying on your hands unless your sculpture is very small for this step however you may need to begin to use some tools you can use sculpture tools or you can improvise tools see the section below for a longer discussion of tools identify the necessary textures look over your sculpture and think about the different materials that would make up that object in real life flesh hair fabric stone grass fur etc on your original sketch or on an entirely new one map out what textures go where do some research look at lots of pictures of those types of textures to figure out how they work you d be surprised how complex it can be fur for example grows in chunks and you ll have to pay attention to the length organization and direction of every chunk texture the areas begin to texture your sculpture one section at a time using traditional or improvised tools only a very limited number of sculpting tools are needed and most can be improvised from common household objects you will have to experiment to find out what works best for you as almost every sculptor uses their tools differently 4 x research source generally with sculpting tools large tips are used to create the broad details while finer tips are used to create details scoop like tools create rounded areas tools with a loop are used to scrape away the material anything with a sharp edge can be used to cut tools can be improvised from balls of tin foil black peppercorn toothpicks x acto knives a toothbrush a steel ball chain necklace a comb knitting needles crochet hooks large and small sewing needles cookie cutters melon ballers etc cure your sculpture once you re done with all of the major clay work you ll need to cure your sculpture to make it hard if you want it hard if not ignore different clays need to be cured in different ways air dry bake etc so follow the manufacturer s instructions for the clay you use it is generally better to under bake use a low temperature for longer periods of time if you can to avoid burning paint your sculpture if you want your sculpture to have color and your sculpting material was not itself colored you may want to paint your sculpture what type of paints you use will depend on what type of material you used but for most materials you want to use some type of acrylic paint model enamel paints will be necessary or at least recommended if using polymer clays 5 x research source prepare the sculpture for painting by washing it with soap and water or giving it a quick wipe down with some rubbing alcohol if your paint goes down very streaky a base coat or multiple coats may be necessary add gloss if desired glosses and glazes can be used to make areas that should look wet like eyes or open mouths more realistic use an appropriate gloss or glaze for whatever material you are working with a good basic option is modge podge mix media as necessary to create an even more realistic look you can mix media as needed to get the look you want this can mean using real hair for a sculpture of a person real fabric for clothes or actual dirt rocks or moss for your sculpture s base,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to sculpt a face,sculpting a face can be a challenge for the beginning sculptor but there are a few simple tricks that will make it easy it just takes some simple techniques and proper placement of the facial features so find a subject you want to sculpt grab a few tools to help you add detail and start sculpting,choose your clay you have several options when choosing a modelling clay to sculpt your face each clay is different so choose the clay that best suits your purposes 1 x research source ceramic clays are water based and easy to work with right out of the bag it needs to stay moist while being worked as it can dry out and crack ceramic clay can also be fire hardened to make a permanent sculpture 2 x expert source natasha dikareva mfa ceramics sculpting instructor expert interview 5 may 2020 plasteline clay is an oil based clay that doesn t dry out and can t be fire hardened it is popular with special effects crews for its ability to hold high levels of detail 3 x research source polymer clays require an armature or a wire skeleton for support they are weaker than other clays but are good for painting polymer clays can be fire hardened though they are not as hard as ceramic clays 4 x research source gather supplies aside from the clay you ll need a few other things before you can start sculpting a good clean working area is necessary as are a few tools to help you add detail to your sculpture you can buy sculpting tools from most craft stores you don t have to buy specialized tools for sculpting it may be possible to find other utensils that serve the same purpose the main functions of your tools are to cut scrape and shape the clay you can use sewing needles to draw fine lines in your clay and add detail 5 x research source study your subject if you know the person whose face you are sculpting take pictures of them from all angles try to get some good straight shots of your subject looking straight at the camera take some from the side as well to get a good profile 6 x research source if you re basing your sculpture on a famous person find photos on the internet and print them out make sure you have a variety of angles to get a good idea of the person s proportions 7 x research source it may help to draw some grid lines on some of your photos to help you see the relationship between facial features 8 x research source sketch your design think about how you want the person to look in your sculpture think about who they are what they do and why you want to sculpt them use these questions to add emotion to your sculpture do a rough drawing of different expressions to get some ideas for how you want your sculpture to look 9 x research source the drawing doesn t have to be perfect it s just a tool to help you plot out your sculpture form a ball roll out an oval and smooth the clay the smoother you can make your clay in the beginning the easier it will be to form your face depending on the size of your sculpture it may be difficult to roll out a ball if you re making a small sculpture it shouldn t be a problem however if you re making a larger sculpture you may need to sculpt out a neck as well 10 x research source keep in mind the proportions of your subject as you form the oval you ll be adding clay to make the other facial features but the oval should resemble the basic shape of your subject s head 11 x research source try making a clay silhouette an alternate method to making the basic shape of a face is to create a silhouette based on your subject s profile when using this method it can be helpful to start from the bottom of the silhouette and work your way up 12 x expert source natasha dikareva mfa ceramics sculpting instructor expert interview 5 may 2020 print out a profile photo of your subject make sure the photo is the size you want your sculpture to be 13 x research source roll out some clay about as wide as you d like the nose on your sculpture to be lay it flat on a clean surface make sure you have enough clay make a full profile 14 x research source take the profile cut out and lay it on your slab of clay trace the profile onto the clay and cut away any excess clay 15 x research source this should leave you with a slab of clay that is a silhouette of your subject start adding some clay to thicken the neck so you can stand your sculpture up as you add width to form the face 16 x research source add guidelines to mark out proportions using a needle or a rubber tipped tool draw a fine vertical line down the middle of the face this is your line of symmetry draw a horizontal line halfway down your line of symmetry to mark where the eyes will be halfway between the eye line and the bottom of the face make a second horizontal line this is where you will place the nose make one last line halfway between the nose line and the bottom of the face to mark where the mouth will go form the eyes using a small spoon or rounded tool start forming the eye sockets just under the eye line take care not to gouge the clay work carefully and take your time try to keep your tool flat on the clay and use small circular movements smooth the clay out as you work the sockets should be deep enough so that the eyes do not protrude from the sculpture add brow bones by rolling two small cylinders of clay and attaching them just above the eye sockets make sure the clay is workable so you can blend it onto the face using a small spatula slowly work the brow bone into the forehead creating a small ridge work until you can t see any creases between the forehead and the brow bone form eyelids in much the same way as you made brow bones take two small cylinders of clay and place them just under the brow bone and into the eye sockets smooth out any seam lines to blend the eyelids into the rest of the face repeat the process to form the bottom eyelids roll small balls of clay to place into the eye sockets to act as the eyes round off the ball and form each eye in its socket try to keep the eyes symmetrical as you form them make a nose form a pyramid from a separate piece of clay and attach it between the eyes blend the clay into the face paying special attention to the bridge of the nose the bridge should blend evenly with the brow bones as you make the nose check the profile of your sculpture some noses stick out further than others and some turn up slightly refer to your photo reference to make sure you get the nose just right the shape of a nose lends character to a face play around with different types of noses to see what effects you can create hollow out the mouth area to make a mouth on your sculpture scoop out a little clay below the nose only take enough clay to form the inside of the mouth you ll be adding lips to your face with separate pieces of clay using the same technique as you did to form the brow bone and the nose add some clay to form the lips roll out a small cylinder and blend it into the face to form the upper lip forming a mouth takes a lot of practice keep referring to your photo reference and don t be afraid to start over if you need to to form the bottom lip leave some excess clay from the upper lip and bend it down forming a horseshoe shape roll another cylinder of clay and attach it beneath the upper lip leave a little space between the two lips to make it appear as though the mouth is slightly open blend the clay until all the seams are gone fill out the face once you ve added eyes a nose and a mouth you might need to go back and build out the rest of the face add clay to make a chin cheeks hair or even bulk up the forehead if you need to when adding clay to your face make sure you keep blending to make a seamless sculpture it helps to work the clay a little to warm it up this way it s easier to mold when you add it add ears by making small flat circles and attaching them to the side of the face keep the earlobe above the jawline and connect the top part of the ear on the same path as the eye line sculpt the details of the ear with a small spatula or needle fix any mistakes before you finish your sculpture compare it to your photo reference if you find anything you aren t happy with go back and re work it stay patient and think of your mistakes as opportunities to improve your skill once you re happy with everything do a final blending pass over your sculpted face smooth out any seams remove any excess clay and clean up the sculpture add any finishing touches depending on the clay you used you can either bake it off to finish your sculpture or form a mold feel free to paint your sculpture or add decorations to bring your art to life,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to use a shortwave radio,shortwave radio also known as high frequency hf radio is considered by some to be the first internet shortwave 3 30mhz signals travel great distances especially at night and can be tuned to listen to broadcasts originating in other countries earning shortwave radio the nickname of world band radio sound quality can vary greatly but is largely intelligible in just a little time you too can become a swl a shortwave listener,compare radio features and quality by going to a store that has a selection of short wave radios from which to listen analog shortwave can be found at 30 70 and well beyond amplitude modulation am is a common mode for broadcasters but there is also single side band ssb mode an ssb radio will receive both ssb and am modes but an am only mode radio will not allow intelligible ssb monitoring digital tuners sometimes called pll or phase locked loop are more expensive but make it easy to precisely tune and lock on a particular frequency drift is virtually eliminated these tuners can also easily scan and memorize frequencies however many inexpensive digital tuners present the listener with chopping sounds or automatic muting while tuning that analog tuners do not exhibit this would only be a problem when attempting to scan shortwave bands for content not when there is a specific frequency that you wish to tune see tips upgrade to a larger and or external antenna to improve reception google swl antenna for ready to install types from manufacturers or make your own nearly anything will be better than just the telescopic rod type antenna included with the radio adding long length of wire clamped to the rod antenna with a simple alligator clip can work wonders move the wire around to find the optimum location for best reception become familiar with shortwave bands there are multiple shortwave bands named 25 meters 31 meters 49 meters etc each band encompasses a specific frequency range some radios show frequency in megahertz mhz and other in kilohertz khz you may need to consult your radio s manual in order to find out how to get into specific bands generally most bands have the clearest signals at sunrise and sunset although some are better at night and others are better during the day see sources below scan the shortwave bands and find content hit or miss annual publications like world radio tv handbook and passport to world band radio provide frequencies and schedules of broadcasters there are websites that will tell you which broadcaster is using the frequency 1 x research source as well as provide a schedule of english language shortwave broadcast 2 x research source some people look for certain kinds of content foreign stations this pursuit is often referred to as dxing dx is the telegraphic shorthand for distant specialized shortwave utility or ute transmissions e g maritime naval aviation or military signals numbers stations broadcasts of voices reading in unidentified code the origin is uncertain and the purpose is suspected by many to be espionage interactive communication between amateur radio operators request and collect qsl cards by sending an swl short wave listener reception report to a broadcaster this is optional but many shortwave listeners enjoy collecting qsls as keepsakes and you provide the broadcaster with valuable feedback and information to put together an swl reception report you ll need to record the following information when and how the station identifies itself the name of the program content of the news or other program names of the announcer s items unique to the locality of the station how well the signal was received using the sinpo code signal refers to the strength of the signal received interference indicates whether other stations were interfering with the signal noise identifies the presence of atmospheric or other noise on the frequency propagation refers to the fading characteristics of the signal overall tells the station how well you received their signal,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to develop a product,the difference between successful products and bad inventions happens in product development lots of inventors have good ideas but the ability to transition those ideas from flashes of brilliance to salable products that s innovation you can learn to design your product into something that will sell organize testing to keep yourself in business and develop into a successful enterprise,identify a consumer need the difference between failed products and hot sellers is need as an aspiring entrepreneur and innovator your goal is to create something that people don t even know they need what s missing from the marketplace what do people want there s no easy way to answer this question or we d all be millionaires keep an idea notebook with you at all times and try to keep track of times when you re frustrated with something small and inspiration strikes maybe you re lying on your back in the sun and having trouble holding up your book what simple product might address your need 1 x research source while it might seem like an effective shortcut polling consumers about what they d like in terms of particular products tends not to pan out again if people knew what great products they wanted we d all be millionaires collaborate with designers coming up with the concept of the hoverboard is great and all but you ve also got to actually design the thing depending on your engineering abilities you may need to collaborate with engineers and designers to come up with a workable prototype of your idea write out your vision for the product as you see it but also be willing to compromise when you come up against the practical concerns maybe hoverboard technology is a little complex at this point but you find a guy with experience designing immersive video game technology hoverboard 3d alternatively try designing products yourself the designer of the revolight an innovative bicycle lighting system designed the prototype himself in the garage and it made serious money on the internet pick up the skills you don t have and try it yourself come up with multiple options a good innovator comes up with a great product to fulfill a consumer need a great innovator comes up with five try to examine the issue that you re trying to fill from lots of different directions thinking about as many alternative ways of getting around the issue as possible don t be satisfied with one model to work with try to come up with more if that model should fail again think about the product in terms of need if you ve got a problem reading your book in the sun you might automatically think of a little chest prop for your book but what about eye protection designed for reading what about digital alternatives what about keeping the pages free of sand get the funding necessary to make a prototype one excellent way of securing funding to create prototypes for expensive products to present to investors or to go into full scale production mode for yourself is to secure funding via crowdsourcing kickstarter gofundme and other crowdsourcing websites can be excellent methods of getting the start up cash necessary to get your product off the ground however remember that some of the crowdfunding platforms require a functional prototype to be made before starting a campaign building a prototype is not a small or simple task especially if your product requires mechanisms electronics or firmware to function consider hiring a product development team that would produce a fully functional and neat prototype that would impress your backers and investors if you ve got a good history of developing products you might think about taking your product design to venture capitalists and gaining some money on the basis of your track record create a prototype once you ve come up with a few good ideas and collaborated on designs with your designer or small team of designers get a working prototype together and start testing it out depending on the nature of the product this might take a while or you might be able to get it together relatively quickly when you do you re ready to start developing and testing use the product yourself since you re the one with the idea for the product in the first place you ll be the first line of testing try out your product on your own and see how it works keep track of little frustrations elements of the product in need of tweaking and spend a good deal of time using and thinking about the product you re testing as you use the product keep a journal or a voice recorder with you to keep track of your experience of the product as you re using it you might tend to remember all the bad or all the good later on don t just use the product abuse it if you re thinking about going into production you ll want to find out what your product is made of and whether or not it ll stand up to people throwing it around dropping it and the other trappings of real life ownership is it fragile could it use some reinforcing find an audience this is one of the most important parts of developing a product who s going to buy what you re selling who like you will have experienced the same frustration or desire that this product will fulfill how will you reach that audience the next step of your process will be getting other people to use your product and give you feedback so you want to define your audience as specifically as possible in terms of several criteria 2 x research source age range socio economic status level of education hobbies and interests prejudices and opinions do a series of test trials bring your product to a group of people let them try it and give them the opportunity to provide feedback this could be as informal as giving a few cases of your home brew to your friends and family and listening to them review it or as formal as doing a serious focus group session with a series of different test groups 3 x research source if you want to do an informal feedback session treat it as seriously as the product warrants your parents and your friends will likely tell you that your new beer is delicious to be nice but also give it to some serious beer drinkers to find out whether or not you ve got the stuff if you conduct formal focus groups do several runs with different groups of people your audience may be slightly different than you originally anticipated listen and gather feedback gather criticism as you give your product out and introduce it to unfamiliar users start collecting first hand feedback write up surveys conduct interviews and listen closely to the feedback given often the difference between products that catch on and products that fall by the wayside is the ability of the inventors to incorporate feedback into product development 4 x research source in some cases you might find it more effective to allow someone else to gather feedback about your product from testers you may be inclined to defend your product against criticism whereas a more unbiased researched will have an easier time collecting this feedback revise the product steve jobs wasn t a renowned inventor he was a genius tweaker the best products aren t usually the result of great leaps forward but of little changes that make a good innovation or concept into a great product that you can sell incorporate the feedback you receive about your product into tweaks and revisions that will take it from good to great the feedback you gather will likely not have great ideas about ways in which the product needs to be changed but you can listen to the criticism that occurs and come up with your own ideas about how to address those complaints so people found your book prop somewhat complicated to use how can it be easier come up with an operational budget before you secure funding to get your business off the ground you ll need to come up with an operational budget 5 x research source when you ve got your product in place what will you need to grow your business and go into operation what will you need to maintain a functioning enterprise you ll likely need to consider all of the following cost of operation overhead outside expenses worker salaries write up a marketing plan for your product once you ve got your product in place you need to figure out a strategy for marketing that product to investors and eventually to customers what is your selling point what s your thing the more you can decide about your marketing strategy before turning to an agency the better the best products can be sold on the strength of their usefulness and integrity good products sell themselves present your product to investors going into production will take some start up cash the way to secure this is to present your new product to investors who will put up the cash to back your product and get you on your feet the closer you are to a well rounded and fully teased out idea and working model the closer you ll be to securing this capital and getting your business started develop the criteria for quality control once you secure capital and start going into business for yourself you ll have a lot of manufacturing concerns to take care of depending on the product that you re trying to sell the one thing you need to be sure to keep ahead of from a product development point of view is the control of quality what standards to you have for the

how to photograph the eye close up,close up photographs of the eye are among the most stunning images that exist the intricate patterns of iris look like an ethereal otherworldly landscape with the right perspective lens and lighting you too can snap a phenomenal close up photo of the eye,have your subject look at the lens or other fixed point having your subject look directly at the camera lens will help you take a detailed photo of their iris and pupil if you want to capture the eye from a different perspective have your subject look at a fixed point so you can find the best angle from which to take the shot 1 x research source examine the eye closely and decide what most interests you are you drawn to the colors and patterns of the iris or the reflection of the light on the pupil do you want to focus on the wrinkles around the eye or the curvature of the eyelashes your answer to this question will be the main detail you focus on when taking your shot 2 x research source produce a catch light with a continuous light source a catch light is the small white spot you sometimes see in close up photographs of the eye you can create a catch light by setting up a stable continuous source of light you can use a softbox an umbrella a ring light or natural light to create this effect 3 x research source make sure that your camera isn t casting a shadow over your shot get as close as you can to the eye many close up shots of the eye don t turn out for the simple reason that the photographer didn t get close enough to the eye position your camera s lens as close your subject as it can be without your shot going blurry 4 x research source be careful not to block the light you need for your shot use your camera s zoom to hone in on the eye adjust your zoom until you find a viewpoint you like widening your shot to include other detail can provide some context but may take away from the detail you ve chosen to focus on 5 x research source keep your camera steady with a tripod or other sturdy surface when taking a close up shot the slightest shake of your hand can blur your photo using a tripod or other surface to support your camera as you take your photo will help prevent this from happening 6 x research source set up a mirror behind your camera to take a photo of your own eye if you want to take a macro photograph of your own eye a camera with flip screen is the best option because it will allow you to easily see whether your shot is on target and in focus if your camera doesn t have a flip screen however placing a small mirror behind your camera will also give you a view of the display screen 7 x research source if you re taking a photo of your own eye with a cellphone you ll also want to use a mirror this is because taking a photo of your eye on the selfie setting of your phone will affect the lighting of your shot put a macro lens on your camera a macro lens will allow you to best capture the detail of the eye macro lenses vary in focal length from 50 to 200mm you can still take a good close up photo of the eye with a regular lens but you may not be able to get the eye to fill the entire frame or capture all the detail you want 8 x research source if you don t have a macro lens and don t want to spend the money to get one try using a close up filter as an alternative 9 x research source use a macro mode or macro lens attachment when using a cellphone many cellphones have a macro mode which will allow you to take a more detailed photograph of the eye than with your camera s standard settings a macro lens attachment for your cellphone will produce even more detailed shots 10 x research source you can find a macro lens attachment for your cellphone at most major retailers and electronics stores if you re planning to buy a macro lens attachment make sure you choose one that fits your phone model consider adding an extension tube to make the lens focus closer extension tubes fit between the rear mount of the lens and the camera body using an extension tube will magnify the eye in your shot allowing you to capture more intricate details 11 x research source make your camera s aperture smaller for a shallower depth of field for a close up shot the best depth of field is shallow set your camera to camera s aperture number to between f 5 6 and f 11 12 x research source the aperture number you choose will depend on what details of the eye you want to highlight in your photograph play around with the aperture to see how the aperture setting changes your shots use a fast shutter speed to eliminate blurriness the eye is constantly moving which can blur your shot for a sharper image set your shutter speed to at 1 100th of a second or faster 13 x research source using a tripod will also allow you to set a higher shutter speed lower your iso value to prevent digital grain increasing your iso value allows you to take photographs in low light conditions but will make your photo grainy if you re taking your photo in a well lit area keep your iso value as low as possible 14 x research source focus your lens manually autofocus may not focus on the details you want to focus on so it is best to just turn it off and focus the shot yourself to manually focus your lens turn your focus ring so that everything is out of focus then turn it back the other way until the details you want to highlight in your shot are in focus 15 x research source turn off your camera s flash avoid using your camera s flash or shining other bright lights at your subject s eyes bright light can damage their eyes and can cause your subject to squint interfering with your photograph 16 x research source take lots of photos to capture the perfect shot it s impossible to know what combination of viewpoint composition focus and depth of field will produce the best shot so try as many combinations as you can when taking a close up shot the small changes you make can give you very different photos 17 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to restore old photographs,printed photographs are delicate items that capture valuable memories and moments in history oftentimes older images are one of a kind so it can be particularly heartbreaking to discover that they have been damaged photographs can incur a lot of damage through years of exposure to humidity water sunlight and dirt sometimes even storing new photographs incorrectly can result in damage knowing your options for restoring photographs learning how to repair them at home and properly storing photos afterwards can help ensure the longevity of your photographs for generations to come,get the right equipment for digital restoration purchasing a high quality scanner and photo editing software for your home computer can help make digital restoration at home possible invest in a photo editing program like photoshop and a high quality scanner that can scan images at a high dpi or dots per square inch the greater the dpi the more detail the scanner will be able to capture a dpi of 300 is recommended for most photographs scan the photograph gently place the photograph in the scanner and select to scan the image at a high resolution to capture as much detail as possible when prompted save the image as a tiff instead of a jpeg a tiff is a larger file but it will retain the detail and quality of the photograph 1 x research source once you have saved the image open it in your photo editing software crop the image use the cropping tool to remove any evidence of damage around the edges of the photograph edges of old photographs often curl when exposed to water or humidity if your photograph has damage around the perimeter cropping the image will quickly correct this problem correct the photograph s tone repair the color brightness and contrast issues before attempting to change any other imperfections or signs of damage these can be adjusted by opening editing tools in photoshop or another photo editing software these levels can be altered by sliding your cursor along a scale until you produce your desired effects increasing the brightness level can help brighten up a dark photo or intensifying the contrast can bring out a washed out faded photo play with the color sliders to help remove unwanted tints save each version you create under a different file name so you can compare each version later and select the best restoration fix scratches and dust marks using the dust and scratches filter or the spot healing brush in photoshop or a similar tool in other photo editing programs makes removing imperfections straightforward and simple 2 x research source magnify the photograph and use the cursor to touch up the damaged marks work slowly and be sure to zoom out to check your progress as you work this filter works by removing some of the details so you will want to be sure that you are not overusing this feature keep a window open of the whole photo so you can observe the changes as you make them fill in tears or missing portions if there are tears rips or missing sections of the photograph you can use the clone stamp tool to recreate a portion of the image and fill in the damaged sections after opening the tool select the potion of the photo that you would like to clone or recreate and click it once move the cursor to the area you would like to repair with the material you just copied print the image after you have restored the photograph use an inkjet printer or a special photo printer with glossy paper to print out your restored photograph clean your photographs if your old photograph has dirt sand or residue on it you may be able to clean the image by hand wear rubber gloves and gently remove the dirt with a soft brush or soft bristled toothbrush if there is a large amount of dirt the photograph can be gently rinsed under lukewarm running water use your finger to softly wipe away dirt but take care not scratch the photo let the photograph dry in a dark place where it will not be disturbed you can clip the image on a wire with a clothespin to dry or you can place the image face up on a newspaper or towel 3 x research source if the photo turns red yellow or white while cleaning this could be an indication that professional care is needed the image may be too badly damaged to fix at home use water to separate photographs that are stuck together if you find a stack of photographs that have stuck together do not pull them apart instead soak them in distilled water photographs are coated with gelatin when they are placed in water the gelatin softens and the photographs can be separated more easily 4 x research source purchase a bottle of distilled water from your local grocery store or pharmacy keep the water at room temperature and pour it into a container that is large enough to submerge your photos place them with the image facing upward and let them soak in the water for 20 to 30 minutes use your fingers to gently slide the photographs apart or use a rubber spatula to separate the images let them dry on a towel image side up place a book or magazine along the edges so they do not curl as they dry 5 x research source remove photos that are stuck to glass with heat before trying to remove the glass be sure you make a copy of the image you can remove the glass by heating up the image hold a hair dryer 4 to 5 inches away from the back of a print after a few minutes try to lift up one of the corners of the image and slowly peel back the image 6 x research source fix a tear with acid free tape you can secure a tear or fix a torn photograph by using an acid free tape regular tape with an acidic adhesive can damage the photograph over time look for an archival tape or tape with an acrylic adhesive at an office supply or stationary store to repair and protect your photographs cut small pieces of tape and secure the tear on the back of the photograph use a mending strip to fix a torn photograph a torn photograph can also be repaired by using a strip of acid free paper that is secured with acid free glue these can be purchased at an arts and crafts store or an office supply shop apply a small amount of the glue to the strip of paper and press the strip over the tear on the back of the photograph remove any excessive glue with a cotton swab let the image dry face down on a towel and place a weight like a small book on top of the image to prevent the edges from curling create a humidification chamber for photographs with curled edges if you have an old photograph that was rolled up or if the edges are curling you can release the curls by placing the photo in a homemade humidification chamber this chamber will reintroduce water into the dry brittle photograph which will allow the curled edges to relax and release fill a plastic storage bin with a couple of inches of room temperature water place a wire rack in the container making sure that the top is not submerged place the photo on top of the rack and close the chamber with the lid let it sit for several hours check on the photograph periodically and wipe away any beads of water on the photo after a few hours if the curls have relaxed remove the photograph and let it dry face up on a towel cover the image with blotting paper or parchment paper and weigh the photograph down with a book as it dries seek the help of a professional if the photograph is heavily damaged very old or extremely delicate consider having the photo professionally restored professionals can not only restore photographs that have been ripped stained or damaged by water or sunlight but they can also digitally enhance the photo s overall quality and color many services are available online a professional will assess your photo and offer you a quote depending on the damage and the amount of work required 7 x research source most professional services will work from a digital copy of the photograph leaving the original untouched and safe the restored photo and the original image will be returned to you store photos in a climate controlled environment photographs can be damaged from exposure to water sunlight heat and moisture in the air humidity can cause photographs to stick together while high temperatures cause photographs to become very brittle store your photographs in an environment that has low humidity is not exposed to direct sunlight and does not experience extreme temperature fluctuations ideally the temperature should be below 75 fahrenheit 8 x research source do not store photos in a hot attic or in a garage or basement where the images may come into contact with water keep your photographs in a temperature controlled section of the house like a bedroom or hallway closet keep photos in archival boxes and albums archival boxes and albums provide a safe environment for your photographs that keep out humidity pests and dust you can find these items from online vendors and from a stationery or office supply shop when browsing for archival boxes or albums be sure that they are intended for photo storage and are free from acid and pvc or polyvinyl chloride 9 x research source place a silica gel packet in the box to help offset any excess moisture properly store the photographs in a bin or album if an album or storage box is packed to the brim with photos it may not close properly leaving the photos susceptible to environmental damage a box that is not filled enough may also cause damage to the photographs when there are only a few items in the container the images may slide around causing damage to the edges be sure that the photographs are secure and that the storage bin can properly close 10 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build an antweight combat robot,have you ever wanted to build a combat robot you probably thought it was too dangerous and expensive however a lot of combat robot competitions have a weight class for 150 grams including robot wars this class is called antweight in most countries and fairy weight in the usa these are a whole lot cheaper than the bigger combat robots and aren t as dangerous this makes them perfect for people new to combat robots this article will tell you how to design and build an antweight combat robot note this article assumes that you have already read and built an easy rc robot if you have not go back and do that first it should also be noted that this article does not recommend a specific part for use with your robot this is to promote creativity and diversity amongst robots,understand the rules before designing a robot to compete you must understand all the rules the rules can be found here the most important building rules that you need to be paying attention to are the size weight requirements 4 x4 x4 150 grams and the metal armor rule that says you cannot have metal armor more the 1mm thick what weapon will you use a big part of the combat robot is the weapon think up an idea for a weapon but make sure it fits within the rules for your first antweight bot it s highly recommended going with a flipper or even a pusher a flipper is just a weapon that wedges itself underneath another robot and pushes up to flip them over a flipper weapon when designed properly can be the most effective weapon in the antweight class a pusher is the simplest weapon because there is no active weapon the whole robot acts as a weapon by pushing the other robots around this is effective because of the rule that states that half of the arena can t be walled you can push the other robot out of the arena choose your parts yes you need to choose your parts before designing however don t buy them yet just choose your parts and design accordingly if something doesn t fit or doesn t work while you are still designing you save money because you can switch parts now again do not buy the parts yet choose drive servos it s usually recommended using servos instead of motors for an beginner s antweight because with servos you do not need a speed controller which saves money and precious weight on your robot you should look for micro servos because they will save you a lot of weight be sure to make sure the servo is 360 modifiable it s recommended getting high torque servos for combat robots instead of high speed so it s easy to push other robots around even if you have a separate weapon servos can be purchased here if you cannot find a servo that suits your needs perfectly consider checking out another section on that site that sells futaba servos futaba is a different brand that makes servos sometimes they have different sizes than the hitech brand choose a weapon motor if you have an active weapon i e aren t creating a pusher then you probably need a motor to move the weapon if you have a weapon that needs to move really fast i e a spinning weapon then you should get a geared dc motor brushless generally works better but brushed would work with a speed controller it s not recommended using a spinning weapon for your first antweight because they can be difficult to build and balance properly however if you are creating a flipper weapon then you want to use a servo it s recommended to get a micro servo with extremely high torque so it can flip other robots with ease another thing to consider when looking for a weapon servo is the type of gears if you use nylon gears and the motor gets a lot of stress the gears can strip out over time try getting stronger gears made out of metal choose wheels when choosing wheels be sure to remember the rule that says the robot has to be able to fit within a 4 x4 x4 cube this means you have to have wheels that have a diameter less than this it s recommended to use 2 diameter wheel be sure that the wheels can easily attach to the servos securely another great technique to use in combat robots of any size is the ability to drive upside down yes the controls will be a bit backwards but it can prevent you from losing the competition from being immobile so consider making your robot shorter than your wheels so that it can drive upside down you can purchase wheels here choose a transmitter receiver when purchasing a receiver make sure that it has what is called fail safe operation it is a rule to have this in most competitions and a safety feature the ar500 receiver does not have this you will need to purchase a br6000 bot receiver or another receiver that has this feature for a transmitter it s recommended using the spektrum dx5e if you built the remote controlled robot found in the related wikihows you can reuse that transmitter but you must buy a new receiver choose a battery it s highly recommended getting a lipo battery instead of a nimh battery lipo batteries are lighter however they are more dangerous expensive and require a special charger invest the money into a lipo battery and a charger to save on the precious weight choose a material the material the chassis and armor is made out of on a combat robot is extremely important because it is what prevents enemy weapons from piercing your electric components there are three main choices that you should choose from note there are more but these are the best for this particular weight class aluminum titanium and polycarbonate aluminum is light weight and strong but it can be expensive and hard to cut plus it can not be more than 1mm at all titanium is light weight and extremely strong but is hard to cut and extremely expensive this also is subject to the 1 mm thickness rule polycarbonate or lexan is a lightweight inexpensive easy to cut shatterproof strong plastic that is sometimes used in bullet proofing polycarbonate is also a plastic so it can be as thick as you want but it s recommended to get it about 1 mm thick it s highly recommended using polycarbonate it s so durable that this plastic is the plastic that makes up the arena walls for antweight competitions when you purchase it be sure to get extra in case you mess up get specifications now that you have all your parts selected you need to get size and weight specs they should be listed on the website

using a converter write the weight specs on a piece of paper design it out you want the design to be as precise as possible this means you should try your best to make the design 3d on a computer rather than 2d on a sheet of paper however the 3d design doesn t need to look complex a simple one made of rectangular prisms and cylinders will be sufficient add up the weight of the parts in grams and be sure they total less than 150 grams if you don t have cad download the free version of sketchup take some of the free tutorials on sketchup to learn all the basics create all the components you

how to make a projector screen,going to the movies and seeing your favorite films on the big screen can be a lot of fun however you might not always feel like visiting the theater or maybe you want to host your own movie nights building your own projection screen can be a great way to enjoy the big screen experience in the comfort of your own home with family and friends,get the big picture before you set out to create a painted projector screen it can be helpful to have an understanding of the whole project knowing what to expect can help you get the right materials and assemble them properly when you move onto those stages check out the following overview to get a good grasp on the project 1 x research source buy paint for both the wall and the screen paint your wall entirely paint the screen add a frame find the right paint since the main surface of this projector screen will be a painted surface it is critical that you get the right type of paint using the wrong type of paint can result in reduced or altered image quality make sure your paint will work well for the screen you are building before proceeding 2 x research source sherwin williams proclassic smooth enamel satin extra white b20 w 51 is recommended paint the wall once you have your paint ready you can begin painting however you won t be painting the exact area of the screen just yet before you paint the screen it can be a good idea to paint the entire wall this can help give contrast to the screen making it stand out and prevent any paint from dripping on the screen itself 3 x research source turn on your projector and position it to where you want the image to be on the wall mark off the inside area of where your projected image will be paint the wall around this border leaving the screen area for later try to use a paint that is non reflective and darker than your screen paint paint the screen after your walls have been painted you can begin painting your the screen itself take your time and make sure everything is where you want it before you begin creating the screen keep some of the following tips in mind as you paint your screen 4 x research source move your tape to the outside border of your screen sand the area and make sure the wall surface is flat and free of any holes cracks or bumps apply primer and let it dry apply your first coat of paint use a small paint roller for the best results once you ve got a smooth and dry first coat you can add another to finish add a simple frame to finish your screen you may want to add a simple black frame the easiest way to add a frame to your painted screen is to use black velvet tape the frame will help make your screen look completed and can also help improve picture quality as well 5 x research source add a strip of black velvet tape to each edge of the screen make sure the tape runs evenly and that your frame is level and straight check that the tape is laying smooth and flat against the wall find a good wall space before you can get started building your projector screen you will need to locate a space in your home that will be best suited for it this space should be ideal for your projector and have plenty of room for the screen to hang an appropriate distance from your projector 6 x research source make sure you have a wall with enough empty space to accommodate your finished screen you should have enough space in the room to allow your projector the right amount of distance from the screen all projector models will have different requirements measure your projector image once you ve found the ideal space in your home for your projector and projector screen you will want to measure the actual size of the image from your projector measuring the image size that you plan on using will allow you to determine the final size of your projector screen 7 x research source turn your projector on and have it set to its test image measure the size of the image where you will be using your screen record both the width and the length of the screen gather your materials and tools having measured the image size that your projector will be using you are ready to gather your materials for the screen the size you are building your screen will vary depending on space and projector model however you will need the following basic materials 8 x research source 9 x research source four pine boards for the frame two will be longer and will run horizontally and two shorter boards will be used for the vertical sides of the frame material for the screen itself 53 seamless white paper or blackout cloth can be good choices make sure to have at least an extra 5 of your screen material so that you can attach it to the back of your frame screws and a screwdriver flat corner braces three or four picture hangers a level and pencil to mark guidelines build the frame the frame will be the base upon which your projector screen will be fixed creating a square and level frame will help keep your screen flat smooth and optimized for using your projector on take the following steps to create the perfect frame 10 x research source cut your boards with a handsaw to the length you need if they are too long lay the frame out place a corner brace on each corner where the boards meets sink your screws into the wood through the corner braces check to see how stable your frame is you can add additional braces if needed attach your screen once your frame has been built you can affix your projection screen material on and over it make sure you work slowly and carefully when attaching the screen to ensure that it properly covers the frame and is free from any wrinkles or dips that could affect picture quality 11 x research source lay your screen down flat on the floor place your frame on top of your screen and center it pull the extra screen material up and over the edge of the frame start stapling the screen to the frame space your staples about ten inches apart keep the screen tight as you add staples removing wrinkles as you go go around again and place staples every five inches add the finishing touches although your screen is technically ready to be used you will want to add a few more elements to it these last few additions will allow you to easily hang it on a wall and can help make the edges of the screen look clean and professional 12 x research source screw in regular picture hangers evenly along the top horizontal beam of your frame you can try adding black artists tape to the edges of your screen to give it a nice stylistic finish adding a dark border can also help improve picture quality by cutting down on light reflection draw your guidelines before you can hang your projector screen you will need to make sure you are hanging it in the right place once you hang your projector screen it will be difficult to reposition so take your time and be exact turn your projectors test image on use a pencil to lightly outline where the image is being projected use this guideline to help you hang your projector screen in just the right place mount on a wall now that your screen has been attached to your frame it s time to hang the entire screen on a wall place your screen in the exact position that you took your original screen measurements from to ensure that the projected image will fit once your screen is hung on the wall it s time to sit back and enjoy your favorite films on it 13 x research source use a stud finder to locate stable places on your wall to install the hanger screws and mark them with a pencil draw a level line between the points where you will be adding the hanger screws install the hanger screws using a screwdriver hang the projector screen and enjoy gather your materials and tools building a portable projector screen can be a fun way to allow you to watch movies in any location that has electricity the screen and frame will require you to purchase some easy to find materials from nearly any hardware store take a

how to build a homemade rube goldberg machine,rube goldberg 1883 1970 was a scientist and cartoonist who produced satirical work on people s overly complex problem solving methods in his comical cartoons he linked together chain reactions with simple machines to complete basic tasks like turning on a lamp or frying an egg 1 x research source designing and building a rube goldberg machine requires innovation and patience while every machine is different many builders include versions of other people s ideas tweaking them or linking them in exciting ways,understand the rules if you re building a rube goldberg machine for a class or official competition you will get a packet of information and rules before you plan or build your machine read through this material carefully while you read identify the goal requirements and restrictions if the material is unclear ask your teacher parent or an official to clarify if you don t follow the rules you may get a poor grade or be disqualified from the competition 2 x research source select a basic task for your machine to accomplish rube goldberg machines are complex structures that rely on chain reactions to execute one simple task before you design your machine determine what you want the machine to do if you are competing in a rube goldberg competition or completing an assignment for school you may not have the freedom to choose this task if can pick consider some of the following options open or close a door turn on a light turn off an alarm pour a bowl of cereal turn on a faucet 3 x research source look for inspiration developing a zany complex machine is not an easy task before you create your own rube goldberg machine you may find it helpful to see some examples while you should use these examples as a source of inspiration and direction do not copy someone else s machine instead of replicating these machines make it your goal to improve alter or modernize them potential sources of inspiration include rube goldberg s original cartoons rube goldberg competition submissions youtube videos of functioning rube goldberg machines collect your materials rube goldberg machines transform traditional building materials everyday items and unique objects into functional pieces of equipment that work together to execute a simple task spend time gathering items from around your house purchasing materials from stores and or hunting for unique objects at flea markets possible building materials include dominos wooden boards toilet paper rolls cds or floppy discs fans toy cars skateboards action figures pvc pipe duct tape peg boards zip ties magnets marbles string get creative 4 x research source experiment with the materials lay out all of your materials on your work surface once you re organized start playing with the items as you experiment combine the materials in unexpected ways to form chain reactions while you work keep a record of what combinations worked ask yourself questions throughout the process what object can you use to send a car down a wooden ramp what materials will you need to make a pendulum what can you make with a lever a marble and an action figure develop a building plan rube goldberg machines complete a simple task with a complex chain reaction you can break down the chain reaction into several different steps or phases the steps are connected together by a link when you design the machine it is helpful to start with the last step and work your way to the first step you can create the building plan by listing these steps or drawing the machine for example task pop a balloon step 3 a tack will pop the balloon the tack will be attached to the front of a toy car link 1 the toy car will slide down a wooden ramp step 2 a pendulum will swing into the car and push it down the wooden ramp step 1 i will send the pendulum towards the car at the top of the wooden ramp build a prototype sit down at your workspace with your notes and building plan quickly construct a prototype of your rube goldberg machine this version of your machine doesn t have to be perfect you ll build a final product later after you test it if you run into an issue don t panic return to your notes and see if you can combine the materials in a different way if you are using tools ask an adult for help 5 x research source test your machine for feasibility once your prototype is complete test the machine this first test is to determine if your machine works if the machine completes the task proceed to the next step if the machine doesn t complete the task rethink don t scrap your design can you quickly fix the problem do you need to replace an entire step are you using the best materials is your task possible to achieve build your final product and test its repeatability when your machine has passed the feasibility test you can construct a sturdier version of your rube goldberg machine assess the machine s repeatability its ability to complete the task several times in a row a test is successful if the machine operates on its own test and adjust the machine until it completes the task five times if the test is successful make minor alterations and continue on to the final test if you the machine doesn t produce five successful tests within an hour redesign your machine what steps are working what steps are preventing the machine from working is your task achievable test the machine s reliability after your machine passes the repeatability test determine if it is reliable you will test the machine a total of four times a reliable machine will complete the task at least three out of four times if your machine passes this test you ve created a working rube goldberg machine before you present the machine practice taking

how to cite a photograph,if you discuss or use a photograph in a paper or publication you will need to cite it a good citation protects the photographer s ownership of the image and allows your readers to access the image for further reference the way you cite a photograph will depend on which citation style you are using as well as the source of the photograph if you reproduce a photograph in your work you will need to include an appropriate credit line,follow any style requirements associated with your project if you re citing a photograph for a school paper or a formal publication you might already be expected to follow a particular citation format consult with your teacher professor school publisher or supervisor to find out if they have a preferred citation style if you live in the us the most common citation styles are apa american psychological association mla modern language association and cms chicago manual of style determine your citation style based on subject if you are allowed to set your own citation style you should select one that is standard for the discipline in which you are writing for example apa is usually used for research papers in the social sciences while cms is used for publications and papers in literature history and the arts if you are writing in a specialized discipline like the sciences or law and legal studies choose a citation style that is specific to your discipline e g council of science editors for biology or association of legal writing directors for legal studies 1 x research source use citation requirements set by your source in some cases the source of a photograph may require you to provide particular information about the image or cite the photo in a specific manner for example some photographic archives may require that you include an accession number or reproduction copy number in your citation 2 x research source gather as much information as you can depending on the source of your photograph you may have a lot of information to work with or very little at minimum try to find out the photographer s name the date of the photograph the title of the photograph if there is one the names of any people or places represented in the photograph the original source of the photograph if it is reproduced or taken from somewhere else the current location of the photograph if it is in a gallery or archive include the photographer s name and the date in inline citations if your citation style uses inline citations i e citations given in parentheses in the body of the text you should include the photographer s name and the date of the photograph if known in your citation for example in apa format an inline citation would look like this the cat is shown carrying a toy mouse in its mouth smith 2013 in mla format only the photographer s name is needed e g another image depicts the cat batting a ball of yarn smith if you don t know the photographer s name use a shortened title or description of the work e g cat with mouse 2013 3 x research source give full information about the photo in footnotes and endnotes some citation styles like chicago use footnotes or endnotes instead of inline citations notes allow you to provide more complete information about your sources than inline citations the format of a footnote or endnote will vary depending on which style you are using but it should include the name of the photographer title of the photograph date and current location of the photo in the chicago manual of style format a footnote citation for a photo should look like this 27 harold rouse limestone statue of an egyptian goddess ca 1933 photograph imaginary museum of ancient art if the photograph has no title use a brief description in brackets for example cat playing with a toy mouse cite the source of the photograph if it came from a publication if you got the photograph from a book or other publication you will need to cite the source for example roger steele portrait of my wife 1982 black and white photograph in the works of roger steele by bob smith new york made up books inc 2013 pl 65 a photograph cited from the web should include the url of the page

how to make a rubber mold,maybe you want to preserve a special toy by making a duplicate of it or are curious if the details of a leaf can be reproduced several times no matter the reason creating a rubber mold is a great way to learn a new skill while creating something unique by gathering the right supplies and following simple directions you ll be a rubber mold making expert in no time,find an object that you wish to set in your mold this could be a pinecone toy figurine bouncy ball or any other relatively small object that you wish to duplicate don t worry about your object being too detailed rubber molds are great at catching very intricate designs so the details on your object should show up perfectly 1 x research source if you decide to pick a porous object such as an object made of wood or plaster you ll need to seal it before you create the mold select your mold making material there are a number of companies that sell rubber for making molds but smooth on and polytek are very popular ones they usually come in a kit with two separate compounds that are mixed together to create the liquid rubber 2 x research source the average price for a rubber mold making kit is 30 smooth on offers a variety of different kits that have detailed instructions and an easy process choose a disposable container that will hold the object and liquid rubber you ll need a box or container of some sort to attach your object to and hold the liquid rubber find a container that will fit your object you should leave roughly 0 5 inches 1 3 cm of space between the walls of the container and your object 3 x research source your box could be something like a yogurt or ice cream container anything that will fit your object entirely and you can cut through to remove your mold will work you can also build your own mold box by cutting foam core to create the sides of the box and attaching them together with hot glue you ll have to cut through the container to extract the mold so be sure that you choose a box you re ready to throw away secure your object to the base of the container to ensure that your object doesn t move around once the liquid rubber is poured you must attach it to the base of your container this can be done by simply hot gluing your object to the container you want your object to have a wide base so that once the mold is finished it will be easy to extract the object if your object doesn t have a large base you can create one using a section of wax stick your object into the wide shape of wax and attach the wax to the container s base if you want to reuse your object you can use tape or a different adhesive that won t damage the object just be aware that the different adhesive you choose might not be as stable as the hot glue seal your object and container if necessary if your object is made of wood plaster unglazed ceramic stone concrete or any other porous material you re going to want to seal it use a sealant such as superseal or krylon clear acrylic spray 4 x research source rubber mold suppliers will often have their own sealant that you can purchase along with the rubber mold if your object is made of a non porous material such as plastic metal or glass you don t need to seal it apply a releasing agent to your object and container in order for your object to easily separate from the rubber mold you should apply a releasing agent that covers your object and the container most releasing agents come in the form of a spray or liquid so apply a light coating and be sure to cover the entire area evenly 5 x research source ease release spray on and releasys are all popular releasing agents that can be found in art stores home improvement stores or online prepare the mixture for your rubber mold your rubber will typically come in a two part liquid there should be instructions with the material but most rubbers require you to carefully mix the two parts together using a specific ratio this will create the liquid rubber that you will pour into your mold 6 x research source be sure to stir each liquid part separately in their original containers first before measuring out how much will be poured together the ingredients could have settled which will impact the activation of the rubber thoroughly mix both parts together most times the two parts will be different colors so when you re mixing them together make sure there aren t any color streaks once you re finished once you ve mixed both compounds together you typically have 20 minutes of work time so be ready to pour the liquid rubber into your mold soon after you ve mixed it pour the rubber from above the container to avoid air bubbles when pouring the liquid rubber over your object you want to hold the liquid high above the container and pour it in a thin stream this will help eliminate air being trapped under or around your object which is one of the main concerns when making a rubber mold 7 x research source to ensure that there aren t any air bubbles you can also apply a thin coat of the liquid rubber to your object using a brush of some sort or very gently shake the container once you ve poured the liquid rubber in cover the object with the liquid rubber entirely continue pouring the liquid rubber into the container by holding it high above your object you want to make sure your object is entirely covered by the rubber and that there s a nice even coat on the top if you re not sure how much rubber you re going to need for your mold you can measure it by pouring water over the secured object in the container measure the amount of water that it took to completely cover your object and that s how much liquid rubber you ll need just be sure that your object and container are completely dry before pouring in the mold 8 x research source wait a full day or night for the rubber to set it will depend on the type of rubber you re using as to how long it will take to cure the average curing time for most normal silicones is 18 24 hours while most smooth on molds advertise the cure time to be 6 hours it ll all depend on if there are fast acting catalysts involved so read the directions that come with your mold 9 x research source if you re not sure how long you should wait let the rubber mold set overnight just to be safe remove the object from the mold after you ve let the mold sit for the recommended amount of time it should be firm and ready to be removed if you ve applied the releasing agent it should be very easy to remove your object from the mold cut away the container using scissors or a razor blade being careful not to damage the mold gently peel the edges of the mold away from the container since you created a wide base for your object you ll be able to easily remove it from the mold if any part of it doesn t seem firm or dry replace the container and let it cure for a little while longer,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to paint cornhole boards,if you love playing cornhole but don t want to buy an expensive pair of boards make and paint your own once you ve assembled the basic wooden boards prepare the wood by filling sanding and priming them determine how glossy you want the boards to be and then use a brush or roller to apply the paint always let the boards dry completely before adding coats of paint embellish your cornhole boards with designs decals or stickers,set up your work area choose a well ventilated space to paint the cornhole boards to prevent the buildup of paint fumes paint the boards outside or use an indoor room that has windows or doors you can open lay down drop cloths on a flat work surface to prevent the paint from making a mess for example if you work in your garage keep the garage door open and lay drop cloths directly on the garage floor or a work bench fill any holes with wood filler check your cornhole boards for small holes or knots in the wood dip a putty knife into a container of wood filler so you have just a little bit on the end push the putty knife against the holes to fill them with the wood filler run the putty knife over the wood to smooth out the filler let the wood filler dry according to the manufacturer s instructions 1 x research source most manufacturers recommend letting the filler dry for about 8 hours smooth the boards using sandpaper choose a medium grit piece of sandpaper or sanding block with a range of 60 to 100 rub it over the plain boards to smooth over any bumps or dried wood filler sanding the boards will improve the surface of the boards so the primer and paint go on easier 2 x research source if you prefer you can use an electric sander to smooth the boards down wipe off the boards with a smooth cloth run a clean cloth or rag under clean water and wring it out rub the damp cloth over the boards to remove any dust from sanding the boards let the boards dry completely before you prime them apply a primer to the boards choose a white oil based primer to use on the cornhole boards open the primer and use a paint stirrer to briefly mix the primer dip your brush into the primer or pour some into a paint tray so you can use a roller use the brush or roller to apply a thin layer of primer over both cornhole boards let the primer dry for at least 1 hour or according to the manufacturer s instructions 3 x research source oil based primer works best with wood because it will penetrate deep into the wood and dry harder than water based primers draw the pattern on the boards if you re creating a detailed pattern or design take a pencil and draw the design directly on the primed boards this will give you an outline for painting the boards 4 x research source if you re making geometric designs such as angles that point toward the hole use a ruler or yardstick to draw straight lines choose a paint for the cornhole boards decide how glossy you want the painted boards to be for a slight shine choose a semigloss paint for very shiny boards pick a high gloss paint determine if you want to paint the boards a single color or if you want to paint each of them different colors for example you might paint 1 of the boards red and the other board blue for detailed boards use different colors or hues on each board use a brush or roller to apply a layer of paint to the boards open the paint and use a paint stirrer to combine the pigment and binders in the paint either dip a paintbrush into the paint can and wipe the excess on the rim of the can or pour the paint into a paint tray dip a roller into the tray and roll it back a few times to load the roller with paint brush or roll a thin layer of paint evenly over the board consider using spray paint if you dislike painting or want to quickly get an even layer of paint on the boards buy spray paint wear a face mask when using the spray paint so you don t breathe in the fumes spray the paint slowly and evenly so it doesn t pool on the boards 5 x research source to ensure that overspray from the spray paint won t get on any surrounding items move things away from your work space and lay a drop cloth over the entire area dry the boards for at least 2 hours before applying another coat of paint follow the manufacturer s drying instructions or wait at least 2 hours before you apply another coat of paint you ll probably need to paint a total of 3 to 5 coats of paint waiting the full 2 hours between each coat of paint darker colors of paint or higher quality paint will need fewer coats of paint add extra colors or details if you drew a design on the cornhole board dip your paintbrush into another color of paint and paint along the design for a cornhole board set that will really stand out consider painting each board different colors such as the colors of your favorite sports teams use painter s tape to create crisp edges or lines consider laying down painter s tape if you want to paint the edges a different color or just want to paint straight lines across the boards the painter s tape can keep the paint from one section from bleeding into the next area on the board painter s tape is designed to peel off easily without removing the paint underneath it use a stencil to make designs on the board if you d like to make a complicated design such as one with lots of swirls or small curves use a stencil to get the high level of detail lay the stencil on the cornhole board and tape it down with a few pieces of painter s tape paint or spray paint over the stencil and then lift the stencil away let the design dry completely 6 x research source apply decals or stickers if you don t want to paint special designs by hand but you want to make the boards look unique place decals or stickers on them to apply most decals or stickers remove the backing and lay them on the painted boards rub over the decals or stickers to remove any air bubbles 7 x research source include lettering on the boards if you d like paint letters or words on the boards decide if you want to paint them by hand or use a stencil to paint them by hand draw a light guideline with a ruler to ensure that you paint the letters straight if you d rather not freehand the letters lay down a stencil and paint over the letters you need you could also apply letter decals to make your word 8 x research source have a variety of brush sizes around so you can make the letters different sizes if necessary,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a sculpture,there are many types of sculpture but they can generally be split into two camps addition sculpture where material is largely added on to create the form clay wax cardboard papier mache etc and reduction sculpture where material is entirely taken away in order to create the form stone wood ice etc this tutorial will give you the basic on both forms so that you can get on your way to reveal your inner michelangelo just get started with step 1 below 1 x research source,sketch your sculpture always draw out the sculpture you plan on making first it doesn t have to be a great drawing but it should help you get an idea of where everything goes and how the shapes will meet up draw the sculpture from multiple angles you may want to draw a more detailed sketch as well for areas that are highly detailed create a base if your sculpture will have a base it s a good idea to build that first and build the sculpture on the base the base will be less structurally sound if added later you can build a base from wood metal clay stone or any other material you want build an armature armature is a word sculptors use that just means support structure it s like the bones for your sculpture it keeps pieces from breaking off and while not every part of your sculpture will need an armature it s important for pieces like arms or legs which move away from the body and are easy breaking points 2 x research source armatures can be made out of thin or thick gauge wire plumping pipes pvc pipe lumber sticks dowels or any other material that works for you generally start with the spine of the piece and create branches for the limbs using your design sketch can be helpful for forming the armature especially if the sketch was made to scale anchor your armature in or to your base before continuing fill in the basic form depending on what your sculpture will be made out of you may want to form an underlayer with a different material this is most common when sculpting with polymer clay an underlayer can help reduce materials cost and weight so consider using one common materials are newspaper tin or aluminum foil masking or painter s tape and cardboard loosely tape or join this filler material to your armature forming just the basic shapes of your sculpture you want to leave yourself room to build with your final sculpting material though so don t go overboard move from large forms to smaller ones start adding on your sculpting material start by creating the largest pieces the large muscle groups to the smallest ones the small muscle groups go from larger details to smaller ones add on and take away material as necessary but avoid taking away too much material as it can be difficult to add it back on 3 x research source add in details one the general form seems complete start blending carving and generally creating the finer details these are items like hair eyes the outlines and curve of muscles fingers toes etc detail your sculpture until it looks fairly finalized 4 x research source add in textures the final step in the actual sculpting is to add textures to your sculpture if you want to this is important for creating a more realistic look but isn t necessary if you want to work in a different style you can use sculpting tools to add texture or you can create your own from household tools 5 x research source with proper tools the general rule of thump is that the smaller the tip the finer the detail that tool is meant to create looped tools are for scraping off clay and any cutting edge is for pretty much what you would think it would be for you can fashion your own tools from tin foil balls black peppercorns toothbrushes toothpicks necklace chains ball bearings combs sewing or knitting needles knives etc cure your sculpture you will need to bake your sculpture or allow it to dry whichever is appropriate for the material you chose follow the manufacturer s instructions for your material 6 x research source paint your sculpture if you want your sculpture to be painted or colored do so after baking you may need to use special paints depending on the material you chose painting polymer clay for example requires model enamel paint 7 x research source mix media you can create extra interest for your sculpture by mixing media this can make it seem more real or add interesting color and texture to a piece consider things like using real fabric for clothing or using fake or real hair instead of sculpting the hair 8 x research source make a sculpture sketch start by making a clay wax or other fast version of your sculpture this will be used as a sketch you will take measurements from it and use those to carve the stone or other sculpting material 9 x research source carve the basic form you can take basic measurements from you sculpture and mark the stone or wood where you know it will need to be cut for example if you know your sculpture isn t going to be more than 14 inches 35 6 cm high you can cut away all material above 15 inches 38 1 cm leave some room for movement but certainly carve out the basic shape of your sculpture 10 x research source use a pointing machine using a pointing machine or other measuring device begin to measure your sculpture sketch and make the same locations and depths on your stone or wood 11 x research source carve in the details using tools appropriate for your material begin to chip away at the material and even out the points that you made using the pointing machine sand down your sculpture using gradually finer and finer sandpaper sand down your sculpture until it is as smooth as you want it to be done add any final extra details that you want and enjoy your sculpture,Hobbies-and-Crafts

designs later remember that you can put a crochet stitch just about anywhere you can put a crochet hook you can crochet into a row of holes on a hem or a piece of paper the side of a piece of knitting or another piece of crochet in fact adding a decorative border to something even a t shirt sleeve or greeting card is a good practice at improvising you can also go in a new direction at just about any point in a project by adding a chain and using it as you would a starting chain you can also use chains as an element by themselves experiment crochet does not take a lot of time to do and chances are you have some leftover yarn around that you can use to make mistakes with confidence look in craft store bargain bins for unwanted yarn at crazy prices this makes excellent yarn for experimenting with try garage sales and thrift shops too you can often pick up the leftovers from somebody else s project for pennies try scrumbling or free form crochet scrumbling is the process of making and combining smaller free form pieces into a larger piece it can be used for a small decorative element as shown or combined into a larger piece of fabric something like a patchwork quilt besides being a good way to use up odds and ends of yarn scrumbling is good practice improvising and innovating with a crochet hook and making different shapes try modifying an existing pattern sizing it to a custom fit or adapting it for a different yarn and hook these crocheted hand warmers are meant to be crocheted to your size no matter what yarn and hook you are using learn how gauge works stitches take up a certain width depending on your yarn your hook and your technique in this example seven stitches make up two inches 5cm of width there are various ways you can use gauge you can guess and check how many stitches to make make some number of stitches try on or measure the piece and adjust as necessary to achieve the size you need you can adjust the number of stitches in an existing pattern that states a gauge so that your result comes out at the intended size you can calculate the number of stitches you will need to achieve a given measurement or size it s a simple proportion multiply stitches per inch by inches to get the number of stitches you ll need this works equally well with centimeters as long as you re consistent about which unit to use if you want you can do the same thing to figure the number of rows you ll need for the desired height of the piece simply measure the height of several rows in your sample piece and calculate it the same way decide what you would like to make a crocheted piece can be utilitarian decorative or both you can make a flat afghan in square rows a free form sculpture or anything in between perhaps a particular type or combination of yarn will inspire something perhaps a particular need like keeping somebody warm will inspire something don t be afraid to sketch what you have in mind or make a small sample piece to test a concept you may discover that you can make a piece or you may discover what you d like to do a bit differently start simple and small make up your own scarf bottle cozy or arm warmers then try designing a vest or shawl before you attempt an entire sweater write things down as you go if you want to be able to share the pattern you create with friends post it online or simply get a second sock or mitten to match the first you ll need to take notes they can be as simple or as detailed as you prefer provided that you can make sense of them when you re done and if need be translate between your own shorthand and something another crocheter can read learn how sewing patterns fit together crochet allows you to make a fabric in a certain shape which need not be flat having a sense of what the panels in stitched clothing should look like will give you an idea of what shape to make pieces of something like a sweater you can do things with crochet that you can t readily do by cutting flat fabric for example if you are crocheting in the round you can increase each row to produce a disc if you increase less than necessary to produce a flat piece the result will be a fabric that dishes or cups if you increase more than necessary to produce a disc the fabric will curl and ruffle taking on a shape like a potato chip if you do not increase at all you will get a cylindrical tube smallurl

how to untie shoelace or string knots,knots keep our shoes on they hold up our clothes lines and they allow us to sail our boats basically knots are great but when a knot goes awry untying it can be a painstaking and frustrating task especially in shoelaces or thin strings the thinner the string the more difficult a knot can be to untie if it has been pulled tight however almost all knots can be untied eventually with patience and ingenuity,try to understand the knot if you are untrained in knot theory this can be tricky but opening a knot is much easier if you know which loops and intersections are holding it together study it for a moment and try to determine which direction each loop should be pulled to loosen the knot 1 x research source give your string some slack outside the knot you won t be able to untie the knot if the ends outside of it are pulled tight 2 x research source get a firm grip on two strands of the knot with the tips of your fingers one in each hand depending on how thin your string is this might be impossible if you need to use your fingernails gently work the two strings back and forth until you feel some looseness to untie a knot you need to create slack depending on how you are holding the knot that can mean pushing instead of pulling be gentle but firm tugging the wrong way too hard can just tighten the knot further move on to a different pair of loops until the knot loosens keep working the knot from different angles trying different combinations until you get one or two spots of looseness get a good grip on the slack spots and pull open the knot just make sure you don t accidentally pull the knot tight again pull one end of the string back through the open loops to undo the knot once the knot opens up into a series of crossing loops the surest way to get it untied for good is to trace one end back through the loops until there are no intersections twist one loose end of the string as tight as you can you want it so tight that the string becomes dense and less bendy 3 x research source firmly push the twisted end directly into the knot the idea is that the twisted string will be twin and hard enough to overcome the friction of the knot and create some slack 4 x research source use the slack it adds to pull the knot apart once you ve pushed some slack into the knot you should be able to pull it apart as normal find a clear level surface lay the knot on the surface bang on the knot with a firm but light object a wooden spoon is ideal keep turning the knot around and giving it another bang until it loosens a little once there is a tiny gap insert the end of tweezers or nail scissors into the little hole ease the knot open gradually it should now slip undone get an ordinary corkscrew you can also use any other thin metal object like a needle for smaller knots just be careful not to pierce and damage your string 5 x research source insert the point of the corkscrew between the strings of the knot basically any point on the knot will do 6 x research source wiggle and twist the corkscrew into the knot hopefully this will create some slack tug the corkscrew to loosen the knot and untie as normal,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a flagpole,you may not want a large permanent flagpole which towers above your head instead create a small scale flagpole that can be easily disassembled and transported use pvc for the pole itself and a bucket filled with cement for the base use a special trick to make the pole easily detachable from the base with a few materials and a bit of time you ll have a great looking flagpole to display your favorite flag,cut a piece of pvc to your desired flagpole height for this flagpole four to about seven feet high is best within that range you are free to choose the exact height buy the pvc and either have the store cut it to length or measure and cut it yourself use a hacksaw to cut the pvc mark the halfway point on the pvc you ll be attaching a cleat which is what holds the rope in place on the flagpole use a tape measure to find the halfway point on the pole and mark it with a marker drill holes in the pvc for the rope cleat buy a rope cleat kit at your local hardware store a flag store or online the kit will provide screws to make it easier to screw the cleat onto the pole make holes with a power drill use a bit that is slightly smaller in diameter than the cleat screws 1 x research source if the cleat kit includes a parts list check the size of the screws for example they might be ⅛ inch 3 18mm choose a drill bit that is one size smaller than the screws so the screws will still catch the sides of the drilled holes you ll drill holes for two screws use the cleat as a guide for how far apart the holes need to be follow the cleat kit instructions to attach it to the pvc open the kit and lay the pieces out on the ground lay the pvc flat on the ground and fit the cleat into place use a screwdriver to screw the rope cleat to the pvc attach a flagpole truck pulley to one end of the pvc buy a flagpole truck pulley when you buy the cleat kit if you don t know exactly what to buy ask someone at the store or search on the website where you bought the cleat kit use the provided screws to attach the pulley to the flagpole 2 x research source wrap the end of the pvc with plastic get some plastic sheeting and cut out a piece that is roughly a 3ftx3ft 9 m square place the non pulley end of the pvc in the center of the square bunch the plastic up around the pole secure it with duct tape 3 x research source you ll stick the flagpole into a bucket which you ll fill with cement the plastic wrap helps make it so the pvc can be removed from the concrete the directed size is an estimate the height of your bucket will determine how high up the pvc needs to be covered with plastic the important part is that you put the hole of the pvc in the center so the hole does not get cement inside it smear the plastic with petroleum jelly in addition to the plastic wrap petroleum jelly will help you remove the flagpole from the cement once it hardens rub a thin layer of jelly all over the plastic you don t need to use an excessive amount as petroleum jelly is slick with only a little bit 4 x research source buy quick dry pre mixed concrete from a hardware store for a small project like this your best option is to by a bag of dry mix which has the concrete stone and sand all in the same bag one bag should be more than enough for a single flagpole 5 x research source mix up the cement by following the directions on the packaging grab a bucket that is not the one you ll use for the flagpole base unless the package directs you differently add the mix to the bucket and slowly add water mixing it up as you go 6 x research source use a shovel or a hoe to mix the cement the right consistency is when the cement slowly slides off of the tool set the pole into the bucket if you have someone who can help you with the next steps ask them to help you now grab the bucket you want to use as the flagpole base hold the pvc so the plastic wrapped end is right in the middle of the bucket it s best to hold a level against it to make sure it stays perfectly straight up pour cement evenly into the bucket around the pole while your partner holds the pvc and the level pour cement into the base bucket make sure to pour it evenly around the pole you don t have to fill the bucket all the way to the top as this will make the base too heavy to move fill the bucket at least halfway full with concrete hold the pvc for a few minutes until the top of the cement forms a crust at this point it will be settled enough that you can let go of the pvc leave the cement to dry overnight it can take a while for the cement to fully harden so leave the flagpole somewhere that it won t be bothered you can test the hardness of the cement every so often by gently moving the pvc when it doesn t move at all the cement is hardened fully always read the directions for the specific brand of concrete mix you ve bought they will give you an idea about how long the concrete will take to full set take the plastic wrap off of the pole once the cement is hardened slide the pvc out of the base the petroleum jelly should keep the pole from staying stuck in the cement remove the plastic wrap and discard it in the garbage stick the flagpole back into the hole which formed when the cement hardened string a rope through the pulley find a length of rope that is the right length for your flagpole the rope should be about one foot longer than the full length of the pvc flagpole loop it through the pulley at the top of the pole and let it hang down attach flag hooks to the rope use fasteners designed specifically for flags or use carabiners or other fasteners string them onto the rope and tie a knot under them to hold them at that same position on the rope hang your flag and tie the rope off attach your flag to the fasteners through the eyelets on the end of the flag then raise the flag to the top of your pole tie the rope around the rope cleat which is designed to hold the rope in place,Hobbies-and-Crafts

strands but four or eight are most common choose the number of strands and the colors you want to use then get started on your own 4 or 8 strand round braid,choose the colors for your braid decide on the colors that will appear in your round braid select just one or two or up to as many as four or eight different colors depending on which type of braid you do for a 4 strand round braid one or two colors are typically used in different configurations but you can use up to four different colors for each strand if you wish for an 8 strand braid typically one or two colors are used to create patterns but you can use as many as eight different colors for each strand tie strands together at the end tie the pieces of material you will use for your braid together at one end use a simple overhand knot tying all four pieces around themselves to secure them together you can fold over one longer piece of your material to create two strands in which case you will tie together the loop ends of the folded pieces remember that this will create two strands of the same color when you plan out what colors you will use don t worry about how neat or perfect this knot is as you will likely redo it or use a fastening instead to complete your final braided item secure the end of your material to something fasten the knotted end of your strands to an object that will keep them firmly in place while you are pulling and tightening the strands to create the braid tape the end to a work surface loop it over a hook pin it to your pant leg or whatever method works for you 1 x research

arrange your colors for a 4 strand braid pattern decide on how you d like your colors to appear once they are braided and arrange the strands accordingly two colors on a 4 strand round braid can create a spiral or diamond shapes depending on what order the colored strands are in when you begin begin with two strands of the same color in the middle and the outside two strands in a different color for a pattern that will look like a spiral in other words you can hold one strand of each color in each hand if you are holding onto the strands to braid begin with two strands of one color on

the other if you re holding onto the strands the whole time to braid 2 x research source arrange your colors for an 8 strand braid pattern decide on how you want your colors to look once included in an 8 strand braid arrange the strands according to whether you d like a large chevron small chevron or stripe pattern for your completed braid for a two color wide chevron pattern that appears on two sides of the braid place two strands of each color on the left or in your left hand and two strands of each color on the right or in your right hand four strands of the same color should all be next to each other in the middle for a two color narrow chevron pattern that appears on all four sides of the braid arrange the strands alternately with a strand of the first color then a strand of the second color then a strand of the first color and so on for two colored stripes down the braid place all four strands of one color on the left or in your left hand and all four strands of the other color on the right or in your right hand 3 x research source move the rightmost strand underneath the two middle strands lay out your strands or hold them in your hands so they are separate from each other use the strand on the far right and pass it under the two strands in the middle 4 x research source if it helps you you can think about labelling the strands from left to right as a b c and d when you begin bring the d strand underneath c and b so that the order is now a d b c 5 x research source either place your strands carefully on a flat surface or hold them tightly in your hand as they must remain in order throughout the braiding wrap that strand over and between the two middle strands take the rightmost strand that you just moved under the two middle strands wrap it over one of those middle strands so that it falls in between the two of them if you re using letters to label your strands you would be taking the d strand and placing it over b so that it is in between b and c the order from left to right would then be a b d c tighten the strands up toward your end knot so that the braid stays even make sure the strands stay spread out in the same way as when you began even though some will have changed positions bring the leftmost strand under the two middle strands take the strand that s on the far left and bring it underneath your current two middle strands this mirrors the same first step you took with the strand on the right 6 x research source your lettered strands were a b d c from left to right after tightening the first side you will now take the a strand and bring it underneath b and d thus the new order will be b d a c remember to keep all strands carefully in place while you braid whether laying them out neatly on a table or holding them firmly in your hands bring that strand over and between the two middle strands hold the far left strand that you just brought under the two middle strands wrap it back over so it falls in the between those two strands if following letters from the previous step that ended in the order b d a c bring a over d so that it rests in between b and d the new order from left to right will then be b a d c tighten the strands up toward your end knot to keep the braid looking even now you have completed this sequence on both the right and left side keep the strands separated in the same way as you begun even though they are now in a different order repeat these steps down the length of your material continue moving the rightmost strand under the middle two strands and over to rest in between them then do the same to the leftmost strand repeat these motions over and over until you reach your desired length or the end of your material if you forget what side you left off on at any point you can tell which strand to start with because either the rightmost or leftmost strand will appear slightly higher up where it comes out of your braid this is the strand to move next 7 x research source pause occasionally if you are using very long pieces of material for your braid to untangle them at the ends ensure that you don t lose the order of your strands by holding them down with your hand or another heavy flat object while you gently untangle the ends separate half the strands to the right and half to the left lay out and separate each of your strands flat on the table with four of them to the right four to the left and a space in between them in the middle you can also hold four strands in each hand if you choose to use that method for braiding make sure you pay attention to where colors are placed if you re going for a certain pattern as you start making your braid you should return to this placement of four strands to the left and four to the right to ensure that the strands stay neat and in order take the rightmost strand and bring it under five other strands take the strand that s on the far right of all eight of your strands bring it under the three other strands that you have extending to the right as well as under two of the strands extending to the left if you d like to use letters to help keep track of the strands you can label them a b c d e f g h with the indicating the space you should leave between the two groups of strands take the h strand and bring it underneath g f e d and c so that it rests in between b and c the new order would be a b h c d e f g keep the strands arranged so that some extend out to the right and some extend out to the left once you move the rightmost strand in this step there will temporarily be five strands on the left and only three on the right bring that strand back over the last two strands take the strand you just moved underneath five other strands and bring it back over the last two this will place the strand back over with the group of strands on the right but in a new position toward the middle with lettering take the h strand from its position between b and c at the end of the previous step wrap it over c and d to rest next to e on the right side the new configuration would be a b c d h e f g tighten the strands by pulling up toward the end knot it s essential that you keep four strands on the right and four on the left even though you ve changed the positions of the strands slightly take the leftmost strand and bring it under five other strands pick up the strand on the far left of all your strands and bring it under the three others on the left as well as two of the strands on the right this repeats the same thing you did with the rightmost strand this time on the left side with lettered strands after the previous steps the order was a b c d h e f g now take the a strand and bring it under b c d h and e so that it rests between e and f just like on the first side this will temporarily make it so that there are now five strands on one side the right this time and only three strands on the other the left this time bring that strand back over the last two strands take the strand you just moved from the left and under five other strands wrap it back over the last two strands so that it resumes its place with the other three strands on the left but now in a new position toward the middle with lettering you ll move the a strand that you placed between e and f previously take it over e and h so that it rests on the other side next to d the order then becomes b c d a h e f g tighten the strands up toward the end knot and you have now completed the same thing on both sides keep four strands on the right and left like you do to begin even though they are now in a different order repeat these steps for the rest of your material continue moving the rightmost strand under the next five strands and back over the last two then do the same to the leftmost strand repeat these motions over and over until you reach your desired length or the end of your material if at any point you forget what side you left off on the strand to start with is the rightmost or leftmost strand that appears slightly higher up where it comes out of your braid 8 x research source pause to untangle your strands if you are using long pieces of material keep the order of your strands by holding them down with your hand or another heavy flat object while you gently untangle the ends,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the pleiades star cluster,the pleiades or seven sisters form a beautiful star cluster near the constellation taurus this is one of the nearest star clusters to earth and perhaps the most beautiful to the naked eye over the millennia it has inspired folklore around the world and is now studied as a recent birthplace for new stars 1 x research source,look for the pleiades in autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere the pleiades star cluster becomes visible to evening observers in october and disappears in april november is the best time to look for the pleiades when they are visible from dusk to dawn and reach their highest point in the sky 2 x research source in early october the pleiades become visible a couple hours after sunset by about february the pleiades are already high in the sky at sunset 3 x research source the exact timing depends on your latitude the pleiades are visible in late summer and early autumn as well but only in the middle of the night face the southern sky the pleiades rise in the southeast after dusk and travel west during the night during their peak in november they climb high in the sky and disappear in the northwest before dawn in late winter and early spring they will only be visible for a few hours traveling east to west across the southern part of the sky 4 x research source find orion orion the hunter is one of the most famous and distinct constellations in the sky on a winter evening at a mid northern latitude he stands almost due south about halfway between the horizon and the sky directly above your head 5 x research source locate him by his belt a straight line of three bright stars close together the red star nearby betelgeuse forms his left shoulder from your perspective while the blue giant rigel on the other side of the belt is his right leg 6 x research source follow the line of the belt to aldebaran treat orion s belt as an arrow pointing to your next landmark moving from left to right in the sky at most times and places this will point to the northwest the next bright star you see in this direction is another bright red orange star aldebaran this is the arabic word for follower likely named because it chases the pleiades each night 7 x research source aldebaran is not in a perfect line with the belt don t try to get there with binoculars or you may miss it aldebaran dips below the horizon around march or earlier in extreme northern latitudes 8 x research source if aldebaran isn t visible try to follow orion s belt all the way to pleiades move onward to find the pleiades continue moving your eyes in the same direction usually northwest from orion s belt to aldebaran and beyond fairly near to aldebaran you should see a tight cluster of blue stars these are the pleiades also called the seven sisters or m45 9 x research source most people can only see six stars with the naked eye or even just a hazy clump if light pollution interferes 10 x research source with a clear night and keen dark adjusted eyes you may see more than seven the seven sisters are clustered close together from end to end the cluster is only ⅔ the width of orion s belt 11 x research source this is much less than the length of the big dipper or little dipper star patterns which some novice stargazers confuse with this one use taurus as a guide next time the red star aldebaran described above is also the eye of the constellation taurus the bull the hyades star cluster nearby forms the chin of the bull if you become familiar with this constellation you can find it as a starting point and look for the pleiades nearby 12 x research source taurus may be difficult to see during a bright moon especially near an urban area 13 x research source watch for the pleiades in spring and summer the pleiades are visible from about october to april during the southern hemisphere s spring and summer months face the northern sky during late november the pleiades rise in the northeast around dusk and travel west until dawn as the seasons progress the pleiades start higher in the sky when the stars appear and spend less time in the sky look for a line of bright stars orion is standing on his head in the southern hemisphere so some observers call this constellation a sauce pan instead with orion s sword the handle pointing upward 14 x research source the rim of the saucepan or orion s belt is a trio of bright stars in a straight line this distinct shape is a starting point for locating many constellations this line has the bright red star betelgeuse on one side and the bright blue star rigel on the other follow the line left in the sky to aldebaran use the line as an arrow pointing left across the sky the next bright star in this direction is aldebaran a bright red supergiant this is the eye of the constellation taurus the bull if the sky is clear and the moon is dim you can see the chin of the bull right next to aldebaran formed by the hyades star cluster continue on to the pleiades keep following the same line from orion s belt and you ll run into a fairly dim cluster of blue stars these are the pleiades also called the seven sisters although most people can only see six or fewer and telescopes can see many more the pleiades are an asterism a star pattern much smaller than a constellation if you hold your thumb out at arm s length the cluster is only about twice the width of your thumbnail 15 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build a still,stills are used for many purposes from purifying water to making gasoline a still can also be used to make alcohol but in many countries using a still to make liquor is against the law and can be a dangerous undertaking both in terms of the process itself and consuming the end product however it is perfectly legal and potentially life saving to build a still that purifies water in addition water stills are interesting contraptions for those with an interest in science so some people build stills as a fun project,get your materials you will need a variety of materials most of which you can get at your local hardware store bending copper tubing is involved so if you really want to make your life easier you can get a tool which helps you bend tubes found in the plumbing department of your local hardware store the materials you ll really need are you ll need a kettle or a pressure cooker preferably copper or stainless steel absolutely never aluminum or lead a cork or rubber stopper which will fit the opening of your kettle or pressure cooker 8mm copper tubing amount will depend on set up 10 20 ft is a good amount a very large thermos small watercooler or a plastic bucket if you re cheap tube couplings maybe a thermometer a good drill some silicon or sugru make the stopper drill two holes in your rubber or cork one for the copper tube and one for the thermometer these holes should be very slightly smaller than the tube and thermometer to create a tight fit make sure the stopper you use is generally cut to tightly fit the opening of your kettle or pressure cooker prepare the copper coil you will need a copper coil to condense the vapor coming from the pot take your 8mm copper tubing and shape it into a coil towards one end you will need a long straight section and a short at least 6 straight section on each side of the coil to bend the coil you can simply bend it around an object or you can use tools designed for bending tube the coil should be small enough to fit in the thermos or watercooler with about 1 of space on either side these copper coils tend to kink very easily to avoid this you can block the tube at one end and fill the tube with salt or sugar never use sand use a funnel and make sure to shake the tube as you fill it to make sure that it fills evenly make your condenser the watercooler will be your condenser drill a hole on the side at the bottom where the short section of copper tube will come out and deposit your distilled product then drill a hole at the top on the lid this is where the long section of tube will come out place the coil in the condenser put the copper tubing in the condenser threading the short end through the hole at the bottom once enough of the short end is coming out of the condenser seal the edges of the hole with silicon or other material like sugru or caulk then thread the long straight section of the tube through the hole at the top if you want it to be easier to get the lid on and off cut the tube a few inches after it comes out the hole on the top have a separate section which spans the distance and goes into the kettle connect the two with couplings which can be undone as necessary make sure you unplug the tube if you did so to fill it with salt you will also want to empty the tube and rinse out the salt before doing this step although it can also be done afterwards with a greater amount of difficulty connect the tube to the pot connect the long portion of the tube to the kettle or pressure cooker by inserting the other end of the tube into the kettle it should be inserted only enough to reach inside the kettle not be submerged in the liquid insert the thermometer insert the thermometer into the appropriate hole make sure it is place deep enough that the end will be submerged but that it will not touch the bottom or the sides of the pot use the still correctly fill the condenser with ice water and rock salt make sure you use this still on an electric stove as open flames can cause problems do not heat the pot once everything has boiled away and generally be careful as pressure can build up if you have done something incorrectly if distilling alcohol don t drink anything which comes out when the temperature reads below 173 f or you will be treated to the best in beverages that make you blind 1 x research source gather your materials you will need a container for the distilled water a plastic sheet and a shovel you may also want some plastic tubing dig a hole dig a hole about as large as the plastic sheet and deep enough so that when you weigh the center of the sheet down there will be several inches between the bottom of the sheet and the bottom of the hole 2 x research source this is the sort of still that would be good if you actually have to distill your drinking water if you get stranded on a desert island this is your best option insert your container set your drinking container in the center of the hole and partially bury it to keep it from falling over insert one end of the plastic tubing into the container and lay the other end well outside the hole the goal is to keep the tubing clean and secure so it doesn t fall back into the hole 3 x research source add plant material line the hole with cactus leaves or other living plant parts if they are available placing plants in the hole isn t necessary but will help your still produce more water cover your hole cover the hole with a plastic sheet use rocks to weigh down the corners 4 x research source add a weight carefully place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet so it slopes downward at an angle of about 45 degrees the lowest point should be directly over the container in the hole but not touching it seal the edges cover all edges of the plastic sheet with dirt or sand to keep water vapor from escaping take care not to cover the plastic tubing 5 x research source wait for moisture to collect wait two or three hours for moisture to collect on the plastic sheet and run down the sides into the container 6 x research source drink drink the water through the plastic tubing you can disassemble the still and drink directly from the container but you will have to build the still again when you re through in the meantime any water vapor on the sheet will evaporate get a fairly deep large bowl this bowl can be plastic aluminum or steel but it should not be made of lead put this bowl on a sunny surface outside 7 x trustworthy source u s department of energy official site for the u s department of energy which provides resources related to energy safety conservation and efficiency go to source put a cup or small bowel in the larger bowl the cup or bowl should be shorter than the edges of the large bowl fill the large bowl with water fill the large bowl with water but do not go over the edge of the small bowel or cup cover the bowl with plastic wrap cover the bowl very tightly with plastic wrap use tape or rubber bands to ensure a tight seal place a weight at the center of the plastic this should be right over your cup or bowl and should angle the plastic down make sure the plastic does not touch the cup though a good weight to use would be a rock 8 x research source wait for your water the sun will evaporate the water in the large bowl causing the water vapor to rise and condense on the plastic since the plastic is weighted and angled the condensation will roll down into your cup mmmm clean water,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to write a radio ad,successful radio advertisements motivate consumers to take action with powerful words catchy jingles and attention grabbing sound effects copy writers have to hold their audience s attention 15 30 or 60 seconds so that they provide all of the relevant information in order to achieve this balance copy writers must remain persistent and creative,choose the right length for your ad radio ads are recorded and produced into 15 30 or 60 second segments when settling on a the length for your ad you must consider your budget creative format and the public s familiarity with your product or service if you don t have any financial restrictions you may find it helpful to write a variety 15 30 and 60 second ads as you write read through your ad at a normal pace to make sure you fall within the intended time frame if your product or service is well known and or you have a limited budget a 15 second ad may suffice if your ad is in the form of a creative narrative you may need 60 seconds tell your tale and sell the product or service 1 x research source keep 15 second ads simple when writing a 15 second radio ad you only have enough time to share basic information about the product or service if your target audience is already aware of the product or service this is an ideal and effective ad length in this short window of time you must mention the name of the business event individual the product or service its cost and contact information the word count of your short radio spot should be between 30 to 40 words 2 x research source captivate your audience with a 30 second radio ad copywriters do not have to strip down a 30 second ad to basic facts they may include more details in a 30 second ad than in a 15 second ad this slightly extended time frame allows them to write in a more creative and compelling manner you could write a dialogue include testimonials or even tell a short anecdote your 30 second ad should contain no more than 80 words 3 x research source be more thorough with a 60 second spot the average radio ad lasts for 60 seconds the one minute slot provides enough time for copywriters to make a complete sales pitch to the intended audience the writer can grab the listener s attention highlight a problem provide an answer and guarantee the customer or client s satisfaction a 60 second slot is the ideal length for promoting new products and services your 60 second ad should not contain more than 160 words 4 x research source produce a straight announcer ad this creative format centers around a sole strong voice this single voice speaks to not shouts at the listener sharing basic information about the service or product the copy must match this simple format it should be clear direct and focused when executed properly it should sound as though this single voice is talking directly to one person in addition to sharing basic facts this straight announcer may pose open ended questions such as do you ever or would you like to this is a great creative format for 15 second ads 5 x research source sell the product or service with a dialog people love to listen in on other s conversations or dialogs in this creative format one character has a problem which the other character solves by recommending the product or service the product or service s benefits are relayed through thoughtfully placed questions and carefully worded answers problem i have a date to the prom but no suit solution i rented my tux from _____ it was fast easy and inexpensive problem my child gets so bored in the summer solution i heard about this great fine arts camp near our house they have sessions all summer long 6 x research source grab your audience s attention with a vignette a vignette provides listeners a peek into another person s life this brief tale allows your listener to identify with the character once they see themselves in the add the hope is that they will seek the same product or service as the individual highlighted in the vignette 7 x research source open your ad with a short vignette dramatizing an individual s specific problem the goal is to have your listeners identify with the individual in the vignette oh no i ve burnt the cake for harry s birthday to a crisp what will i do his surprise party is tonight once you have established the problem cut away to an announcer the announcer will contextualize the problem and offer a solution i e the product or service being advertised the announcer also provides all of the product or service details don t let a burnt cake spoil your next party surprise your guest of honor with a delicious cake from manny s bakery at manny s bakery we offer a variety of pre decorated cakes baked fresh for every occasion time permitting return to the character from the vignette provide a glimpse at how the announcer s solution solved their problem wow honey this cake is delicious don t thank me harry thank manny s bakery conclude with a call to action from the announcer visit manny s bakery today 8 x research source include testimonials in your ad testimonials are reviews of the product or service given by real people the power of the testimonial is not derived from clever copy but from the person actually providing the testimonial real people give the best possible endorsements these testimonials are raw honest believable and aspirational there are several forms of testimonials interview random people on the street about a well established product or service ask these individuals why they like the product or service and how it has impacted their daily life ask real people celebrities or experts to praise the product or service while describing its use and benefits 9 x research source use your research on the product or service the content of your copy should be inspired and informed by the research you conducted on the product or service the intended audience will likely have questions that are similar to your research questions good copy anticipates these questions answering them before the customer even has a chance to wonder always write with your audience in mind scrutinize each word phrase and sentence of the copy to ensure that it will be well received by your target audience provide your audience with a comprehensive understanding of the product or service explicitly state how the product or service will benefit improve or fill the need of your customer or client 10 x research source create copy that is engaging and simple radio ads are frequently tuned out by listeners and extremely short to compensate for these circumstances copywriters must capture their audience s attention quickly and write short precise and clear copy that holds their listeners attention achieving this delicate balance is tricky but possible do not try to share every detail about the product or service in the copy keep your message simple and the focus on the product or service don t let the copy get bogged down by an overworked creative format the product or service should not be overshadowed by a vignette dialog or testimonial revise your copy with an editing eye consider every word phrase and sentence carefully could you shorten a sentence from 15 words to 6 words is that joke relevant is there a better word 11 x research source remember that most people who are listening to radio advertisements are driving a car when the music or show stops they are apt to change the station the copy must stop them from changing that station or get through the other thoughts they have in their head while driving provide your audience with a clear call to action in addition to presenting the product or service in comprehensive and articulate manner radio ads must also call its listeners to action in other words you must explicitly tell the intended audience what it is you want them to do call to actions may include telling your listeners to buy the product or try the service go to a sale at a specific store contact the manufacturer or business attend a concert or club watch a specific television show 12 x research source use sound effects wisely radio ads rely heavily on sound effects and music to help listeners visualize a scene when incorporated into the copy correctly sound effects and music can elevate and transform an ad as you write the words of the radio ad simultaneously envision the accompanying sound effects and music sound effects and music should never be an afterthought you may also wish to include unusual voices in your ad 13 x research source for instance if you are selling a beverage hearing the bottle open can be enticing if you are selling season tickets to a baseball team the crack of the bat and roar of the crowd can grab someone s attention rely on these other elements to enhance your ad research the product or service before you can write effective witty and articulate copy you need to learn the ins and outs of the service or product you are trying to sell as you examine the product or service try to answer to the following questions what is the product used for what does the service entail who manufacturers the product which company or individual provides the service what makes the product or service unique how much does the product or service cost is the service or product only offered for a limited time how do interested customers contact the seller or service provider where is the product sold 14 x research source identify your target audience the tone and content of your radio ad is completely dependent upon your target audience an ad directed at children and parents will not sound the same as an ad targeting teens and young adults you might promote a dance club much differently than you would a life insurance policy when determining the target audience use the following demographics gender race ethnicity average age socio economic status location education sexual orientation relationship status job 15 x research source determine how the product or service will benefit members of the target audience advertisement is the art of convincing people that they need a specific product or service to do this the radio ad must provide an answer for the following questions how will this product or service benefit improve or fill the need of your target audience will it solve a specific problem will it provide them with entertainment will it make them trendy and cool will it save them time and or money will it provide them with information and valuable skills will it help them to get ahead at

how to play strip twister,twister is a great party game and an easy way to burn off steam but if you re not feeling inspired to play traditional twister there are several twists on the old classic you can add to make this game more fun and more adult as long as everyone is game to play strip twister is a great way to bond with your significant other and enjoy some old fashioned physical fun,divide into teams in order to play twister you will need at least two people an equal number of men and women tends to work best divide your players into teams of two people preferably with a man and a woman on each team 1 x research source if you re playing the game with couples each couple can be their own team if you don t have an equal number of players ask one person to serve as the referee and official spinner if you do have an even number of players the referee position will rotate amongst the players if you prefer not to play with teams each player can play on their own individual team prepare to play spread your mat across the floor if you re playing the game outside make sure to anchor the mat at each corner so it doesn t blow away players should start at opposite ends of the mat with each person standing near the word twister each player should begin with one foot on the yellow circle and one foot on the blue circle closest to their side 2 x research source if you re playing with three people set up the players as you would for a two player game then have the third player face the red circle side of the mat with one foot on each of the two middle red circles if you re playing with teams a member of each team will play in each round and eventually the winners of each round will face off in a final match play the game every time the referee spins the spinner they will call out the body part and color the spinner points to each player must place that body part on the corresponding circle a circle must be vacant for a player to be able to use it 3 x research source if a player currently has a body part on a color and that color is called again the player must move to a new circle of that same color if two players reach for the same circle at the same time it is up to the referee to decide who got there first if all six circles of the same color are already covered the referee must spin again until a new color can be called out win the game any player who falls or touches the mat with an elbow or knee will be immediately ejected from the game players may choose to eliminate themselves if they feel they cannot hold a position any longer 4 x research source the player left standing at the end of the game wins if you are playing with teams don t forget to have the winners of each heat face off at the end decide on your clothing rules all players should begin a game of strip twister wearing the same number of clothing articles five or six articles of clothing tends to work best 5 x research source hats socks shoes and jewelry count as clothing articles it is recommended that everyone apply deodorant and play in a well ventilated room for maximum enjoyment review the rules in strip twister any time the spinner lands on red all players must remove an article of clothing only one hand or foot may be lifted from the mat at a time even when the player is removing clothing 6 x research source when removing clothing the hand or foot must be placed back on the spot it originated from before another hand or foot can be lifted if a player falls while removing an article of clothing they must remove an additional item of clothing as a penalty apply penalties since this is twister with a twist there are certain penalties in this game that do not exist in the standard game of twister in regular twister if a player falls they are automatically removed from the game in strip twister they just remove an article of clothing whoever has the most clothing on at the end wins the game 7 x research source anyone who is caught wearing more than the allotted amount of clothing must immediately remove the extra clothing anyone caught cheating in any form will be punished by having to remove an additional article of clothing modify the game to suit your needs if you choose to play strip twister with a larger group you may decide to add additional restrictions to make the game more competitive and more family friendly players may choose to strip down only to their undergarments or bathing suits if the spinner lands on yellow that can also be an automatic strip 8 x research source start out naked naked twister generally works best if you re playing solely with a significant other instead of gradually taking off your clothing throughout the game start naked and up the ante by distracting each other with physical affection 9 x research source try licking nuzzling kissing or tickling your opponent to get them to relinquish their spot on the board 10 x research source make the game more romantic by turning down the lights and adding some candles just make sure not to knock the candles over in the heat of the moment make it a drinking game in drunk twister the game remains the same but each player must take a shot each time they slip on the mat but don t fall the game continues until everyone has fallen or everyone has drunk so much that they can t go on 11 x research source use small shot glasses for drinks otherwise the game may take a dangerous turn you can choose to increase the number of shots a player has to take for each slip for example after the first slip they might take one shot after the second two and so on play oily twister take naked twister one step further by rubbing your opponent down with baby oil before beginning the game play naked twister as you normally would but expect to spend most of the time slipping and sliding across the board 12 x research source in keeping with the theme the loser of oily twister must give the winner a full body massage keep medical supplies handy oily twister has a much higher injury rate than naked twister,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to create your own coat of arms,people who are interested in genealogy will often conduct intense searches to fill in the gaps of their family tree if you are interested in genealogy you may find out that your ancestors had their own coat of arms however you may discover that you are either unable to find your family s coat of arms or perhaps you simply find the idea and symbolism fascinating with an understanding of the elements of a coat of arms and the symbolism behind these designs you can create your own coat of arms,begin by choosing the shape of the shield shields are often shaped like an upside down triangle with a slight curvature of the vertical lines feel free to be creative and change the shape to whatever you desire for some inspiration try experimenting with drawing different shapes or conduct a google search to look up the various shapes of shields the shapes of shields generally represent different eras for example the 11th and 12th centuries used a triangle with curved corners and the early 13th century shaped their shields similar to a guitar pick 1 x research source choose the divisions of the shield divisions refers to how the shield is segmented or what shapes go on the shield for example you may want to section the shield into three parts perhaps you want to add three diamonds horizontally across the shield there are numerous ways to divide the shield when designing your own you can reference classic heraldry or choose your own design 2 x research source choose the shield s color in some cases depending on how you want to display your shield you may use different colors in the various divisions of your shield you can also choose to not divide the shield at all and simply use one color or no colors at all 3 x research source if you choose to use color you could use colors such as bright red royal or sky blue emerald green royal purple black if you choose to go for a metallic shield gold or silver are your best bets select the charges for your shield the designs on the shield are known as charges you can use animals flowers stars crescent moons sunbursts or mythological creatures most animals are shown to be two dimensional meaning that they look flat and only the characteristics that distinguish them as an animal like tails are obvious the most common animals used on shields include lions bears boars eagles horses dragons and griffins choose the colors for your charges traditionally speaking if you chose a metallic color for your shield then you should use a color for your charges and vice versa in classic heraldry different colors symbolize different traits however feel free to use the colors that you would like to use since this is your own design gold or yellow symbolize generosity silver or white represent peace and serenity blue represents truth and loyalty red represents a warrior or military strength green represents hope and joy black represents grief or constancy purple represents royalty or justice orange represents ambition maroon represents patience in battle yet achieving victory 4 x research source decide the posture for your charges the charges on a coat of arm can appear in different postures depending on how you want to represent yourself if your charges are animals or creatures they will appear on your shield as they would naturally standing on their hind legs standing on hind legs face turned toward you walking lying down or sitting charges that are standing are generally regarded as more alert fierce and prepared for battle whereas seated charges generally symbolize peacefulness and serenity choose accessories to add to the outside of your shield lay out the rest of your coat of arms by choosing from the different parts and accessories this could be a crown symbol plants or flowers weaponry or something that you believe symbolizes yourself or your family 5 x research source if you love flowers you could incorporate flower vines or plant designs all around your shield you could incorporate flames for a more powerful vibe decide on the helm the item that sits on top of the shield is the helm for example some people use a coronet which is similar to the pillow that the king s helmet sits on the coronet would rest on the shield you could draw a soft bed of vines or plants or not even draw a helm at all pick a helmet if you choose to use a coronet as part of your crest the helmet will sit on the coronet the can be of almost any style feel free to be creative depending on the style of helmet there may be a crest atop the helmet this crest often includes something like the head of a rooster or stag it varied from family to family and whether the family was of higher peerage there are various styles of helmets that you can draw such as the ancient helmet the ancient roman helmet or the barrel helmet 6 x research source if you are unsure what to draw for a helmet conduct a google search of helmets used in coats of arms and browse through the thousands of websites and images for inspiration pick out your mantling mantling refers to the leaves that usually attach to the top of the helmet or the bottom of the crest these leaves can be from any plant that you choose for example you could choose the leaves of an oak tree to symbolize strength and growth 7 x research source choose your supporters supporters can be animals birds or persons that appear to be supporting or holding up the shield this is an important aspect of the coat of arms as it takes up as much space as the shield itself think about what symbolizes you if you feel like you are a bold strong fiery person you could choose dragons to support your shield if you feel you are quiet and wise you could choose sparrows or another type of bird to support the shield your supporters do not have to be two of the same kind of animal or person for example you could use a lion and a griffin decide if you would like to include a compartment under the shield the compartment usually consists of simple leaves or branches that take up the space between the shield and the banner below you could also try ribbons or bows 8 x research source design your banner the banner is a pretty simple ribbon that displays your motto for the motto you can use an inspirational saying such as believe in yourself and you will be unstoppable or it could have your full name on it remember that the coat of arms represents you so put something on the banner that is meaningful to you you could also use a saying in another language or use a quote you could consult with your family to come up with a statement or saying if you come up with a cool phrase but don t really want to just have it in english you could use google translate to change it to latin which will make it sound even cooler and encourage others to ask about it finish the banner once you have added these last finishing touches look it over to see if there is anything else you would like to add if not sit back and enjoy your new coat of arms,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to attach a camera to a tripod,a tripod is a three legged camera stand that stabilizes your shot using the tripod can help you take sharper photographs even in poor lighting there are many brands and models of tripod on the market but most of them attach to the camera in the same way read on for a basic description of how to attach a camera to a tripod,check that your camera has a tripod mount most modern cameras are tripod capable but some smaller cameras are not the tripod mount is a small hole with screw threads located on the bottom of the camera it is usually about 1 4 inch in diameter if your camera isn t tripod capable you will be unable to mount it to a tripod most small cameras of the point and shoot variety have 1 4 20 unc threads some larger professional cameras may have 3 8 16 unc threads remove the camera plate from your tripod the camera plate is the piece that fixes the camera to the tripod look for a quick release clip or lever that will unlock the camera plate from the main body of the tripod there are many ways to connect a camera to the main body of your tripod however almost all tripods use a detachable camera plate to make it easier to mount your device 1 x research source you don t technically need to detach the mount from the tripod however this step will make it much easier to screw the camera onto the tripod make sure that the plate on the tripod features the same size screw as your camera not every camera is compatible with every camera plate you may be able to buy a new camera plate that fits both your camera and your tripod level the tripod adjust the legs so that they stand stably on the ground release the tensioners on the legs and raise them to the height that you need them you can technically attach a camera to the tripod before you set up the tripod but your camera will be safer if you set up the base first if you extend the legs check that they are securely locked in place before you mount the camera 2 x research source your tripod does not need to be absolutely level it should however be balanced enough that the tilt isn t noticeable leveling is more important if you re taking panoramic shots and stitching multiple frames together into one image some tripods feature a built in bubble level that helps you stabilize the rig otherwise you can always buy or borrow a small level screw the camera onto the tripod the camera might screw directly onto the tripod you might need to clamp it into place and you might need to tighten screws to hold the camera steady look for a threaded hole in the bottom of the camera if your camera screws directly onto the tripod then the camera plate tripod mount should have a matching screw twist the pieces together until they are snugly joined some tripods will have a small screw head on the underside of the plate in this case tighten the screw head from the bottom of the plate instead of twisting the plate itself onto the camera the connection should be snug but not over tight too tight screws can put stress on the mounting system which could in turn damage your camera or tripod 3 x research source clamp the camera to the tripod some tripod heads use a clamping mechanism rather than a simple screw some use a clamp to supplement the screw place the camera gently between the clamps then find the tightening mechanism you will likely need to tighten screws or twist knobs to make the clamps fit the camera adjust until the device is held securely in place re mount the camera plate to the tripod if you removed the camera plate for an easier attaching job make sure to re attach it so that you can use the tripod pull back the quick release lever fit the mounted plate onto the tripod head and release the lever 4 x research source when in doubt simply reverse the steps you took when you detached the camera plate from the tripod take your pictures you should be able to swivel the camera on the tripod for pan shots but you can always move the rig to a more convenient spot before you take any photos look through the viewfinder to check that the lens is angled exactly how you want it make sure that the tripod is level and stable when you shoot 5 x research source make sure that you re using the right camera plate check that the camera plate you re trying to connect to your camera was designed to go with your tripod if you re having difficulty getting the plate to connect with the tripod it may be because the plate and the tripod don t go together most manufacturers have their own connection system you won t be able to mount a camera plate to a tripod if they weren t designed to work together hang your camera bag from the center column of the tripod if you re still having trouble getting a clear picture on unsteady ground try hanging your camera bag or any object of comparable mass from the center column this should make your tripod more stable and it should help minimize the shakes 6 x research source don t attach the camera directly to the legs most professional grade tripods are sold with the legs and tripod head packaged separately this allows photographers to mix and match exactly the gear they re looking for 7 x research source if there is no way to move the camera around on the top of the tripod then you ll need to work around it consider getting a tripod head,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to create a photography portfolio,creating a portfolio of your work is one of the most important things you can do as a photographer whether you want to market yourself commercially or simply create a collection for private use a portfolio allows you the chance to assemble a concise group of images that represents your best work the purpose for your portfolio will play a large role in how you put it together however all portfolios should demonstrate skill level and include a cohesive group of images with a unifying theme by keeping your purpose and intended audience in mind you can assemble an effective portfolio for any objective,identify the purpose of your portfolio 1 x research source this will dictate how you put your portfolio together and what goes in it are you creating it for a job interview are you trying to get your work shown in a gallery are you applying to a college art program maybe it s for a presentation whatever your reason is identify it before you begin deciding what goes into your portfolio is much easier when you have a specific goal in mind for example if the purpose for your portfolio is a job interview your goal would be to demonstrate certain skills and techniques that the job requires on the other hand if your portfolio is for a gallery exhibition your goal would be to demonstrate a clear and cohesive theme that would do well in a gallery setting consider your audience 2 x research source specifying the purpose of your portfolio will give you a solid idea about who your audience is what kind of response or reaction do you want from your audience think about what you want to show them are you trying to challenge them please them impress them or surprise them tailor your content to your audience for example if your portfolio is for a job interview with a cooking magazine your audience will want to see how well you photograph food and what your personal style is perhaps your audience includes owners of an independent art gallery the content you would choose for the magazine editors is much different than the content you would choose for the gallery owners decide on a unifying theme 3 x research source in most cases your portfolio doesn t need to showcase the best of your entire body of work instead settle on a concept that will unify a strong series of images this will result in a more cohesive and effective portfolio the theme can be anything you want you could focus on images depicting a specific subject matter a certain style or photos taken with a particular kind of camera for example for an artistic purpose you could limit your portfolio to crisp black and white photography only if you re trying to get a job as real estate photographer your theme could be dynamic images taken of various kinds of buildings choose a portfolio format whether you go with a print or a digital portfolio is entirely up to you keep your audience in mind when you make your decision for instance gallery owners and traditional artists might prefer to see a beautifully bound print portfolio on the other hand people affiliated with industries like media and advertisement may want to see your work presented digitally you always have the option of creating both as well an electronic format can help you emphasize different aspects of your work than a printed format can and vice versa go through your body of work at this point you ve defined your purpose your goal the audience and the unifying theme as you go through possible photos for the portfolio keep these things firmly in mind set aside all of the images that meet the criteria you ve established don t worry about making any final decisions now just ask yourself if each photo meets the criteria or not sort the images into a yes and no pile assess the quality of each photo individually 4 x research source as you examine each image think about whether or not it represents your chosen concept is the image strong enough to stand on its own without explanation when viewed with other images is it just as strong does it adequately display your mastery of the medium is it consistent with your main body of work be consistent as you narrow it down further keep in mind that the images you choose need to be consistent in format in most cases the final set should not be a mix of horizontal and vertical images be consistent with one or the other 5 x research source the style should also be consistent throughout for example your portfolio shouldn t jump back and forth between crisp black and white shots and dreamy images printed in color remove any flawed or repetitive images 6 x research source get rid of images that are out of focus or that have visible flaws it s better to have a small number of exceptional shots than a large group of decent ones avoid including too many images that look very similar to one another you need to include a variety of images that explore your theme for example your portfolio shouldn t consist of images that were all shot during the same session being able to weed out flawed and redundant images shows that you are able to properly evaluate your own work with a critical eye 7 x research source get the opinion of someone you trust 8 x research source it s important to be able to evaluate your own work critically but it will be difficult to be completely objective be as objective as you can but consider getting an impartial opinion from someone you trust bring this person in when you re in the final stages of selection don t reveal your concept or give the person any information upfront see if they can pinpoint what you re going for without being told request that they provide as much feedback as possible and take notes if you need to settle on ten to twenty final images 9 x research source there isn t a specific number of images a portfolio should include and opinions about this tend to vary however most professionals agree that less is more twenty images should be the maximum closer to ten is preferable remember each of these shots should strongly represent your skill level the execution of each shot should be close to perfect and there should be no visible flaws in any of them tweak your final images if necessary examine your set closely think about any steps you need to take to perfect your chosen images perhaps you need to tweak a negative for a better print or crop something slightly differently complete the computer or darkroom work necessary to finalize your series of photos as you tweak the images don t forget that a consistent theme should be apparent and the series of images should fit together in a cohesive way don t change the images so much that you lose cohesiveness organize the images into a particular sequence 10 x research source there is no right way to order your images however the first image in your portfolio should be one of the strongest you want the first photo to make a clear statement it also needs to create enough interest to make the viewer want to continue looking through the series arrange the rest so that the colors tones and moods compliment and play off one another it might help to think about arranging them in a way that tells a coherent story or evokes a particular mood the final image should appropriately sum up the rest of the series avoid crowding the best images at the front and then padding the end out with weaker images there should be no weak images in the group use high quality materials your portfolio is more than just a handful of great photos the way you present them is extremely important a bound book of selected works is the most traditional option the book you arrange them in should represent the contents inside choose techniques borders and backing sheet colors that enhance the collection make your prints on good paper be consistent and choose either matte or glossy do not include a combination package everything as attractively and professionally as you can put the photos into your portfolio most artists prefer to do this themselves they either mount the photos onto backing paper or they slide the images into the plastic sleeves that their purchased portfolio provides if you d prefer to have a professional do this part research your area for shops that do custom printing the photos should be placed into the portfolio in the sequence you worked out earlier you can arrange one image per page or you could cluster two or three photos together to create a chapter remember the sequence should make sense tell a story with your images add the finishing touches 11 x research source the amount of additional information you include in your portfolio is up to you consider adding final elements such as an artist statement a title list of the photographs in the portfolio or a cover image that represents the portfolio as a whole you want the images to stand alone and speak for themselves but there is nothing wrong with including additional information that may enhance the portfolio consider an online portfolio digital portfolios are becoming more common especially in technology and media fields there are two options creating your own website or using a portfolio hosting site like smugmug or zenfolio unless you are prepared to buy web space and create a website from scratch the hosting site is a better option these sites let you upload your photos into galleries and then you can customize the order and the appearance 12 x research source digital portfolios can be updated frequently whereas a print portfolio is usually a finished work online you can add and take away images and continually customize your portfolio you should still try to keep your chosen images concise but with digital portfolios it s acceptable to display a few more images than a print one would 20 30 is a good number,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a pilot hole,learning how to drill pilot holes properly is an essential part of working with wood a pilot hole is a small hole drilled before driving a screw into a piece of wood the hole helps in multiple ways it prevents the screw from splitting the wood it allows for easier installation in dense hardwoods and it ensures that the screw will be installed straight because it will follow the path of the pilot hole before attempting a woodworking project of any magnitude you should learn how to make a pilot hole,mark the location of your intended hole with a pencil if it is crucial that the screw is installed in a precise location you may want to mark the spot with a pencil on the material use a ruler to determine your intended location usually by measuring the distance from the edge of the material s surface tracing along the ruler with a pencil at the desired distance along the line you drew make a small mark with the pencil create an indentation using a center punch a punch is a small slender tool with a pointed end that allows you to create a small indentation in the work surface this indentation will help keep your drill bit from slipping when starting the pilot hole position the tip of the punch over your pencil mark and then strike the punch gently with a hammer determine the appropriate size bit for drilling your pilot hole as a general rule of thumb your pilot hole should be slightly smaller than the diameter of your screw this will remove as much material as possible which will reduce the likelihood of splitting but will still leave enough material for the screw s threads to grip into exact recommendations for pilot hole diameters based on screw sizes can be looked up online however a visual check of your drill bit against the screw will suffice for most applications it is best to err on the smaller side when choosing a bit a pilot hole can always be made bigger but not smaller drill the pilot hole after choosing a bit and fitting it into your drill position the tip of the bit into the indentation you created with the center punch holding the bit at the angle you want the screw positioned drill the hole to a depth equal to the screw s length back the bit out carefully install the screw once the pilot hole is drilled you can install the screw fit your drill with a screwdriver bit and position the screw s tip into the pilot hole drive the screw in being careful to angle it to follow the path of the hole repeat this process for each screw used,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to fly a kite,flying kites is a fun way to spend a windy spring or summer afternoon if you are a beginner start with a single line delta or diamond kite if you are looking for a challenge then try a dual string box or parafoil kite always fly your kite in open spaces away from trees and power lines if you are having trouble getting your kite in the air then have a friend hold up the kite for you,try a delta or diamond kite look for kites that are shaped like triangles or diamonds these are the delta and diamond kites because they are relatively easy to fly these two types of kites are great for beginners they fly well in light to medium winds about 6 to 15 mph winds 1 x research source choose a single line kite look for kites with a single string these are single line kites because they are easier to control single line kites are recommended for beginners single line kites are most suitable for light to medium winds however if you want to fly your single line kite in stronger winds then add a tail to it 2 x research source when choosing a tail for your kite choose one that is made of lightweight materials select a box or parafoil kite look for kites that are shaped like a four dimensional box sled or arch these are parafoil kites choose one of these kites if you want something a little more challenging than the delta or diamond kite they need stronger winds to fly about 8 to 25 mph winds 3 x research source parafoil kites usually contain tunnel like passage ways for wind to pass through try a dual line kite look for kites with two strings these are dual line kites dual line kites also known as sport or stunt kites require more experience to fly you can fly dual line kites in light moderate and heavy winds additionally with two lines the flier has more control over the kite 4 x research source you can also do maneuvers and tricks like loops with dual line kites visit your local discount retailer your local discount retailer should have a variety of kites available for you to choose from if you cannot find the kite you are looking for then visit specialty kite stores online 5 x research source fly your kite in 5 to 25 mph winds this wind speed works for most kites although medium speed winds are ideal it will be difficult to fly a kite in winds that are either slower or faster than this speed check the weather app on your phone or computer to see how fast the winds are blowing on a given day 6 x research source you can also look at the tops of trees bushes and the leaves to see how fast the wind is blowing for example when the wind is able to move leaves off of the ground the flying conditions are ideal choose big open spaces to fly your kite parks the beach and open fields are great places to fly a kite try to avoid flying your kite near power lines buildings roads airports and trees additionally if you are flying a dual line kite create distance between yourself and other people in the park and make sure others know to stand behind you 7 x research source remember that the more space you have the more line you can let out and the higher your kite will fly avoid flying your kite in rain and lightning the electricity in rain clouds is attracted to wet kite lines to avoid getting shocked never fly your kite in a rain or thunderstorm 8 x research source assemble your kite indoors insert the spine and crossbars and attach the string per the instruction manual make sure to check the guidelines to determine the ideal wind speed for the kite 9 x research source face away from the wind hold up your kite by the bridle the bridle is the two or three strings that attach to the kite and the kite line hold it up until it catches the wind 10 x research source let out some line as soon as your kite catches the wind let go of the bridle and begin to let some line out the line should not be slack but taut with a little give pull on the line to point the kite up this will help the kite climb higher into the air 11 x research source use a friend if the wind is light tell your friend to hold the kite and walk downwind about 50 to 100 feet away from you have them hold the kite up in the air in front of them once the wind picks up signal your friend to release the kite as the kite gains altitude pull on the line hand over hand until it is stable 12 x research source adjust the bridle if your kite sinks then this means there is not enough wind if you can lower the bridle half of an inch down if your kite nose dives or spins toward the ground then the wind is too strong in this case move the bridle a half inch higher 13 x research source reel in your line do this slowly to land your kite as you reel it in make sure the line is taut with a little give as you reel in your line walk toward your kite until it has landed safely on the ground 14 x research source if your kite starts to spin then the line is too taut you will need to give it some slack by letting out the line assemble the kite inside insert the spine into the slot at the nose i e the tip of the kite attach the upper and lower spreaders to their connecting pieces on the leading edges connect the standoffs to the trailing edges make sure to attach the flying lines with a slip knot 15 x research source stand with your back toward the wind place your kite on the ground the bottom of the kite should be facing up the bottom of the kite is the side where the kite strings attach to the kite 16 x research source alternatively have a friend hold the kite up in the air for you walk backward as you walk backward slowly let the line out make sure the lines are the same length as well as straight and not twisted or tangled as you walk backward pull the handles to your sides this will help the kite catch the wind 17 x research source if a friend is holding up the kite have them toss it up in the air once you have walked about 30 to 50 feet backward pull gently on the lines do this to elevate the kite higher the line should be taut with a little give but not slack if your kite begins to descend then reel the line in a little bit and gently pull until it starts going back up 18 x research source land your kite fly your kite to the side or edge of the wind at this point your kite should be at an angle relative to the wind as opposed to perpendicular slowly walk toward your kite to bring it safely to the ground 19 x

how to make a cantenna,this article explains how to make an inexpensive homemade cantenna a cantenna is an antenna made from a can that can amplify wifi signals from 5 22db in most cases the cantenna also makes it possible to increase the distance of many wireless networks in addition there are many websites that can help you design and see examples of homemade cantennas,find a can that is no more than 4 inches 10 2 cm wide in diameter ideal diameter is 3 25 to 3 75 inches 8 3 to 9 5 cm a progresso soup can is a good start since these are directional antennas a longer can will increase range but they decrease the angle of sweep this helps eliminate interference but requires you to point it more accurately 6 to 10 inches 15 2 to 25 4 cm long will improve signal strength gain you may be able to solder several cans together to improve performance use the table below to calculate how far you will drill the hole for placement of an n type female chassis mount connector if you use a single progresso soup can its easy count the total number of ribs and punch the hole at exactly the center rib one side is n female for connecting the cable from your wireless equipment and the other side has a small brass stub for soldering on wire these can be found at electronics stores internet suppliers the wire you solder should be exactly 1 21 inches 3 1 cm tall just a hair under 1 1 4 inches sticking up inside the can you may find soldering or using a small torch melts the plastic insulator in the connector if so remove the brass stem from the melted puddle of plastic use a small torch to solder the wire into the brass stem then wrap it the brass stem with 10 20 turns of black tape and re insert it snuggly into the adapter leaving the 1 21 inches 3 1 cm of copper wire exposed drill a hole in the can at the correct position according to your calculation or the center rib of a progresso soup can since tin cans rip easily a hole saw will make a mess use a small drill bit and then slowly widen the hole slowly with a rat tail file a brad point drill bit or hole saw held with pliers or vice grips slowly working it back and forth a power drill and a big bit will likely to destroy the can or make a poor hole widen the hole to accommodate the adapter place the adapter in the hole and secure to the can instead of drilling holes and screwing the adapter to the can you can get a bit of rubber garden hose about 3 8 long slip it over the outside end of the adapter and as you tighten the cable the hose compresses against the can and locks the adapter in place attach a pigtail cable to the adapter a pigtail is a wire that attaches the adapter to the computer s wifi card note you must have a compatible wifi adapter to make this work one problem with pigtails is the wires are very thin and they just don t last long a reliable long lasting alternative is to go to an electronic store and assemble 2 or 3 bnc or bnc reversed connectors eliminating wire problems this makes the antenna easily detachable from the usb wifi card with a simple twist lock connect the cantenna and wifi card with the pigtail or bnc connectors tape cantenna to tripod or create a small portable stand or clamp with a bit of thick wire that loops around the bnc connectors and can be easily removed and allows you to rotate the cantenna to find signals aim at source and adjust to get the best signal this should be much stronger than the whip antenna you had before to improve the signal even more much more cut a 2 foot 0 6 m wide by 1 foot 0 3 m high sheet of concrete lathing screen with 1 4 inch 0 6 cm or smaller holes and curve it slightly to form a parabolic dish similar to a tv satellite dish instead of pointing the can at the signal source point it at your screen which points at the signal so the back of the can points at the signal it takes a bit of adjusting to get the curve of the screen and distance to the can exactly right you can find formulas for calculating the exact focal point or use trial and error since you will see your signal gain double or even triple when you get the curve and distance just right you can then make a wooden or aluminum frame to hold everything together in the right position you can also use a real satellite dish and place the cantenna at the end of the arm at the position the tv antennas the horn usually go finished,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build a playhouse,a child s playhouse is a wonderful place for creative play building a playhouse is a great family project that everyone will enjoy participating in your children will love having their own playhouse and will delight in planning and decorating their house with you follow these steps to learn how you can build a playhouse,gather your materials this is the most extensive and time consuming method of building a playhouse but it offers the best results there is quite a long list of supplies though so make sure you have gathered them all before you start building 1 x research source the materials you will need include 2x8 boards 2x4 boards ¾ plywood 3 galvanized screws 1 x6 decking planks wood siding quarter round molding shingles and roofing nails you will need an assortment of tools including a circular saw a jigsaw a reciprocating saw a drill a level a framing square a hammer a straight edge a utility knife and tape measure an option is to include plexiglass to create real windows rather than open air spaces in your playhouse choose a location the playhouse will measure 6x8 feet and will need at least that much space plus a little extra room for an entrance this playhouse is meant to be outdoors but could certainly be placed indoors if you desired 2 x research source create the base to build the base of the playhouse you will be using your 2x8 boards and then covering it with the decking planks this base will form the platform for the playhouse to sit on and will also prove a 2 porch in front of the entrance 3 x research source form a 6x8 foot rectangle by measuring and cutting your 2x8 foot boards cut the two side boards to be one inch short so that they can fit between the two longest boards perfectly use your 3 screws to butt joint the boards together creating an empty rectangle to add stability to the floor use an additional two 2x8 foot boards to create floor joists these should be cut to fit the space running lengthwise in the center floor making the base four boards running the distance of 8 feet 2 4 m and two boards on the ends running 6 feet 1 8 m use your three inch screws to secure these to the sides to cover the foundation and create the floor measure and cut your 1 x6 deck planking to fit the base widthwise the shorter distance use enough that they cover the entirety of the base with no spaces between each board use your 3 screws to make sure they are completely attached cut off any excess boards with your circular saw create the wall frames to build the walls of the playhouse you must first make empty frames for the sides to attach to measure 1 in on the perimeter of the base because the wall frames will sit on the floor rather than being attached to the outside 4 x research source to make the back frame first measure the boards which will create the top and bottom these should be cut from your 2x4 boards and measure 7 11 so that it doesn t overlap the edge of the floor then take five 2x4 boards and measure them to 3 9 so that they will join evenly with the other frames without overlapping the desired 4 width attach two of the 3 9 boards to the edges of the two 7 11 boards creating an empty rectangle then add in the three support beams to the center of the rectangle evenly spaced between them to create four smaller empty sections create the front wall frame by doing the same process explained above in making the back wall frame in addition to that add a cross board six inches below the topmost board between your choice of two studs this will create the frame for the door make the side walls by taking your 2x4 boards and cutting four of them two for each side wall to a length of 3 9 take four additional 2x4 boards and cut them to be 3 4 for the top and bottom of the sides use your galvanized screws to attach these creating two rectangular sides for each side cut two 3 9 boards to add to the center of the frames for support add these to the centers of each side frame and attach them with the screws in each of the side frames measure 9 from the top and bottom and add a board to fit between the studs here this will create the frame for two side windows attach the wall frames to the base starting with the back wall stand it upright on the edge of the baseboards use multiple galvanized screws to secure it to the floor then move to the side walls attach these to the floor first and then to the edges of the rear wall with more screws the last wall to be added is the front wall remember this one will have a two foot space in front for a porch screw it into the floor and then to the two sides making sure that it fits smoothly with the other wall frames 5 x research source build the roof once the wall frames are firmly attached to the floor you can move onto making the roof for the playhouse to do this first create a frame and then cover it with plywood 6 x research source measure the ridgeboard the board that will run lengthwise through the center of the triangle shaped roof to 7 11 cut the struts the supportive edge of the roof out of 2x4 boards to 14 long miter these to the correct angle to fit against the ridgeboard and the top of the wall frames create the eight rafters made from 2x4 inch boards you will use four of each of these boards in the centers of the roof between the struts to give support to the roof miter these to fit the angle of the ridgeboard and the top of the wall frames begin by attaching the struts to the ridgeboard and then add the rafters attach this roof frame to the tops of the wall frames there should be two empty isosceles triangle shapes at the ends of the frame above the two side walls cut plywood to fit the roof you will attach shingles to the top of the plywood so make sure the entirety of the roof frame is covered excluding the side triangles screw these pieces to the top of the frame once you ve gotten the correct measurements screw the rafter and struts to the frame directly above the studs to add extra support to your playhouse structure finish the walls use your wood siding to add the outer edge to your walls measure the wall frames to make sure you get the correct size and then cut the wood to fit the two side pieces should be in the shape of a pentagon to include the triangle shapes formed by the roof screw the walls into the frame along the support beams mark out the space for the windows and door use a jigsaw to cut out these pieces sanding the rough edges when you finish if you chose to use plexiglass for the windows insert them now finish the windows with or without the plexiglass with the quarter round molding around the edges shingle the roof line up the first row of shingles along the edge and then have all adjacent rows of shingles slightly overlap each other use four roofing nails per shingle to attach them to the plywood roof because the ridge board will be exposed cut the sheets of shingles into individual pieces and turn them sideways nail them to the ridge board so that the entire roof is covered use your utility knife to cut off any excess shingles 7 x research source finish your playhouse at this point the building process of your playhouse has been completed now you can add the finishing touches to it to make it unique paint the outside add window box planters and put small sized furniture inside enjoy your completed playhouse gather your supplies you will need seven 10 foot 3 0 m ¾ pvc pipes ten converter pieces a pvc pipe cutter and fabric and a sewing kit or sewing machine to create the cover the ten converter pipe pieces all need to measure ¾ you will need four t s four 45 degree angle elbows and ten 3 way connectors to get fabric that will be big enough to cover the entire playhouse without spending a lot of money buy sheets or unlined curtains you can buy these new or find them used and give them a good washing before use 8 x research source you may choose to use ribbons to sew to the inside of the fabric so that the tent portion can be tied on and removed to be washed whenever you desire create the frame the frame will consist of a base and a top four supporting beams and a triangular roof piece they will be put together 9 x research source to create the base and the top cut the pipe into four pieces that measure 6 feet 1 8 m long and four pieces that measure 4 feet 1 2 m long connect them into two large separate rectangles with the 3 way connectors on each corner slide a t shaped connector facing upwards on each of the four corners of the top piece for the roof to connect to you may have to cut 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm off the pipe to make room for these connectors to connect to the corners create the support beams to form the walls these can be cut at your discretion to meet your preferred ceiling height you will need to cut four pieces of pipe all of an equal length attach them to the two corner slots at the top and bottom of the pipe forming a large empty cube make the roof to do this cut four additional pieces of pipe the same length as the sides fit them together at a right 90 degree angle creating two large l shapes you will need to use the 3 way corners to fit them then cut another piece of pipe 6 feet 1 8 m long and run this down the center between the two l s attach the entire roof structure to the base by putting them in the t shaped slots on the top rectangle make sure all the connections between the pipes are strong and you are finished with the structure make the tent covering using the fabric you got take a measurement of all the sides and the roof cut these pieces and use a sewing machine to stitch all the sides together in the same shape as your playhouse 10 x research source it may be easier to attach the tent to the playhouse if you make it a little larger than the real size this way slipping it over the pipes and removing it for cleaning will be a cinch sew 6 inch ribbons to the inside of the tent perpendicular to the seams so that when the tent is placed on the pipe frame they can be tied on to allow movement cut a slit from the bottom till ¾ of the way up one of the sides to create a tent flap style door if you want you can cut holes in the sides to act as windows feel free to use a thick clear plastic as play glass to fill these holes slide the tent over the pipes once you have completely sewn the tent pieces together you are finished this can be used indoors or outdoors and the fabric covering can easily be removed to wash gather your supplies for this project you can choose to use a table that is of use in your house or to procure a table especially for this project you will also need several yards of fabric enough to cover all sides of the table scissors and decorations optional measure your table in order to get an accurate cover for your table you must have a list of all the measurements take a measurement of the length width and height make sure to write these down to keep track of them measure your fabric you will be making the playhouse out of five pieces of fabric you need one to fit the top of the table length x width two to fit the long sides length x height and two to fit the short sides width x height when you ve gotten all the measurements done cut the pieces of fabric out at this point cut out rectangular sections to act as windows and doors in the playhouse these can be as numerous as you desire placed wherever you want sew the fabric pieces together lay the pieces of fabric out in their correct shape order on the floor to make sure you are sewing them correctly they should make a large cross like shape then use a sewing machine to stitch the fabric together along the seams decorate the fabric if you want your playhouse look a little bit more exciting than just some fabric over a table use sharpies embroidery floss or other pieces of fabric to give the fabric the appearance of a house draw on gingerbread trim flower boxes under the windows and a wood grain texture on the walls finish off your playhouse when you have done all the decorating you desire throw the fabric tent over the table to complete your playhouse feel free to fill the inside with small pieces of furniture or toys and enjoy 11 x research source gather your materials for this you will need 1 2 large cardboard boxes all purpose glue wrapping paper or wallpaper packing tape and a box cutter or scissors 12 x research source prepare your box start by cutting off extraneous pieces so that the box lies upside down on the ground and has no bottom or top if it is right side up tape all the seams and loose areas to make sure that it won t fall apart add color to the sides to give your playhouse a better appearance than just a cardboard box cover the sides one at a time with an all purpose glue and a wrapping paper or wallpaper of your choice 13 x research source cut out the doors and windows use a box cutter or scissors to cut a small door from the bottom of one of the sides and as many windows as you would like you can choose to cut only three sides of the door leaving one hinged side attached so that the door can be open and closed instead of just an empty space you can add clear plastic or cellophane on the inside of the box to give the appearance of windows on the outside create a roof to do this cut two large triangle pieces of cardboard out from another box or a spare piece making them the width of the house then cut out two large rectangles the same length as the box and height as the triangles attach the four roof pieces together with glue and tape cut out cardboard shingles in small rectangles or semi circles and glue these in an overlapping pattern over the top of the triangle cut off any extras that go over the edge if you want you can use spray paint to give the roof a bit of color put your house together once the roof is finished glue and tape it to the top of the cardboard box you are finished feel free to add any further decorative touches or enjoy it as is 14 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to host your own talk radio show,have you ever been listening to your favorite morning show dj during your daily commute and thought to yourself this seems easy i can do this while radio broadcasting can be a rewarding way to make a name for yourself and affect the lives of thousands or even millions of listeners it s not always easy hosting a radio talk show once meant paying your dues for years as a low level radio employee today however the internet has given talented amateurs the chance to make a name for themselves to learn how to host your own talk radio show see step 1 below to get started,get involved with a local station if you re starting with zero experience the best way bar none to get any sort of radio show is to start participating in the process of creating an existing radio show working or volunteering in a radio station gives you an introduction to the workflow and regular tasks that go into producing a successful radio show it also gives you much needed experience to put on your resume when you re applying for airtime most importantly it gives you a chance to make contacts inside the station knowing someone in the industry can make all the difference in the world when it comes to landing your first show radio station staff are much much more likely to hire people they know and trust to be show hosts than they are to hire strangers one great idea for building up your radio station experience is to try volunteering for a local community radio station like for instance a college radio station these stations are usually not operated for profit and depend on the work of volunteers to stay on the air which means it can be relatively easy to find a place on the staff compared to a for profit station get an internship some radio stations offer internships and apprenticeships to interested applicants especially young students some of these internships are integrated with a local school or college s communications department which means that they usually recruit solely from the pool of students in the department while other internships may accept applicants from the general public depending on the amount of time you work an internship can sometimes be more useful for getting a show than working from the bottom up in the station good internships are career focused and offer opportunities for employment after the completion of the internship however even with an internship it may be necessary to work in the radio industry for several years before getting a show if possible get a broadcasting education following the correct educational path for becoming a radio host will only help your chances of getting your own show also as noted above educational programs often pave the way for valuable internship and apprenticeship opportunities if it s financially feasible for you to do so consider earning a degree in communications or broadcasting to boost your resume and give you valuable background knowledge and experience it s worth noting that an educational background in communications or broadcasting isn t absolutely necessary for a successful career in radio several of the most recognizable names in radio like howard stern have communications degrees but others have no pertinent educational background for instance adam carolla one time host of loveline and the adam carolla show completed only a partial junior college education which included work in a ceramics major 1 x research source be prepared to pay for time on for profit stations though all stations will have their own rules for their show hosts generally local for profit stations will charge the hosts for their show time 2 x research source times where listener numbers are high like morning and afternoon commute times are generally expensive while less popular times are generally cheaper the hosts can pay for their shows with their own money solicit donations from viewers or sell advertising time to third parties if they make more money from advertising fees than it costs to keep the show on the air they generally keep the difference as a profit successful radio hosts can support themselves this way understanding ahead of time that you may need to pay for your show time is crucial you don t want to pursue a coveted time slot only to find out that you can t afford to run your show because of the cost of hosting a radio show it s often a wise idea to retain another job at least until you can generate enough advertising revenue to support your show dedicating yourself full time to your radio career is great for your show but not if you run out of funds and have to go off the air in a few months costs vary for instance at some local stations radio time can cost anywhere from 60 200 per hour depending on the time slot consider starting with internet radio for first timers to the world of radio broadcasting the internet offers a way to get your voice hear with very few if any up front costs and no experience requirements if you have the computer know how you may want to set up a dedicated audio stream to broadcast your show see how to stream live audio or an online guide like the one here you may also want to try a cheap or free online broadcasting service like live365 com cheap free trial or radionomy com free for 9 months with conditions the downside of having an internet radio show is that it s basically up to you to promote your own show and grow your audience you won t have the resources of an established station to help you another great option is to record a regular podcast podcasts are essentially pre recorded talk radio shows that listeners can download and listen to as they please for more information on podcasts see how to start your own podcast or scroll down to the podcasting section below pick a theme or format for your show before you start broadcasting you ll want to have decided on a purpose for your show while many shows are remarkably flexible in terms of their structure and the topics they cover in general most successful talk shows have a pre defined theme or goal this can be quite broad so don t feel the need to pigeon hole your show with an extremely specific theme simply ask yourself what is my show about below are a few common talk radio show themes to get you started news current events political commentary music news underground music discussion humor parody educational topics history science etc advice relationships diy projects etc niche topics paranormal conspiracy theories etc schedule out your show s time beforehand don t wing it in the studio unless you re an experienced broadcaster scheduling or blocking out the time you have available for your show is a must especially if it s your first show having a plan beforehand allows you to keep the momentum of the show high and makes it harder for you to run out of things to talk about during your first few shows you ll inevitably discover that your schedule doesn t perfectly match with reality some segments may take longer than you anticipated while others take less time take note of these differences and adjust your schedule as needed let s say that we ve just gotten our first 90 minute political talk radio show here s an example of a schedule we might have for our first show 5 minutes theme song and introductions 20 minutes guest interview author jane smith 15 minutes discussion topic 1 minimum wage too high or too low 5 minutes ads 10 minutes take calls 15 minutes discussion topic 2 gerrymandering how big of problem is it in the modern age 5 minutes ads 10 minutes take calls 5 minutes allow guest to plug upcoming events follow with farewell and outro music have a consistent recognizable structure when it comes to talk radio consistency is key listeners want to be confident that they ll be able to hear the same content and style of discussions whenever they tune into your show some change may be unavoidable for instance if a particular aspect of your show isn t working out it s better to drop it than allow it to limp along as an unpopular part of the show however whenever possible you ll want to keep the basics of your schedule the same from one show to the next while allowing for fresh content in the form of new segments and so on invite new guests and old favorites to participate in your show one way to keep your show fresh and interesting while keeping its format consistent is to continuously invite interesting exciting guests on to your show guests bring their own knowledge and conversational style to the show contributing to enlightening or at least entertaining discussions usually in exchange for coming on the show the guest is allowed to promote his or her personal projects on air the types of guests you should invite will vary based on the format of your show for instance if you re running a serious art criticism talk show you might invite guests who offer new perspectives and unique expertise like professors and artists on the other hand if you re hosting a crass shock jock comedy show you might want to invite fellow comedians or even bizarre local personalities take calls from listeners it s almost always a good idea to encourage a friendly open atmosphere between yourself and your callers if you ve got an active audience it s easier to keep the momentum of your show s dialog high than if you don t opening up your phone line to callers allows you to briefly take a break from thinking up new interesting avenues of discussion instead you can let your listeners direct the conversation for you all you have to do is respond if you re on a station with rules against profanity be on the lookout for prank callers always know how to quickly disconnect a call if your station operates on a time delay be aware of how to delete the last few seconds of airtime in the event that a caller says something inappropriate most stations will have an easily accessible delay button somewhere near the main sound board if you re broadcasting online you may want to experiment with taking callers via voicechat software like skype otherwise you may want to have a text chat channel for your listeners which you occasionally monitor for relevant discussion avoid dead air whether you ve got a show on community radio with a tiny local audience or a nationally syndicated morning show you ll want to follow the golden rule of radio broadcasting avoid dead air distracting periods of silence ordinary pauses in conversation are one thing you don t need to be talking for every single second of your show however you will want to avoid stretches of silence that are more than a few seconds long these are awkward to listen to sound unprofessional and can lead to an immediate dip in listenership if it sounds like you re having a technical error you may find that it s a good idea to keep a piece of new music or a similar audio clip queued up and ready to play in the event that something takes you by surprise and you need a few minutes of time seek out advertisers as noted above it s a very real possibility that you may have to pay for your show s airtime to help pay for your show try to find advertisers who are willing to put up a little money to have their message broadcast on air advertisers can pay you a fee or agree to cover some of the costs of your show in exchange for you dedicating a chunk of your airtime to ads some radio show hosts read the advertiser s ad themselves while others opt to play pre recorded ads generally rates for radio advertising increase with the length of the ad the desirability of the time slot and the number of listeners to the show ad prices can also vary greatly by market for instance 60 ads in a market like los angeles can cost up to 500 while the same number of ads might go for as little as 3 in a small rural town 3 x research source don t forget to promote your show never forget that as a radio show host you live and die by your listeners the more listeners you have the better with more listeners you can charge your advertisers more per ad negotiate more lucrative deals with your station and promote yourself and your guests to a wider audience so always be trying to increase your listenership by promoting your show one great way to do this is by advertising on other shows especially those in desirable time slots that broadcast from the same station as you many stations offer a reduced in house rate for cross promoting your show consider recruiting a co host for talk radio shows having a second or third or fourth person in the studio with you every show makes your job easier in just about every way imaginable most importantly co hosts offer their own unique personality and thoughts to every discussion you have ensuring that your own voice and views don t get stale it also allows you to have friendly debate the back and forth between a pair of co hosts who can lovingly bicker is often one of the most entertaining parts of a talk show if you re thinking of getting a co host make sure it s someone you get along with and who understands the commitments of the job co hosts have other benefits too for instance some may be willing to split the cost of airtime with you or help search for and book guests schedule regular features for the listener some of the fun of listening to their favorite shows is from anticipating listening to and even participating in their favorite recurring features as long as you obey the rules of your station and of course local laws there s virtually no limit when it comes to what sorts of segments you can run so be creative below are just a few ideas to get you started call in trivia contests for prizes or recognition live or pre recorded man on the street segments 100th caller wins type contests soliciting listeners for certain types of stories on air creative comedy improv exercises create memorable one off segments just because your viewers are likely to appreciate the consistency of recurring segments doesn t mean that you should necessarily shy away from special one time events and features experimenting with new ideas while keeping the basic format and structure of your show intact allows you to continually innovate and surprise your audience it s also a good way to find new directions for the show to go in anything that gets an especially good reaction can eventually be made a recurring segment build a relationship with frequent contributors if you notice that certain people seem to call in to the station on a regular basis or that certain guests seem especially popular with your listeners don t let these people go to waste instead try to create a friendly working relationship with them talk to these people off the air and ask if they d like to become a regular part of the show even if they aren t interested in joining the show as a dedicated cast member they may appreciate being made a friend of the show or gaining recognition as an official contributor for instance if one of your callers has a boisterous outrageous personality and insane political beliefs you may want to have a semi regular segment where he calls in and comments on the issues of the day create an on air persona some talk radio shows especially those that examine or critique serious topics are dignified affairs however many talk shows are known for the exaggerated crass or outlandish characters assumed by their hosts if your show is mainly interested in entertaining your listeners consider creating such a character for yourself the interplay between a crazy host character and a straightman co host or an unwitting caller can make for great radio when in doubt learn from the greats no one s radio show is perfect from the get go it can take years of experience to develop your broadcast craft to the point that you can deliver a great show every day during this time it s a great idea to look to some of the best radio shows and podcasts in the world for inspiration there s no shame in getting ideas from those who are already successful they too had role models in the world of broadcasting before they became famous for instance howard stern cites radio host bob grant as an influence 4 x research source below are a few great radio shows and podcasts you may want to consider listening to this american life politics serious issues human interest stories the howard stern show shock jock style raunchy humor the ron and fez show humor chat car talk no longer running automotive advice comedy bang bang podcast absurdist comedy improv the bugle podcast news politics record your show to the listener the difference between a radio talk show and a podcast is minor both involve listening to a host and or a set of co hosts talk about familiar subjects with or without a guest however for you the host recording a podcast is a little different than recording a live show you ll perform your show basically as you normally would but rather than broadcasting it live you ll record it and offer it for download on the internet to do this you ll need to an equipment setup that allows you to record reasonably high quality audio files and sufficient hard drive space to store them for the most basic podcasting needs you can get away with a computer and a reasonable quality microphone which usually run upwards of 100 at audio equipment stores edit your audio file after recording your show you may want to listen to your audio file and if necessary cut out any portions that you don t want to make the final podcast to do this you ll need audio editing software some free programs like audacity are available online insert ads intro and outro music or anything else you d to add to your podcast when you re done save your file in a widely used audio format that will be easy for your audience to use like mp3 upload your show to a hosting site make your podcast available to your listeners online a variety of free hosting sites like youtube com soundcloud com and many others allow you to upload audio files with a free account note that with these sites per file bandwidth limits may require you to split your podcast into multiple parts you may also want to try hosting your podcast on online audio stores like the itunes store google play store and so on generally most podcasts are offered to the listener for free and are supported by donations sponsors or advertisers charging money for your podcast can decimate your potential listenership when you re competing against literally hundreds of good free podcasts so it s not usually a good idea optionally create a blog or website for your podcast generally the most professional podcasts have their own websites which contain links to the podcast episodes as well as podcast news a store for merchandise and so on you may want to purchase your own domain name and build your site from scratch but for many a free blog creation service like wordpress com works perfectly well for more information see how to make a website,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to play chopsticks,chopsticks is a game of strategy as well as basic math it has roots in japan and can also called finger chess swords split magic fingers chinese fingers cherries sticks and twiddly dinks though there are many variations of rules and different names the overall theory and spirit of the game remains the same this game is not the widely known beginner s piano song though it shares the same name,start with two players you need a minimum of two people to play chopsticks but there is opportunity later to add more opponents face your opponent as you both put your hands in front of you each time you start a round of the game you both hold your hands out with one finger extended make sure that both you and your partner keep both hands flat and straight out so that both of you can see how many fingers each person has extended throughout the rest of the game pick one person to go first you will then take turns going back and forth on each turn one player will use one hand to tap one of their opponent s hand let s assume you are going first tap one of your opponent s hand with one of yours if you tap with one finger then your opponent will add your one finger their extended fingers and extend the sum of the two for example you tap your opponent s hand you have one finger and they have two they then add the fingers and on their tapped hand they put out three fingers on the next turn your opponent uses their hand of three fingers to tap your hand of one you now have to hold out four fingers because your one finger plus their three equals four fingers only the tapping hand has the power to change your opponent s hand 1 x research source take turns between players to tap each others hands the goal is to keep going and adding fingers to your opponent s hand by tapping when someone s hand reaches five fingers that are extended that hand is considered dead and is no longer in play 2 x research source there are several variations of this rule but the simple rules of chopsticks dictate that once a hand has reached five fingers that hand is useless which makes sense because one of background stories behind chopsticks is that you can hold a chopstick with up to one finger but an open hand means that you are going to drop your utensil and food as well 3 x research source hide dead hands behind your back continue playing until one player has lost both of their hands the goal is to be the last one standing with at least one hand left still alive master the basics and then add new rules like many math and strategy games such as chess there are a limited amount of plays that are possible before the game becomes predictable to prevent the same player winning every round and the other player losing add the other rules to make the game play fair make the game more interesting by adding new rules once you master the basic rules and can add speed create new challenges there are several name variations for the rules but they remain the same even though this game is played internationally introduce splits into the game when it s your turn you can tap your own two hands together to redistribute the number of fingers you have extended for example if you have one hand with three fingers and one hand with just one finger and you split them you can put two fingers on each hand the goal of this strategy is to prevent one of your hands from reaching five fingers and becoming dead splits don t have to be even but it s preferable some odd number combinations merely means swapping fingers between hands with no strategic bonus however if you have a combination such as four fingers and one finger on each hand you can split that into a hand of three and a hand of two a player can revive a dead hand by splitting if you have one hand dead and one alive with four fingers you can split and put two fingers on each hand to bring your dead hand back into the game a variation on the splits rule is the house rule this rule either means that splits are not allowed or that splits are allowed but can t bring a hand back from the dead 4 x research source add the game of five a hand must be tapped to equal exactly five fingers for example if your opponent has 3 fingers you can only tap them with a hand with 1 or 2 fingers you would not be able to tap their hand if yours has 3 or 4 fingers because that would create a sum of more than 5 fingers on the tapped hand 5 x research source this rule is also known as exact play this rule allows for the possibility of stalemate if both players have two hands of four points play with more than one person you can have three players or you could have a whole circle of players everyone should stand in a circle and face toward the middle so that everyone s hands are visible take turns going clockwise or counterclockwise and keep in mind that you aren t limited to only tapping the people directly next to you 6 x research source adding people will make the game stretch on much longer this method requires much more focus to win with so many people playing there may be a person with a hand about to reach five fingers who splits their fingers and it goes unnoticed by the group make sure that everyone is following the same set of rules before starting there is no wrong way to play but make sure everyone is in agreement with rules before starting a round increase the mathematical difficulty by adding nubs rather than having fully extended fingers for the whole game you can used curled fingers or nubs nubs are created by splitting an odd number of fingers on one of your turns 7 x research source two nubs equal one finger so it takes longer to make a combination or nubs and full fingers equal enough for a dead hand decide if nubs are allowed at the beginning of the game a desperate player will often add the nubs variant when they are about to lose an example for splitting fingers into nubs can look like this there are two fingers on your left hand and three on your right if you split them you can put 2 5 fingers or two fingers and a nub on either hand nubs are most beneficial for when you have a total uneven amount of fingers you must complete someone s nub in order to make it a full finger to make a dead hand you must have five full fingers not four full fingers and one nub use leftovers to make the game last longer a hand does not die but instead stays in the game or comes back to life when a tapped hand exceeds five fingers in a turn when using leftovers you can add three and four fingers together to get 7 fingers which equals a dead hand plus two more sometimes this variation is called zombies this rule could make the game could go on forever since you recycle fingers the only option for a dead hand is that it equals exactly five fingers when tapped 8 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to calculate a light year,at first glance you may think that a light year is a measure of time given that it has the word year in it light years are actually a measure of distance that uses light as a standard if you have ever told a friend you are about five minutes away you have also used time as a measure of distance 1 x research source the distances between stars across the universe are very great so astronomers use light years as a larger unit than miles or kilometers to calculate the actual distance of a light year you simply need to multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds in a year,define the light year a light year is a measure of distance equal to how far light travels in one earth year because distances across the universe are so large astronomers use light years without light years discussing the distance between two stars would require the use of large unruly numbers 2 x research source another measure of distance you may come across when learning astronomy is the parsec it is equal to 3 26 light years it is another way to simplify the numbers used to calculate and discuss astronomical distances 3 x research source write the formula for distance using the common physics formula distance equals rate times time or d r x t you can calculate how long a light year is light year speed of light x one year since speed of light is represented by the variable c you can rewrite the equation as d c x t where d is the distance of a light year c is the speed of light and t is time 4 x research source if you want to know the distance of a light year in kilometers you will need to find the speed of light in kilometers per second if you want miles you will need the speed of light in miles per second you need to know the number of seconds in one earth year for this calculation define the speed of light light in a vacuum travels at a velocity of 186 000 miles per second this is the equivalent of 299 792 kilometers per second or 670 616 629 miles per hour 5 x research source here we will use the velocity in miles per second for this calculation we will use the speed of light c equals 186 000 miles per second this can be rewritten in scientific notation as 1 86 x 105 miles per second calculate the number of seconds in a year to find the number of seconds in a year you will do a series of multiplications by conversions units to convert years to seconds you will multiply the number of days in a year times the number of hours in a day times the number of minutes in an hour times the number of seconds in a minute 1 year x 365 days year x 24 hours day x 60 minutes hour x 60 seconds minute 31 536 000 seconds 6 x research source again we can rewrite this large number using scientific notation as 3 154 x 107 plug variables into equation and solve now that you have defined the variables for speed of light and time you can plug them into the equation d c x t and solve for the distance of a light year replace c with 1 86 x 105 miles per second and time with 3 15 x 107 seconds 7 x research source d c x t d 1 86 x 105 x 3 154 x 107 seconds d 5 8 x 1012 or 5 8 trillion miles calculate the distance in kilometers if you wanted to calculate in kilometers simply replace the speed of light with the speed in kilometers per second 3 00 x 105 the time in seconds remains the same because there is no conversion required 8 x research source d c x t d 3 00 x 105 x 3 154 x 107 seconds d 9 46 x 1012 or 9 5 trillion kilometers identify the distance you want to convert before you begin you will want to make sure that whatever distance you are working with is either in miles if using imperial units or in kilometers if working with metric it doesn t make much sense to convert smaller distances into light years but you can if you re curious to convert feet into miles remember that there are 5 280 feet in a mile x ft 1 mile 5280 ft miles 9 x research source to convert meters into kilometers simply divide by 1000 x m 1 km 1000 m km determine the correct conversion factor you need to identify the units for the distance that you re converting to light years if you re converting from kilometers to light years you will use a different conversion factor than if you re converting from miles to convert from kilometers to light years you will use 1 light year 9 46 x 1012 km 10 x research source to convert from miles to light years you will use 1 light year 5 88 x 1012 miles 11 x research source multiply the original distance by the conversion factor once you have determined the proper conversion factor you can multiply by the original distance to obtain the distance in light years when numbers are large it is best to use scientific notation for example if you knew that an object was approximately 14 2 x 1014 miles away from earth how many light years would that be use the miles conversion factor 1 5 88 x 1012 multiply 14 2 x 1014 x 1 5 88 x 1012 2 41 x 102 241 light years the object is 241 light years away find help you can always ask for assistance from your teacher and fellow students there are also many resources online and in your text book to help you when converting to light years don t hesitate to ask for extra help if you need it remember there are always multiple ways to get help when looking for an answer,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to get a prototype made,getting a prototype made for your product is a necessary step between design and production before you can start production and convince people to buy your product you will need to refine your design and present a working model basic prototypes can be made with household materials but there are also plenty of machine shops 3d printing firms and other places that can build you a prototype in a short amount of time to get your prototype made present a thought out design and find a company that s right for you,take apart competing products unless you ve come up with something original your product is going to have competitors in the market get those products and disassemble them if you re building a jetpack unscrew a competing jetpack look at the materials used and how you can save time and improve upon your design similarly for electronic products such as websites or applications dig into the coding find out the ways you can improve the product to make yours more successful don t copy someone else s design or else you ll get sued incorporate what you learn to refine your own design make a sketch of your product write or type out your product s ideas on a piece of paper draw what your product will look like if you can this will give you a rough idea of how the first prototype will look and allow you catch flaws and ways to improve the design before you invest in building a prototype use the sketch to decide upon what features are necessary to your design choose the few features that allow your design to function and limit the amount of costly extras such as painting and adding voice commands to your robot vacuum design obtain a computer aided design cad of your prototype cad requires specialized training so a professional can help you with this the computer design is much more detailed than your initial sketch this is the design you will give to the prototype maker in order to get the most clear and detailed idea of your product if your product isn t something you ll be able to make at home on your own you ll need this be sure to check the credentials of your designer as well as their cost per hour ask for examples of their work and possibly credentials from a certified cad school program create a handmade version of your design the first example of your prototype may be made at home and can be made in miniature to save money physical products can be made with whatever you have laying around your house such as making your leather handbag design out of some nylon clothing you re not using having a sample design of your product makes it easier to explain to prototype designers and investors and will give you another chance to refine your design 1 x research source at this point the design doesn t need to be perfect this handmade design only needs to be presentable showing that your idea is possible using alternate material from your original design forces you to test your idea and consider why you made it the way you did you may even find that the nylon works better than the leather for your handbag for physical products choose a cheap modeling product such as shapelock which when treated with heat can be molded like clay for electronic products search for third party programming libraries in order to save time on coding and image design fill in these parts later use a modeling program while making a physical design by hand is an option thanks to technology you can use computer software to make a digital prototype various types of software take your idea either drawn out on paper or inside the software itself and turn it into a 3d interactive design at less time and cost than making it yourself or hiring help 2 x research source programs such as prototyping on paper and invision let you upload designs and make interactive models to mimic how customers will handle your product try programs such as dribbble and freebiesbug to buy user interfaces for mobile applications in order to save time or money spent on a designer use a program such as skala preview to monitor changes you make to your design as you work find prototype makers that fit your budget prototype making involves molding assembly and labor costs traditionally making a prototype gets somewhat expensive settle upon the material you want to use for your prototype which should be the same as what you want to use in the final product speak to representatives at companies and check their costs and credentials professional designers can be located on free sites such as thomasnet com you may also be able to someone who can make your prototype cheaper such as a student from a local university protect your design as you consult with prototype companies ask about their credentials and past work to ensure that the prototype will be quality and true to your design even if the company you choose has worked well with its customers in the past get a non disclosure agreement from the company or designer before you hire them unless you already have a patent the more professional the prototype looks the easier it will be to sell to prospective buyers the non disclosure agreement serves as legal protection in case someone steals your design consider 3d printing 3d printing is a rapidly expanding field these printers use cad designs from scanned or computer made 3d models to layer material into a working prototype many firms exist now that offer a simple cheaper alternative in prototype making be sure to check a company s costs and credentials before you hire them 3 x research source these printers are also increasingly found in homes so you may be able to print the prototype yourself remember to get a non disclosure agreement if you don t have a patent so no one can steal your design obtain funding a good prototype gives your product more appeal to investors first you can approach friends and family for extra funding but you may need to approach outside sources to make your product s production a reality there are several ways to do this such as pitching your product to companies finding investors through networking or trying crowdfunding crowdfunding can be done online through sites such as kickstarter where you showcase your design for pre purchases you can trade equity in your product to sites such as 500 startups and y combinator for an investment 4 x research source contact brand names that would be interested in your product or seek out individual investors and convince them of the success of your idea 5 x research source fill your orders make as many of your product as you can sell the initial construction cost of a prototype is expensive for anyone who doesn t have a lot of extra money on hand so you don t want to get stuck with a large inventory as you try to sell your product you ll also need to go back and improve upon the design 6 x research source consider packaging and shipping costs in addition to manufacturing and storage,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to play snaps,have you seen the movie ps i love you with hilary swank and liked the game snaps that her character plays or maybe you played the game of snaps at camp and forgot how to play it learning to play snaps is very simple and will provide hours of laughs for you and your friends or family,know the basic rules of snaps the game of snaps is a fairly simply concept that requires nothing other than at least two people the ability to snap your fingers and some creative thinking the basic idea of snaps is to spell out individual letters of a word using either a statement or a snap of your fingers there are at least two players in snaps the snapper is the person who chooses a word and then snaps out the answer the receiver is the person who listens to the snapper and guesses the word for consonants you ll say a sentence or statement in which the first word starts with the same letter that you are trying to spell out for example if you choose george washington your first letter is a g you ll clue the receiver into the name by starting with a sentence like get ready this lets the receiver know that the first name of the person or the clue is g 1 x research source for vowels you snap your fingers hence the name of the game each vowel corresponds to a specific number of snaps a is one snap e is two snaps i is three snaps o is four snaps and u is five snaps thus for the second letter of george washington you would give two clear snaps for an e 2 x research source there is no cue for a space in between words choose the name of a person that you want the receiver to guess since the idea of snaps is to guess the name of someone choose one that everyone can easily guess such as a politician or celebrity 3 x research source for example you can use hillary clinton or britney spears try to avoid difficult names or names that start with difficult letters for example the name xavier would be difficult to use because of the x there are no words with which you could put together a cue sentence decide if you want to give the receiver the exact name or the clue to the name you don t necessarily have to give your receiver the person s exact name to make it a bit more difficult you can snap your receiver a clue to the person s name 4 x research source for example if you want the receiver to guess george washington you could snap out the clue first president for marlon brando you could use the godfather figure out good consonant statements and a clear clue to the name if necessary once you know the name that you want to play figure out how to spell it properly first and then look at the consonants if you ve decided to use a clue instead of the direct name you ll need to devise a clear clue for the receiver for example for the name george washington you ll need to have brief statements to clue your reader into each consonant in the name or in the clue you could use read the newspaper for r if you decide to use first president as your clue you could use party on as your statement for the letter p clue your receiver about the word to be snapped before you start spelling out your letter with statements and snaps clue your receiver about the nature of the word with a simple sentence 5 x research source if you re using the direct name of a person say snaps is the name of the game this lets your receiver know that you re spelling out the name of a person 6 x research source if you re giving the receiver a clue about the person such as rocky for sylvester stallone or the godfather for marlon brando say snaps isn t the name of the game this clues your receiver that you re spelling out a clue to the name 7 x research source give the first letter to the receiver after you ve clued in your receiver that you re giving her a name or a clue give her the first letter of the word with either a statement or snaps most names will begin with a consonant so you will likely begin with a statement thus for sylvester stallone you could start with the statement super duper to let your receiver know the first letter is a s give the second letter when the receiver has figured out the first letter move on to the second letter of your name or clue only do this once they re ready to go and you ve either figured out a next statement or vowel depending on the second letter second letters are often vowels so your next clue will probably be a series of snaps for al pacino you will want to snap clearly once to indicate to your receiver that a is the next letter remember to snap clearly so that your receiver can hear each individual snap follow the same pattern for the rest of the letters use the same pattern of snaps and statements until you ve finished spelling out either the name or the clue if there are any parts that the receiver didn t get go back and give the statements or snap series again guess the person s name or clue have your receiver guess the person once you ve finished spelling out the name or clue if he doesn t get it you can either help him or play another round of snaps to solve the name if you decided to use a clue to a person s name have your receiver guess the clue first and then the name pay attention to the snapper s first line make sure to pay close attention to what the snapper says before he begins using snaps or statements this will help you know if he is using a name or a clue about a name if the snapper is using the direct name of a person he will say snaps is the name of the game 8 x research source if the snapper says snaps isn t the name of the game then you know that he is spelling out a clue about a person 9 x research source listen closely to the first statement or series of snaps the snapper will either give you a clue or snap for the first letter of the name or clue make sure to pay close attention to this so you get the game off to a good start for example if the snapper chose benjamin netanyahu as the name he would first say a statement like be prepared to let you know that the first letter of the name or clue is b if he chose the name iggy pop on the other hand he would first snap three times to let you know that the first letter is i follow this pattern until the snapper finishes the name or the clue listen to the snapper s statements and snaps until he says that he is finished so that you can successfully solve the name or clue if it makes it easier to remember each letter write them down on a piece of paper guess the name or the clue to the name once the snapper has finished spelling out the name or the clue guess what it is if you can t get it either ask the snapper to clarify something or play another round of snaps to solve the name if the snapper decided to use a clue to a person s name guess the clue first and then the name,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build a sawbuck for cutting firewood,one of the most useful tools for cutting firewood is a good x shaped sawbuck a sawbuck is a special kind of sawhorse framed for holding rough wood so you can saw it into lengths suitable for use in a stove or fireplace the sawbuck basically consists of two x forms one at each end which may be stabilized by a third central x the long firewood to be cut is placed in the top v part of the x pieces where it may then be sawed,select the size design the permanent sawbuck to be 6 vertical 2x4 s 38 mm x 89 mm or 2x6s 38 mm x 140mm of about 4 feet 1 22 meters long and 4 horizontal 2x6 s 5 feet 1 52 meters long using 3 5 inch 8 89 cm wood screws or nails 1 x research source see tips for information on making a demo prototype version instead cutting the top v form portion at an angle and with a shorter top would make it lighter and more open adding a trough or floor as a retainer like feature into the top v allows for a lower chance of shorter pieces of firewood unexpectedly falling from the inner part of the sawbuck to the ground place the middle of the x a little higher for use with a chainsaw rather than lower for a bow saw if you prefer design your sawbuck sawhorse by considering various methods shown in the illustrations tailor the design as you desire or require use suitable boards for your project nominal 2x6s or 2x4s of pine southern yellow or lodgepole or white or spruce will be fine decide if it is the taller or shorter height that you think you may want namely and cut the x pieces about 48 inches 1 22 meters long 2 x research source adjust the height according to what feels right to you 3 x research source consider starting with one the first x temporarily attached together with two nails screws to see how tall and wide that you want to make it take it apart and angle cut and trim the angle of the v as shown in the photo above 4 x research source angled cutting of the v and making the upper arms shorter than the legs will make it less top heavy the arms help to hold poles and limbs to be cut on the sawbuck use this as your pattern for the rest feature the upper v part being deep allows you to nestle and cut two or more narrow poles or tree limbs around 3 to 8 feet 91 44 cm x 44 meters in length for cutting with a chainsaw to chop your firewood at a faster rate design a lower sawbuck if you would like to use the x sawbuck with a hand bow saw make the sawbuck about only 20 24 50 8 cm x 60 9 cm high to the center this will allow the user to put a foot on top of the poles or resulting in the split wood being cut when it is that low as illustrated design a wide heavily braced base to give you more stability while handling a chainsaw caution a lightweight sawbuck might lead to an injury if it falls over while you are cutting don t use a smaller sawbuck for chainsaw work to build a non folding sawbuck simply connect the x forms together using 4 to 6 nails screws driven permanently into the near center of each x make the sawbuck fold if you like one way to connect the sawbuck together is to use one big bolt of about a 4 inch 10 16 cm long and 1 2 inch 12 7 mm in diameter 5 x research source you may find inexpensive or free long bolts and nuts that fit them on the ground in a self service automobile wrecking yard put it in the exact same placement at the center of each x using extra large washers so that it can be clamped together and loosened to fold for storage consider screwing on a leg spacer brace on each x then unscrew the end spacer brace to allow the x to fold long common bolts are not very expensive they cost between 1 to 1 50 each at a lumber or hardware store but tempered hardened fine threaded bolts cost about 4 to 5 times as much a simple rough sawbuck or sawhorse may be built in the woods for a camp or lodge the rustic form shown here can be made in the field from available materials following a similar process but with wooden poles instead state parks and such probably do not allow any harvesting of wood so this building a sawbuck is for private land or the untamed wilderness,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to play 21 questions,have you ever wanted to ask someone a question but weren t sure they would answer the game 21 questions is a great game to play if you are trying to get to know someone have a group of friends who want to know more about each other or have a romantic partner you want to learn more about unlike the common 20 questions game these questions are designed to be personal and must after the person in question has agreed to play be answered fully and honestly,choose someone to answer questions the purpose of the game is to ask someone solo or a member of a group 21 questions all of which must be answered honestly although it can be played with friends you ve had for a while it is usually best to choose someone you don t know as well or someone you want to get to know on a deeper level if you do not have a new acquaintance or romantic interest tailor your questions to suit getting to know someone more deeply identify what you want to know once you ve chosen a person to ask questions of identify what it is you want to know about them if you ve chosen a friend do you want to know more about their background or are you more interested in their future plans if you ve chosen a romantic partner do you want to know about their dating history or do you want to know how they feel about your relationship 1 x research source if you are playing in a group you can decide as a group what types of questions to ask this can be tailored to each target or there can be an overall theme for the game write a list of questions there are two ways to play the first involves people asking whatever questions come to mind and asking them at random the second has the pair or group come up with a set list of questions which are then posed to each person 2 x research source writing a list beforehand is the easier choice as everyone knows what they will be asked and will likely agree to answer asking at random may be the more entertaining choice but is also at higher risk of getting too personal or inappropriate consider the setting if you decide to play this game with strangers or acquaintances you meet in a specific setting you may want to take that setting into consideration when forming some or all of your questions if meeting with members of a book club or writer s group you might ask questions like what is your favorite book or if you could be any fictional character from any book who would you be if meeting with a church group consider questions such as what is your favorite bible verse story or when did you first develop an interest in religion if meeting someone new at the grand opening of a coffee shop consider questions like what is your favorite snack to enjoy with coffee or would you rather give up coffee for a month or stop showering for a week show respect although many of the people playing 21 questions use is as a method to ask probing or otherwise inappropriate questions respect the privacy of the person being asked questions particularly in a group of people if they want to sidestep something or answer in vague terms allow them to do so the golden rule is a great thing to keep in mind when playing this game treat the target the same way you d like to be treated during your turn as a target identify off limits questions there are some questions that should not be asked in any circumstance before you begin the game identify any questions that might be too inconsiderate thoughtless or crude to ask 3 x research source these questions can include broad categories such as sex and intimacy or can be specific questions such as have you ever committed a crime you can also create guidelines about the sort of questions being asked based by theme for instance if playing 21 questions at a church youth group you might indicate that at least half of the questions must be religious in nature set rules for how to pass on a question there may be a question that is just too probing or intimate for someone to answer to safeguard against people getting upset make a rule before starting the game for these instances 4 x research source a simple rule could be that a target can pass on a question but must then be asked a question in its place or that the target can pass on a question but will forfeit their turn to ask the next target a question determine the target sequence in a group there are going to be multiple targets and multiple people asking questions so you need to choose a fair method for deciding who goes first second third and so on rolling a die is a great way to choose a sequence each person rolls and the person with the lowest roll goes first followed by the second lowest and so forth you can also do something like rock paper scissors to determine who will go first and do it again before each new game you can also go in a circle when deciding the order of targets once the first person has gone the person to their left is the next target and that cycle continues until everyone has had a turn take turns asking questions now that the target and sequence have been decided upon each member of the group should take a turn asking the target questions you can divvy up the questions based on the number of people in the group a group of 3 askers could have 7 questions each for instance or you can go in a circle and have each person ask one question at a time if there is a number of people unable to divide evenly into 21 sit in a circle and have someone start the questions the next round the person to their left can start the questions and continue in this manner until everyone has had a chance to ask first move on to the next target once all 21 questions have been asked either move on to the next target in the predetermined sequence or take a minute to determine a new target using rock paper scissors or a coin flip agree upon boundaries before and after the game when you are playing with only two people you may be asking more personal or intimate questions than you would in a group for this reason you should both agree upon boundaries for before the game questions that are off limits as well as after the game such as we cannot treat each other differently after answering the questions this game can injure friendships and relationships quickly if proper precautions are not taken do not ask questions you do not genuinely want the answer to if you are not sure whether a question is appropriate simply ask and give your playing partner a chance to either accept the question or request another one choose who will go first the simplest way to choose the first target when only two people are present is to flip a coin once you ve flipped your coin understand that you must take a turn after the first target has completed their questions do not use this game as a means to gather information and refuse to play after the target has finished this game should always be played on equal footing ask questions ask the target 21 questions using the previously agreed upon list of off limits questions as a guide if you are playing with a friend ask questions that tell you more about your friend your friendship and your friend s preferences if you are playing with a romantic partner ask questions about their life background your relationship and their needs 5 x research source this game can be great for new couples who want to know more about each other quickly and easily this game is also wonderful for breaking the ice with a new acquaintance and should focus on basic getting to know you questions or silly questions rather than deep or intimate ones take your turn once you have finished asking questions take your turn submit yourself to the same questions you ve asked or answer entirely new questions give the new asker the same courtesy they gave you and answer questions honestly and succinctly if you do not feel comfortable answering a question be gracious in asking for a new question the game is supposed to be fun and should not cause anger or emotional injury cover the basics to start out ask basic questions such as someone s favorite color their first celebrity crush or where they grew up you ll want to ask small easy questions at first to build trust between the asker s and target 6 x research source ask favorites questions such as what was your favorite age what is your favorite place to visit what was your favorite part of school what is your favorite way to travel ask what if questions you can ask what if you could visit any time period in the past what if you could fly what if you had fingers on your feet and toes on your hands build upon the questions you ve already asked once you ve built some groundwork with basic questions you can ask more personal questions or you can simply build off of the questions you ve already asked and the answers you ve received to build off of answers you ve received take an answer and phrase a question around it such as your greatest fear is spiders so what would you do if you moved into a house with a spider infestation to build to more personal questions you can say something like the person you d most like to meet with in the past or present is susan b anthony why is she so important to you ask questions that require creative answers some questions are going to be simple e g what is your favorite movie and why while others are going to require a little bit of thought even if you are asking serious questions ask the target questions that require some creativity or ingenuity to answer 7 x research source ask silly questions such as do hair stylists go to other stylists or do they cut their own hair or if an ambulance accidentally injures someone on its way to save someone else who do the paramedics choose to save you can ask serious questions too such as if the world was ending and you had to save one person who would you save or if your relationship was starting to go sour what would you do to try to save it ask about family and backgrounds whether you playing with a friend or a romantic partner you could always stand to learn about other people s family and backgrounds asking about family can help you get to know your playing partner s habits and traditions and asking about their background can lend insight into any cultural differences or interesting ideas they may have 8 x research source for family ask questions such as who raised you was your family close growing up did you have any special traditions during holidays for background you can ask questions such as do you know where your ancestors are originally from did you celebrate any special holidays growing up when dealing with family and backgrounds remember to exercise sensitivity both are very personal topics and require kindness and open mindedness ask about past romances and interests questions about past romances have the potential to be silly entertaining or informative when deciding what type of past romance questions to ask consider the tone of the game are you playing to deepen your connection to your playing partner or are you playing to escape boredom on a weekend 9 x research source if you want to develop a deeper connection with your playing partner you can ask questions such as who was your first kiss what is the best date you ve ever been on and why was it the best do you have any fantasies if you are asking silly questions you can ask thing such as what was your most awkward kiss have you ever sneezed in a love interest s face how long should you wait before passing gas in front of your significant other ask about goals and aspirations when asking about goals and aspirations you must also be somewhat delicate as you don t want to laugh or make light of other people s dreams when asking these types of questions you can keep things light hearted but avoid mocking your playing partner s answers 10 x research source light hearted questions can include what did you want to be when you were 5 where do you see yourself in 10 years do you hope to be famous one day more serious goal questions can include questions such as what do you want more than anything else in the world if you could do anything and money

how to countersink,countersinking a screw helps the screw head lie flush with the surface of the wood to better conceal the hardware if you want to make your next woodworking project look clean and professional you can easily countersink the screws with just a few tools start by drilling a pilot hole for your screw so you can thread it in easily without splitting the wood after that you can use a countersink cutter to drill a larger hole for the screw head once the screw is in place you can either leave it exposed or conceal it using wood putty,measure the diameter of the screw s shaft with calipers make sure the screw you re using has a flat head with a cone shaped bottom or else it won t countersink easily open the jaws of the calipers wide enough so you can put the screw between them tighten the jaws around the main shaft of the screw but not on the threading which is the raised area that rotates around the screw read the measurement on the side of the calipers to know the diameter of the screw s shaft 1 x research source you can buy calipers from your local hardware store don t include the threading in your diameter measurement otherwise the hole you drill will be too big and the screw will slip out install a drill bit that s the same diameter as the screw s shaft onto your drill look through a set of drill bits and use your calipers to measure their diameters search for a bit that either has the same size or is about 1 16 inch 1 6 mm smaller than the screw to make your pilot hole install the bit you re using in the drill s chuck which is the rotating part that locks it in place 2 x research source you can buy a set of multiple drill bits from your local hardware store there are many tables and guides online that specify how big pilot holes need to be depending on what size screw you have clamp the wood down to secure it set the wood on a flat well lit work surface so you can easily see what you re doing open the jaws of your c clamp and secure them around the piece of wood you re drilling into tighten the jaws on the clamp to secure the piece of wood so it doesn t rotate or shift while you re trying to drill into it 3 x research source try pushing the piece of wood to see if it moves or shifts if it does put another c clamp on the opposite side mark the location you re drilling with the end of your screw put a dot on the piece of wood with a pen or pencil where you want to make your hole then take the pointed end of your screw and push it lightly into the surface to make a small dent the dent will give the drill a good starting point so it doesn t slip or shift while you re making your hole 4 x research source if you aren t able to make a dent in the wood with the screw by itself lightly tap on the screw s head with a hammer drill the pilot hole so it s the same depth as the screw length hold the drill so the bit is perpendicular to the wood press down on the drill s trigger to start making your hole apply light pressure to push the bit deeper into the wood until it reaches the same depth as your screw let go of the trigger and pull the bit straight out so you don t damage it 5 x research source wear safety glasses while you drill your hole so you don t get sawdust in your eyes don t force the drill bit into the wood since you could cause it to break and you could seriously hurt yourself if you want an easy reminder of how deep you need to drill wrap a piece of masking tape around the drill bit so it s at the same length as the screw that way you won t be able to push the drill any farther than you need to secure a fluted countersink cutter in your drill that s the same size as your screw a fluted countersink cutter has a wider base that comes to a point and contains multiple cutting edges so you can make larger holes for the screw s head use a cutter that matches the numbered size of your screw which is usually 6 8 or 10 pick a countersink cutter that has an 82 degree taper since it s the most common angle on the bottom of the screw s head secure the countersink cutter to the end of your drill so it fits tightly 6 x research source you can buy a countersink cutter from your local hardware store you can also get countersink cutters with a flat bottom if the screws you re using don t have an angled head drill slowly into the pilot hole with the cutter to make countersink place the point of the countersink cutter in the middle of the pilot hole so it s perpendicular to the wood pull the trigger slowly and apply light pressure as you push the cutter further into the pilot hole stop drilling every 5 6 seconds to clear away sawdust and check the size of the countersink 7 x research source put on safety glasses while you re drilling to protect your eyes in case the cutter breaks or comes loose don t force the countersink cutter into the wood since you could make the hole too deep or damage the bit hold the screw s head against the hole to check if it s the same size take the countersink cutter out from the hole and clear away any sawdust that built up around it turn your screw upside down and press the head against the countersink hole if the hole is the same diameter as the screw s head then you re ready to screw it in if the hole is smaller than the screw head continue using the countersink cutter to make the hole larger 8 x research source use your drill to secure the screw in the hole until the top is flush remove the countersink cutter from the end of your drill and replace it with a screwdriver bit position the point of the screw so it lines up with your pilot hole and put the screwdriver bit into the slots on top pull the trigger to slowly drive the screw into the hole until it s level with the wood surface 9 x research source you can drive the screw further into the wood if you want to conceal it later on spread wood putty over the screw and hole if you want to hide them wood putty has a clay like consistency but it hardens to mimic the texture and grain of the wood scoop wood putty out of the container with a putty knife and press it into the countersink hole over the screw pull the putty knife in multiple directions over the hole to make sure it fills in evenly scrape off any excess putty with the knife and return it to the container 10 x research source you can buy wood putty from your local hardware store you will not be able to remove the screw if you cover it with putty only use putty if you want the screw to be permanent let the wood putty dry for up to 8 hours leave the putty in a cool dry place so it has time to set the time it takes for your putty to dry depends on how much you use and how deep the hole is but it usually takes around 6 8 hours for it to fully harden try touching it with your finger to see if any lifts up or still feels tacky to the touch 11 x research source some wood putties come with a hardening agent to help promote faster drying mix the hardening agent with the putty before you apply it for it to take effect sand the putty with 120 grit sandpaper until it s flush with the rest of the wood rub the surface of the wood in circular or back and forth strokes to smooth out any raised or bumpy areas change which direction you sand the wood often so the surface looks even wipe away any sawdust and run your hand over the wood to check if it feels level 12 x research source you can use an electric sander to speed up the process if you want but it s not required if you do wear a dust mask so you don t breathe any sawdust paint or stain the wood to help conceal the putty the putty may have a slightly different color than the rest of the wood once it dries if you want to make the wood look like it s a single solid piece coat the surface with a thin layer of paint or stain to change the color of the wood as the wood and putty absorb the color you won t be able to see the area where you put the screw anymore 13 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to start a low power fm radio station,you have the means to start a low powered radio station without a fcc license low powered fm radio stations are a good resource for nonprofits schools churches community groups and unions note that the fcc rarely hands out permits for commercial free radio 1 x trustworthy source federal communications commission independent u s government agency responsible for regulating radio television and satellite and phone communications go to source luckily there are alternative ways to get your voice heard through the fm airwaves,understand unlicensed broadcasting unlicensed broadcasting is legal using a low powered transmitter which was discussed in part 15 of the fcc s rules these devices are limited to 200 feet 61 meter range the transmitters are manufactured under the regulation of the fcc and have visible indicators for you to tell 2 x research source one of the disadvantages of this system is that you have to accept any disturbance from a higher powered radio station find an available frequency on the radio before you take into account the necessary expenses of a low power fm radio station you should seek out availability the fcc allows commercial radio stations to bleed into or overpower your radio station search through your local fm stations and find a station without any radio programming the key is to find the purest static channel make sure there aren t other voices or sounds lingering in the background if there are a couple clean stations in a row then you re in good shape if you live in a metropolitan city like chicago or l a you will have trouble finding a station like this you can do a quick check by visiting radiospark org rfree for a search of available stations in your area find out what type of station your community needs you are a member of a community and feel the need to power a radio station that your community is lacking consider if other members of your community want the same type of programming on the airways a good way to receive feedback is by creating flyers with information about your radio station hang the flyers around town and in community active spots like a coffee shop library or a venue space if the station becomes popular it is legal to profit from advertisements say on the flyer what do you want to hear on the radio in big bold letters and then explain what your station does make a list of necessary equipment it ll help you keep track of what you need by making a quick list of all the equipment you ll need to power the station this includes a transmitter antenna and basic sound equipment microphones mixer cd player etc take a quick inventory of media devices you own like a turntable cd player cassette player etc do a basic search online to determine a rough price of the gear you ll need create the mission and vision for your station mission statements are meant to be a brief write up of your organization this is an area where you can share the philosophy model you are basing your radio station around other items to include are your goals and your performance standards these are goals to strive for with a mission statement to make it memorable credible inspirational and simple 3 x research source take a look at some mission statements for nonprofit organizations online here s an example from the station ashevillefm at ashevillefm we re reflecting and adding to the rich stew of arts culture and community involvement that is asheville we re bringing music news and the unusual to the airwaves at 103 3fm here in asheville while having a global reach through our online stream with over 1 7 million hits a month 4 x research source fundraise depending on how far you plan to take your station fundraising in the beginning can benefit your long term goals look into some organizations that could be interested in your radio station once you find a local organization draft a letter explaining your fundraising goals and include your mission statement 5 x research source there are many websites that allow you to make a fundraising pitch online gather your source equipment your source equipment includes a cd player cassette player record player or other form of media players you aren t required to have this equipment available but it will benefit you if you are a music based station consider getting used audio equipment from craigslist or other music posting websites use a reliable computer there are many benefits to having a computer for your radio station and studio you can generate the bulk of your station s broadcast with only a computer playing music miscellaneous sounds and even your own voice many radio stations record shows on computers and play them at a selected time over the airways if you are first starting out a computer will cut down on a lot of your audio costs you can upload your radio show as a podcast or as an internet radio station with a computer get a microphone and audio console unless you plan to play music alone you should invest in at least one microphone if not two you will also need an audio mixer to switch between multiple audio outputs like a turntable microphone and computer for a good quality microphones invest in a sennheiser md 421 or a shure sh 55 6 x research source there are options if you don t want to deal with audio equipment you can invest in a usb microphone that goes directly into your computer these mics have been continuing to grow and offer a range in quality consider getting help from a tech savvy friend if you re beginning to feel overwhelmed obtain other audio equipment asides from the microphones and mixing boards you ll need cables to attach everything together most transmitters take an ⅛ jack headphone jack so you ll need to use the right converters for your mixer other cables that might help you are xlr cables for microphones and rca cables for external audio players if you went with the usb microphone you don t need to worry about this step you ll also need one or two sets of headphones depending on how many people plan to talk for future endeavors you should have two headphones or more if you use multiple headphones you will also need a headphone splitter acquire a part 15 transmitter search through the internet for a professional grade low powered fm transmitter there are several options available that are all verified by the fcc you can spend a small amount of money 80 or spend a larger sum of around 300 7 x research source for a cleaner signal shop for a mono transmitter opposed to a stereo transmitter some transmitters come with an antenna but these models aren t as powerful or reliable use a good antenna remember a good antenna is a must for clear and long transmission an antenna that works well on one frequency may not work as well on another some audio stores will have antennas for fm transmitters but you will probably have more luck shopping online you can also purchase a custom antenna tuned to your radio frequency check out radio brandy for custom antennas http www radiobrandy com fmantenna html prepare a few programs if your station is dedicated to music prepare music specials if your station is about science create some interesting programs related to science consider if you want the length of your programs to be 30 minutes or an hour you could also plan to do a quick 10 minutes of talking every hour of a music show plan for a week of broadcasting and choose certain programs for individual days consistency is important for programs to develop a following the key to planning programs is that each show is exciting in some way when in doubt throw on a catchy playlist plug everything in before going live you should ensure that everything is plugged in and properly connected together follow each cable in your system and double check each end to be sure everything is in the proper place do a quick test of your broadcast and check the levels on your audio

how to make a mouse pad,mousepads are an essential accessory for any desktop computer user customizing your mousepad can be fun if you make your own you ll be able to adjust it to your size preferences and decorate it to match your desk area,select a piece of cardboard measure and cut it to the size you want your mouse pad to be a standard mouse pad is around 8 x 10 but feel free to customize the size to your personal preference 1 x research source use corrugated cardboard rather than flat cardboard because it provides a layer of cushioning if you have any cardboard boxes on hand you can simply cut the base of your pad from the side of a box if the cardboard you have isn t thick enough for the mousepad you want you can glue a few pieces of cardboard together to create your pad s base instead of cardboard you can also use a piece of foam core make your base non slip you don t want your mousepad to slide around on your desk while you are trying to use it you can use shelf and drawer non slip liner for the bottom of your mousepad just cut it to the size of the base of your mousepad you can find this type of liner in stores like target walmart lowes or home depot if you don t buy the adhesive kind of liner use glue to attach it alternatively you can use a piece of a rug liner in the same way if you want a simple household nonstick alternative you can use a piece of double sided tape on each corner of your pad add your tape when you are completely finished constructing your pad simply use it to stick the pad to your desk you can also use adhesive pads or putty meant for hanging posters cut a sheet of thin self adhesive foam padding this should be the same size as your cardboard and will give your mouse a good surface to move on you want to place your foam directly on top of your cardboard surface so that all the sides line up after you cut the foam remove the paper protecting the adhesive and apply it to the top of your cardboard if the foam you find doesn t have adhesive you ll want to glue the foam in place you should be able to find this type of foam at any hobby or craft store if you don t want to use foam you can just leave the cardboard plain as it will still function as a mousepad alternatively you can use something like a piece of cork as this layer of your mousepad if you have an old bulletin board simply cut out a piece the size of your pad choose a design the beauty in creating your own mousepad is that you can customize it to match your workspace decide if you want it to include a pattern a solid color or a photograph find your material once you know what you want your design to be decide on a material for the decorative top layer of your mousepad remember that you want your mousepad to stay smooth and flat so your mouse can move across it easily for photographs you can use simply a printed sheet of paper with your chosen image when you re using a photo you want to make sure you use a photo that is the size of your mouse pad rather than gluing a smaller photo in the center if you d rather have a pattern you can use wallpaper or wrapping paper thrift stores are a great place to find cheap remnants of wallpaper perfect for crafting fabric is also a good material for solid or patterned mousepads you can find fabric at any local hobby store or repurpose an old cotton shirt cut to size whatever material you choose you ll need to cut it to the size of your mousepad base you want it to be the exact size of the top of your base with clean cut edges attach your decorative top to your mousepad after you cut it to size you will want to attach your fabric or paper top to the base white glue or mod podge works well for paper tops just use a paintbrush to spread a thin even layer of glue onto the surface of your base and then smooth on your top layer of paper if you are using fabric use fabric glue or a spray adhesive for the best results avoid hot glue as this will leave lumps in your mouse pad cover the top with clear contact paper the clear contact paper will protect your design and allow your mouse to move smoothly first cut your contact paper to size then peel off its backing and apply it to your mousepad be sure to smooth out any air bubbles you can use the side of a ruler as a tool for smoothing if you d rather skip the decorative paper or fabric you can simply use an opaque contact paper with a preprinted design gather your materials to make a very simple pad you will need a small book or similarly shaped flat object a plastic envelope and some tape the book inside the envelope creates a nice flat surface for your mouse to glide on if you don t have an envelope you can also use a zip lock bag if you re in a real hurry you can use a thick magazine or a book alone as a mousepad make sure the book you use has a smooth cover and enough surface area simply place the book or magazine beside your computer 2 x research source choose the exterior of your mousepad if you have a plastic envelope this works best it has a smooth surface and a small amount of cushioning cut your envelope in half this will make your mousepad into a more manageable size for use on your desk you can leave the envelope whole if you want a very large mousepad or want to reuse the envelope later insert your weight you ll want something to put inside of your mousepad to give it weight and give your mouse something to slide around on the weight should be slightly smaller than your envelope half a slim book works well you could also use a scrap of wood or a few small pieces of cardboard put your weight inside your envelope you want it to sit comfortably inside the envelope with a bit of room on the end so you can enclose it tape your envelope shut use a few pieces of masking tape or clear tape to seal the edges of your envelope this insures that your weight won t fall out while you re using it add nonslip surface if you really need a mousepad right away you can skip this step however it can be nice to ensure your pad stays in place on your desk while you use it the simplest way to create a nonslip surface is to use a few pieces of double side adhesive to attach the pad to your desk you can also use tape poster putter or command hook adhesive,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to join two pieces of wood,from edge joints to complex dovetails there are dozens of techniques for joining wood if you need to join boards side by side to make a larger plane an edge joint is your best bet arrange the boards so they re visually pleasing then use woodworking glue and clamps to bond the boards if you need to make corner joints such as a miter corner or simple butt joint using glue alone isn t your strongest option instead drill pocket holes and use screws to strengthen your joint fortunately a pocket hole jig is fairly inexpensive and makes the job quick and easy,arrange your boards and mark them with chalk arrange the boards so the best looking side of each will be most visible in your final project shift the boards around until you ve aligned their grains in an attractive natural pattern when you re satisfied with their alignment make a big v shape across them with chalk or a lumber crayon 1 x research source for instance if you re making a table you ll want to use the most attractive sides of your boards or planks for the tabletop you ll also want their grains and colors to line up so they don t look mismatched or obviously joined the lines of your v don t have to be perfectly straight you just need to make the shape across all of the boards that way the v is legible only when the boards are correctly aligned lay the boards across strips of scrap wood set thin evenly sized strips of wood under both ends of your boards to raise them off of your work surface when you glue and clamp your boards excess glue will seep out from the joints raising the boards will keep your work surface clean 2 x research source add a strip of scrap wood in the middle if your planks or boards are long and you re concerned about bowing apply an even bead of glue along the edge of a board to spread an even bead of woodworking glue hold the bottle with one hand and the nozzle with the other move the nozzle across the edge quickly and steadily 3 x research source don t apply glue to both edges that you re joining too much glue will just cause more of a mess clamp the boards and ensure they re flush press the edges together and secure them with clamps add a clamp at each end and depending on your boards length additional clamps in the middle try to get your boards perfectly flush so you won t have to sand away imperfections after the glue has cured 4 x research source wipe away excess glue after 20 minutes to make cleanup easier you can wipe excess glue off the top surface with a damp cloth immediately after 20 minutes remove the clamps so you can carefully flip over the boards and clean the bottom side use a putty knife to scrape excess glue from this side 5 x research source the glue still needs several hours to cure so handle the joined boards gently in humid conditions you ll have to wait an hour or longer to remove the clamps allow the glue to cure overnight while you can safely remove the clamps after a short time the glue won t reach maximum strength for several hours let it dry overnight before you do any further work on the boards 6 x research source plan your work before you drill lay out the boards you ll be joining as you want them to appear in your final project use a pencil to mark the places where you want to drill pocket holes make sure you ll be drilling into face or edge grain as drilling into end grain makes for a weaker joint 7 x research source you can tell the end grain from the face and edge grains by checking the texture of the surface and arrangement of the growth rings the end grain is the rougher more porous side of a board in addition the exposed radii of a tree s growth rings are only visible at the end grain they look like a neatly arranged set of several curved lines 8 x research source to complete the process you ll drill pilot holes into a board align it with another board then drive screws through the first board s pilot holes and into the second board if you ve never drilled pocket holes before it s wise to practice on scrap wood so you can get a feel for the process set the depth of the jig to your wood s thickness a good quality pocket hole jig has a graduated alignment guide the alignment guide is built into the shaft where the guide holes are located and you can adjust it by pulling it in and out of the jig s body find the line on the alignment guide marked with your wood s depth to set the jig 9 x research source go for a jig with a built in alignment guide and clamp while they re cheaper products that lack these features are less precise and more difficult to use 10 x research source insert the bit into the jig s guide hole to adjust the bit collar a pocket hole drill bit has a collar that you use to control the hole s depth use an allen wrench which should be included with your bit to loosen the collar from the bit insert the bit into one of the jig s guide holes until the tip is about 1 8 inch 0 32 cm from touching the base of the jig place the collar over the top end of the bit so it sits flush on the jig then tighten the collar 11 x research source clamp your board into the jig place your board into the jig so the marks you made are aligned with the jig s guide holes then tighten the clamp to lock it into place you ll be drilling into the side of the board that faces the jig s guide holes so make sure that side won t be visible in your final project 12 x research source for example if you re making a frame make sure you re drilling into the back side of the board instead of what will be the front side of your final project if you ve cut a 45 degree angle into your board to make a miter joint lay the board so the angle sits flat against the base of the jig drill the pilot holes at high speed lock the bit into your power drill and set the drill to its highest speed setting to create cleaner holes insert the bit into one of the jig s guide holes drill to the midpoint between the end of the bit and the collar then pull out the bit to clear out shavings 13 x research source after stopping halfway to eject the shavings insert the bit back into the guide hole and continue drilling until the collar prevents you from drilling any deeper 14 x research source insert your bit into the guide hole lined up with the other side of the board and repeat the process arrange your boards and clamp them at the joint line up your boards to double check you drilled your pilot holes in the right direction apply an even bead of glue to an edge of the boards you re joining press the edges together then tighten a clamp over the joint to lock the boards in place 15 x research source if you drive screws without clamping the boards your joint won t be flush while using screws alone creates a strong joint using woodworking glue will help keep the joint flush during seasonal shrinking and swelling 16 x research source choose the right screws for your project use fine thread pocket hole screws for hardwood lumber and coarse thread screws for softwoods like pine 17 x research source the right screw length depends on your wood s thickness for example 3 4 in 1 9 cm boards require a 1 1 4 in 3 2 cm screw pocket hole screw packaging often includes a guide chart you can also find size guides online 18 x research source use pocket hole screws only they have a built in washer that sits flush with the flat edge created by the pocket hole drill bit drive screws through the pilot holes slowly place the screw in your drill and carefully drive it through the pilot hole until it s tight then drive the next screw into the other pilot hole you drilled remove the clamp when you ve finished driving your screws 19 x research source wipe or scrape away excess glue if glue seeped out from the joint wipe it away with a damp cloth if it s started to set and become jelly like scrape it with a putty knife,Hobbies-and-Crafts

help give your home theatre a polished professional look not to mention it saves space when mounting a projector on the wall or ceiling you ll need to consider a variety of measurements including your screen size and room size as well as your projector s specific throw distance and vertical offset available in its instruction manual use these guidelines in combination with your projector s instruction manual to ensure that you correctly mount it on your ceiling wall,decide on the best location for the screen depending on the layout of your room you may have little choice as to where the screen must go but if possible choose a wall that has no direct light as light on the screen will make the image look washed out 1 x research source if you must choose a wall that receives direct light consider an ambient light rejecting projector screen or if you re painting your screen on the wall you can use ambient light rejecting paint available at hardware stores 2 x research source you might also consider buying blackout curtains for your windows decide on your screen height this will again depend upon the layout of your room if you only have a couch and some chairs in the room i e not theater style seating in rows an appropriate height would be between 24 and 36 inches 61 and 91 5 centimetres off the floor 3 x research source if you have multiple rows in your home theatre you

on how far above the floor to place the screen always keep the screen size in mind as starting it too high off the ground might not leave enough room for the entire screen know your screen size this will be the height and width on which you wish to project the images from your projector keep the measurements handy as you will need them while calculating where to mount your projector most projectors can create a high quality 100 in 254 cm or 8 33 foot image so if you re unsure of what size of screen to get and your room can accommodate it you should be safe with something close to 100 in 5 x research source calculate your projector s throw distance throw distance measures the distance between your screen and your projector s lens you calculate it using your projector s throw ratio which should be listed in the instruction manual as either a single number for projectors without optical zoom or a range of numbers to calculate how far away from your screen to place your projector use the following formula throw ratio x screen width throw distance the formula works for any unit of measurement you can use inches centimeters feet etc if you have a 100 inch screen and a throw ratio range of 1 4 1 to 2 8 1 you can position your projector anywhere between 140 and 280 in 355 6 and 711 2 cm or 11 67 and 23 33 ft from the screen 6 x research source the calculation looks like this using the 1 4 1 ratio as an example 1 4 x 100 in 140 in you can also switch the formula around if you would prefer to choose a screen size that suits where you want to mount your projector follow this formula throw distance divided by throw ratio screen width say you want to place your projector 16 feet away from your screen and your projector has a throw ratio of 1 4 1 to 2 8 1 using the lower end of the ratio 1 4 1 as an example you would divide 16 ft 192 in by 1 4 which equals a screen size of 11 43 ft 137 16 in given that the throw ratio ranges up to 2 8 1 you can actually choose a screen size between 5 71 68 52 in and 11 43 ft determine the best throw distance for your projector once you know your throw distance range you can evaluate the room and decide upon where it makes the most sense to mount the projector things to keep in mind while evaluating seating viewing position if your projector is loud or quite heavy you might not want it hanging right above your head power outlets cabling your projector likely has two cables hdmi and power you ll want to make sure that you re either close enough to your receiver to plug in your projector or that you have the appropriate length cables extensions image preference even within the throw distance range there will be variations in the image quality so you ll want to test out which distance you prefer before finalizing where to mount the projector shorter distances i e projector closer to the screen will be brighter and longer distances i e projector farther from the screen will give more contrast and a sharper image 7 x research source 8 x research source find out your projector s vertical offset the vertical offset of your projector is how high or low it needs to be in order for the image to project at the proper screen height 9 x research source it should appear as a percentage in your projector s manual a positive offset ex 96 3 means the image will project higher than the lens whereas a negative offset ex 96 3 means it will project lower as projectors are mounted upside down positive is the more important offset to pay attention to 10 x research source many projectors are equipped with a vertical lens shift which allows you to adjust the image height without having to move the projector if yours has this try holding your projector at different heights while adjusting the lens shift to see where it works best before mounting it 11 x research source if your projector doesn t have a vertical lens shift i e it has a fixed vertical offset you ll need to place it at exactly the recommended height calculate the vertical placement of your projector to calculate your projector s ideal vertical placement follow this formula screen height x offset percentage distance of lens above below center of screen 12 x research source the following example is for a projector with a 96 3 to 96 3 offset a standard high definition projection screen will have a 1 78 1 16 9 aspect ratio meaning that the screen will be 1 78 times as wide as it is high if your screen is 100 in 8 33 ft wide it will likely be 56 18 in 4 68 ft high to calculate a vertical offset for a 56 18 in screen 56 18 in height x 96 3 offset if your calculate doesn t have a symbol use 0 963 54 10 in this means that the projector can be positioned anywhere from 54 10 in below the center of your screen to 54 10 in above the center of your screen determine horizontal lens shift it s ideal to mount the projector so that it lines up with the center of the screen width wise but if your room layout requires otherwise you ll need to calculate your horizontal lens shift the rules for horizontal lens shift are nearly the same as for vertical lens shift except that you use this formula to determine it screen width x offset percentage distance of lens to left right of screen center 13 x research source it s best to avoid using horizontal lens shift whenever possible as this can distort your image and cause issues with your vertical lens shift 14 x research source decide on the best mount to suit your projector and room projector mounts vary in what they attach to i e ceiling or wall whether they include piping or arms that help with adjusting the height of your image and what type size weight of projector they can hold you ll need to keep all of these things in mind while choosing a mount 15 x research source buy something sturdy and high quality poor quality projectors are more likely to drift over time causing your projector and the image to move out of alignment with the screen 16 x research source you may need to buy adapters for your mount depending upon your ceiling type for a suspended ceiling one that is dropped down from the structural ceiling and thus will be unable to support heavy loads buy a suspended ceiling kit for a cathedral ceiling high and arched purchase a cathedral ceiling adapter attach the mount attach the appropriate mount to the projector follow the instructions that come with the mount kit and the projector make sure that the mount plate is level with the projector once attached before moving on 17 x research source ensure that the entire mount is attached to the projector before securing it to the wall ceiling calculate the mount to lens distance and adjust throw distance accordingly use a tape measure to determine the distance between the center of the mount and the front of the projector s lens add this length to the acceptable range of distances between the projector s lens and the screen i e the throw distance 18 x research source if the mount to lens distance is 6 in the new total for an original throw distance of 16 ft is 16 5 ft secure the projector use a stud finder to locate a ceiling stud also called a joist within the appropriate range of screen to projector distances 19 x expert source jason phillip handyman expert interview 2 july 2020 secure the mount to the stud with a screwdriver wrench and 2 lag bolts lag bolts aka lag screws are fasteners with flat hexagonal heads and threaded cylindrical shafts they can be screwed directly into wood they can also be screwed into concrete when used with an insert called a lag the lag bolts for your projector installation should be 3 in 7 6 cm long and 0 3125 in 7 9 mm wide unless otherwise stated by your mount manual to use a stud finder you simply run it along the wall until its indicator tells you that it s hit a stud more detailed instructions will be in your stud finder s manual if there are no joists available in the location where you want to mount your projector you ll either need to reconsider that spot or first install a piece of wood that spans the space between the two joists if possible i e if there s an attic above you hide the wood inside the ceiling 20 x research source you can also drill through the ceiling put in anchors then screw the projector into that 21 x expert source jason phillip handyman expert interview 2 july 2020 secure the cables attach the cables to the projector follow the instructions in the projector s manual you might consider using wire molds aka cord covers to help your cables blend in with the wall as they run down to your receiver and power outlet these should be available at your local hardware store if you don t mind the look of the cables but would like to at least keep them neat and tidy you can also just fasten them at certain points on your wall using cable supports and fasteners also available at your local hardware store adjust the projector settings to fine tune the image turn on the projector and follow the instruction manual to adjust the zoom lens shift and focus to the desired settings follow the instruction manual to set the desired contrast color and brightness on the projector before going into fine tuning adjust the image so that it is as close to accurate as possible this will ideally save you some time and frustration while fine tuning 22 x research

how to understand camera exposure,to be able to do any of the things that you wanted to do when you bought your digital camera you need to understand exposure while you are able to take some decent pictures right out of the box once you have an understanding of exposure you will find the pictures that you produce surpass the questionable title of snapshots and become photographs and memories,understand what exposure of the image is and how will it affect your photographs exposure is an umbrella term that refers to two aspects of photography it is referring to how to control the lightness and the darkness of the image the exposure is controlled by the camera s light meter the light meter determines what the proper exposure is it all sets the f stop and shutter speed the f stop is a fraction the f represents the focal length the f stop is determined by dividing the focal length by the aperture f 2 8 would be 1 2 8 versus f 16 which would be 1 16 if you look at it like slices of a pie you would get a lot more pie with 1 2 8 than you would with 1 16 this can be very unnerving but f stops and shutter speeds on every picture to get the light right or the lightness and darkness and exposure a good way to understand it is to think of a bucket of water with a hole in the bottom if you have a large hole in the bottom of the bucket large aperture water will drain out quickly fast shutter speed conversely for the same amount of water if you have a small hole in the bottom of the bucket small aperture the water will drain out slowly slow shutter speed exposure or lightness and darkness in the picture is a combination of the f stop which is the size of the hole in the lens and the shutter speed which is the length of time that the shutter is open so if you leave the shutter open longer you re getting more light to the film or more light to the digital sensor and the picture gets brighter or lighter if you shorten the exposure give less light to the film or to the digital sensor the exposure gets darker longer shutter speed more exposure more light shorter shutter speed less exposure less light learn about the f stop f stop also called f number means fraction and the f number is the fraction of the actual opening in the lens compared to the focal length of the lens the aperture is the opening light passes through try this example suppose that you have a lens with a focal length of 50mm and the f number is f 1 8 the f number is determined by focal length aperture so 50 x 1 8 or x 28 the actual diameter where the light comes through the lens is 28mm across if that lens had an f stop of 1 for example the aperture would be 50mm because 50 1 50 that s what the f stop actually means study your digital camera s manual exposure mode in the manual mode you can set both the f stop and shutter speed if you really want to control the light the exposure and how the picture works you need to learn to know how to use the manual exposure mode it s not just for the propeller heads and the guys who still shoot film manual mode is still viable today even with digital because it s really how you control the look and feel of your picture understand why you would want to change the exposure the aperture is really important to control the picture it lets in the light and the light is the most important thing for your picture without light you won t have a picture set the aperture to control both the light and the amount that is in focus in other words the depth of field set a wide opening like f 2 or 2 8 to blur the background and have your subject razor sharp also you ll probably want to use the largest aperture when shooting in low light in order to prevent blur shoot a medium aperture 5 6 or 8 so the subject is sharp and background is slightly out of focus but still recognizable shoot at smaller apertures like f 11 and possibly smaller for a landscape picture when you want the flowers in the foreground the river and the mountains all in focus depending on your format tiny apertures like f 16 and smaller will cause you to lose sharpness due to diffraction effects for many photographers the aperture is far more important to achieving great pictures than the shutter speed because it controls the depth of field of the picture whereas it s more difficult to tell if a picture was shot at 1 250 or 1 1000 of a second understand why you would want to change the iso you change the iso on your digital camera to control the camera s sensitivity to light in bright light we set the camera to be less sensitive to give us a picture with less noise since the shutter speed is fast enough at 100 iso in low light where there s less ambient light you need more sensitivity in the camera therefore raise the iso from 100 to possibly 1600 or even 6400 if you have to to get enough light in so that the picture isn t blurry now what s the payback as you raise the iso you get more noise the film equivalent being grain in the picture and less color so be sure to set the iso as low as possible without having the iso too low that you end up with blurry pictures determine what iso is required for your shot the iso on your digital camera is just like it is on film you used to buy the film by the kind of light you were using today you set the iso on your camera depending on the light how do you set it on some cameras there s a button right on the top of the camera that says iso you press the button turn the dial and change it some cameras you have to go into the menu and find the iso setting click on the iso setting and turn the dial and change it that s how you set the iso on your digital camera stop action by changing the shutter speed on your camera change the shutter speed on your camera to affect the action stopping ability if you re shooting a picture with your camera hand held you will need a shutter speed that as fast as or faster than the reciprocal of your focal length in other words if you were shooting on a 100mm lens a shutter speed of 1 100 of a second would be optimal camera blur can be eliminated at these speeds if you are shooting moving subjects change your shutter speed to a shutter speed that ranges from 1 500 to 1 1000 to stop the moving subjects if shooting pictures in low light where you need more light to come in through the shutter set the shutter speed to a thirtieth or a fifteenth of a second when you do this the action is going to blur so use thirty or fifteen when there s low light or when you want the action to blur medium shutter speed 125 or 250 for most pictures fast shutter speed 500 or 1000 for action thirtieth or a fifteenth of a second to blur action or under low light learn how to change the shutter speed on your digital camera you might have the option of a dial a button on your camera or you may have to do it in camera always err on the side of underexposure of course it goes without saying that you want fantastic exposure but if you can t get it quite right err on the side of underexposure let your scene be a little dark when a picture is over exposed all of the information is lost and cannot be recovered with underexposed pictures you have a greater chance of recovering the picture through post processing you can set your camera to underexpose by using ev compensation exposure value compensation learn your camera s program mode the exposure modes on your camera allows you to control how you adjust the picture the basic mode is the p mode program mode and it allows you to manipulate both the shutter speed or aperture settings and it will adjust the other value accordingly so that the picture is exposed perfectly according to the light meter the advantage of program mode is that you don t need to know anything it s just a little bit above the green auto or idiot proof mode get familiar with the aperture priority mode on your digital camera you have the choice of a mode or aperture priority in the aperture priority mode it s a way to determine the exposure you the photographer picks the aperture or f stop the camera will choose the shutter speed for you aperture priority could be considered the more useful of the modes so you select the f stop whether it s f 2 8 to blur the background f 8 for moderate depth of field or f 16 to have everything in focus investigate your camera s shutter priority mode have at least some familiarity with the shutter speed of your camera the advantage of shutter speed is you set the number that s most convenient or most comfortable to use then the camera will pick the other number the f stop on your camera shutter priority can either be s or tv mode depending on your camera in shutter priority mode pick the shutter speed and the camera sets the f stop when in shutter priority the camera will take the picture at the selected shutter speed regardless of whether or not the picture will be exposed correctly,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tell the difference between planets and stars,the night sky is full of light most of which is generated by celestial bodies like stars and planets if you can t tell whether an object in the sky is a star or planet you ll want to learn how to distinguish between the physical features of these two celestial bodies and when it s best to view them,check if the object twinkles one of the easiest ways to distinguish between stars and planets in the night sky is by looking to see if the object twinkles or shimmers this can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough 1 x research source stars twinkle and shimmer hence the song twinkle twinkle little star planets do not twinkle they remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky if viewed through a telescope planets may appear to wiggle along the edges 2 x research source any object that blinks twinkles or shimmers is most likely a star however it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky note whether the object rises and sets celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky all celestial bodies move but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they re stars or planets 3 x research source planets rise in the east and set in the west they tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon stars move around in the night sky but they do not rise or set instead they orbit in a circular pattern around polaris the north star if the celestial object you see appears to move in a more or less straight line across the night sky it is most likely a planet satellites also move across the night sky but they do so much more quickly than planets a planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes identify the ecliptic planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic this belt is not actually a visible object but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated while stars may also appear along this invisible belt they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance 4 x research source of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars this is due to their proximity to the sun since their brightness is just reflected sunlight the easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the earth the sun s path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic 5 x research source observe the color not all planets are colorful however many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration this can help differentiate the planets from stars while some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range 6 x research source for most people stars appear white to the naked eye 7 x research source mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color 8 x research source venus appears pale yellow mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red this is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of mars which changes on a two year cycle 9 x research source jupiter appears orange with white bands saturn typically appears pale gold in color uranus and neptune appear pale blue however they are not usually visible to the naked eye compare the relative brightness while planets and stars both light up the night sky planets typically appear much brighter than many stars 10 x research source astronomers measure the relative brightness of celestial objects using the astronomical magnitude scale with most of the planets falling in the range of objects that are easily visible to the naked eye 11 x research source planets reflect the bright light of our solar system s sun which is relatively close to the earth stars by contrast emit their own light while some stars may be much brighter and larger than our sun these stars are much farther from the earth than the planets in our solar system because of this the planets which reflect our sun s light typically appear brighter from the earth bring star charts and planetary guides whether you have poor night vision or are simply confused about the location of certain celestial bodies a chart or guide can help you determine where to look you can purchase star charts and planetary guides from a bookstore print out free guides from the internet or download a star planetary guide app on your smartphone 12 x research source remember that star charts are usually only valid for a limited period of time typically about one month that s because the position of stars in the sky changes over time as the earth continues along its orbit if you consult a star chart or planetary guide out in the field make sure you use a dim red flashlight these flashlights are designed to provide light without affecting your eyes ability to adjust to the darkness get a good telescope or binoculars if stargazing with the naked eye isn t getting you enough celestial body views you may want to consider using a telescope or binoculars these instruments can help assist your view by magnifying the area you look at this can make visible objects clearer and can even bring objects invisible to the naked eye into your view 13 x research source some experts recommend getting familiar with celestial bodies using the naked eye then trying binoculars and finally moving up to using a telescope this can help you get more acclimated to the visible bodies and their place in the night sky compare telescopes and binoculars online before you invest in one read the reviews written by people who have owned a given model by searching online for the model you re interested in visit a dark sky site light pollution from urban areas can drastically limit your ability to see celestial bodies in the night sky to really maximize visibility you may want to consider visiting a dark sky site 14 x research source these designated sites have been identified by the international dark sky association ida as places worth protecting against encroaching light pollution and urban development 15 x research source common dark sky sites include state and national parks though other dark sky sites are surrounded by well lit well developed regions check the ida website to find a dark sky site near you check whether an occultation is scheduled an occultation is when the moon passes between the earth and a given star or planet obstructing that celestial body s visibility these obstructions happen somewhat regularly and can easily be planned around since their occurrence is predictable 16 x research source occultations may be visible from some locations on earth and not from others check in advance to see whether an occultation is scheduled and whether your visibility will be significantly affected you can find out about planned occultations by searching online or by consulting an astronomy guide the international occultation timing association publishes their predictions online for free 17 x research source identify the moon s phase light reflected off the moon can inhibit your ability to see stars and planets if it is close to a full moon you may have a hard time observing celestial bodies for this reason it s best to check on the current phase of the moon before venturing out to observe the night sky 18 x research source if you aren t sure about the moon s current phase you can consult an online guide to the moon s phases for free the u s navy s website allows you to check moon phases by date as far in advance as the year 2100 19 x research source find the right conditions knowing how to distinguish between stars and planets will only get you so far if the night sky is not very visible your ability to see celestial bodies can be limited by a number of factors both man made and naturally occurring 20 x research source light pollution is one of the biggest limiting factors of night sky visibility if you live in or near a metropolitan area you will probably need to travel to a more rural area to increase visibility cloud cover and significant snow cover can both affect night sky visibility if it s very cloudy or if the ground is significantly covered in snow you may have a hard time seeing celestial bodies in the sky avoid other limiting factors there are many other factors can also affect night sky visibility including some that you might be inflicting upon yourself for example your level of alcohol consumption your nicotine consumption and your pupil dilation at the time of viewing can all affect your ability to see celestial bodies these factors all affect your eyes ability to adjust to the dark and identify stars and planets in the night sky 21 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the andromeda galaxy,the andromeda galaxy also known as messier 31 or the great spiral galaxy is one of the most distant objects that the unaided human eye can see use the constellations around the andromeda galaxy to help you pinpoint its location in the sky you can see the galaxy faintly with your eyes but binoculars or a telescope will make it clearer to maximize your view go out on a dark night in autumn or winter locating it for the first time is a little tricky but once you find it it s hard to ever lose it again,go away from the lights of the city any light pollution can make it difficult to find the andromeda galaxy it is best to go away from any urban areas street lights or lit parks take a hike onto a mountain go out into an isolated field or find another area without any light pollution 1 x research source adapt your eyes to the dark the andromeda galaxy is not as bright as other stars around it when you go out to stargaze give yourself fifteen minutes to adjust to the darkness you may realize that you can see more stars than you could at first 2 x research source use a star chart to determine where the galaxy will appear in the sky the position of galaxies stars and constellations can change with the seasons look for a star chart designed for the current month you can often find star charts for free online they are also sometimes sold at planetariums or by astronomical societies the star chart may also tell you what the best of time night to see the andromeda galaxy is based on the season for example in september and october the andromeda galaxy will rise in the eastern sky of the northern hemisphere by midnight it should be directly above your head 3 x research source if you live in the southern hemisphere you might look towards the northern horizon in december to see it it may not rise high in the sky 4 x research source download a stargazing app there are many apps that can help you find the andromeda galaxy and other stars these will adjust the star charts based on your position hemisphere season and time of night these include the star chart app nightsky app and goskywatch locate the cassiopeia constellation if you can find the big dipper look for the bright star next to it this is called polaris or the north star across polaris from the big dipper will be cassiopeia cassiopeia contains five stars in a w shape the right side of this w will point down directly at the andromeda galaxy 5 x research source find the pegasus and andromeda constellations pegasus looks like a giant rectangle you should see two lines of stars extending from the upper left hand corner of this star this is the andromeda constellation keep in mind that the andromeda constellation is separate from the andromeda galaxy look between pegasus and cassiopeia for a smudge the andromeda galaxy lies between the pegasus constellation and the point of cassiopeia it should look like a blur or a hazy oval in the sky draw a line through the mirach and mu andromedae stars start at the star on the upper left hand corner of pegasus the constellation andromeda begins here follow andromeda down two stars you should see two stars stacked on top of one another called mirach and mu andromedae if you draw a line through the two stars and extend it past mu andromedae you should run into the andromeda galaxy 6 x research source mu andromedae is dimmer than mirach it is also the star closest to the andromeda galaxy look for the companion galaxies if you are using a telescope you may find two faint fuzzy spots beside the galaxy one of them m32 is smaller in size and closer to the actual galaxy core the other ngc 205 is larger in size and farther from the actual galaxy both are companion galaxies to andromeda 7 x research source start by locating the galaxy with your naked eye you can see the andromeda galaxy without any special tools it will look like a faint fuzzy oval in the night sky once you have found the area of the sky where the galaxy is located it may be easier to find it with binoculars or a telescope 8 x research source use binoculars for a closer look binoculars will give you a closer look at the galaxy once you find the galaxy with your eye bring the binoculars up slowly and adjust your view until you can find the galaxy it should look like an oval cloud when viewed through binoculars 9 x research source you can use normal binoculars for this the best binoculars to use have 7x50 8x40 or 10x50 lenses 10 x research source use a telescope for a more detailed examination a typical 8 inches 20 cm reflector telescope will let you see nucleus or center of the galaxy as well as its two companion galaxies the galaxy is so large that you may not be able to see the whole thing at once using your telescope 11 x research source if you are using a telescope keep it at the lowest magnification settings while the andromeda galaxy appears quite small to the naked eye it will appear very large when using a telescope look for the andromeda galaxy in fall or winter in the northern hemisphere the best time to view the andromeda galaxy is between august and september in the southern hemisphere you can see it between october and december during these seasons andromeda will appear as soon as the sky darkens 12 x research source it is possible to view the andromeda galaxy all year long in the northern hemisphere although it may be more difficult to find in other seasons 13 x research source choose a night without a moon the moon can also dim your view of the stars you will have the clearest view of the andromeda galaxy if you go out during the new moon or a crescent moon 14 x research source if the moon is full it may be difficult to find the andromeda galaxy a new moon occurs once a month use an online lunar calendar to find the best night for stargazing this month check the weather for a cloudless evening any clouds in the sky will obstruct your view of the stars look at weather reports before you head out to make sure that there will be no cloud cover,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the big dipper,the big dipper is perhaps the most famous grouping of stars in the sky it is part of a bigger constellation of stars called ursa major or the big bear and it features in the legends of many cultures it can help you with navigation and telling time it s not very difficult to spot if you know what you re looking for,find the right spot position yourself in a location where there is not bright lighting you will have a better chance of spotting the big dipper in an area not polluted with light you also should position yourself in a spot where the northern horizon is clear 1 x research source wait until darkness falls you aren t going to find the big dipper during the daytime the best viewing time is between march and june and around 10 p m 2 x research source look north to find the big dipper you need to look into the northern sky determine which direction is north using a magnetic compass or a map tilt your head back so that you are looking up at the sky at about a 60 degree angle during midsummer and autumn the big dipper will be closer to the horizon so don t look up quite so high if you are located north of little rock arkansas you should be able to see the big dipper all night at any hour and any day of the year 3 x research source if you live as far north as new york or further north the big dipper should never sink below the horizon in southern locations it can be more difficult to see the full big dipper in the fall when some of its stars may be obscured determine seasonal differences the season matters here if it s spring or summer the big dipper will be higher in the sky if it s fall or winter the big dipper will be closer to the horizon the saying spring up and fall down will help you remember where to look for the big dipper in the fall the big dipper will rest on the horizon in evening in the winter the handle can appear to be dangling from the bowl you will find the big dipper upside down in the spring and in the summer the bowl will lean toward the ground spot the big dipper the big dipper is shaped like a bowl and a handle there are three stars in the big dipper s handle organized in a line there are 4 stars that make up the big dipper s bowl it looks like an irregular square the entire big dipper looks somewhat like a kite with the string being the handle and the bowl being the kite itself the last two stars of the big dipper s handle are called the pointers they are called dubhe and merak the brightest star is alioth which is the third star on the handle closest to the bowl 4 x research source the tip of the big dipper s handle is called alkaid it is a hot star that means the leader it is the third brightest star in ursa major and six times bigger than the sun mizar is next on the handle after alkaid it actually consists of two double stars megrez is the star that connects the tail to the base of the bowl it is the dimmest of the seven stars of the big dipper phecda is known as the thigh of the bear it is located to the south of megrez and makes up part of the bow find the north star if you can find the north star you should be able to find the big dipper and vice versa the north star is usually bright to find it look into the north sky up about one third of the way from the horizon to the top of the sky which is called the zenith the north star is also called polaris the big dipper rotates around the north star through all of the seasons and through the night the stars of the big dipper are as bright as those of the north star the north star is often used for navigation because it points true north 5 x research source the north star is the brightest star in the little dipper and the end of its handle trace an imaginary line from the north star downward and you should be able to find the two stars in the end of the big dipper s handle which are called pointer stars because they point toward the big dipper polaris is about five stars farther away from the distance between the pointer stars themselves use the big dipper to tell time the big dipper is what is called circumpolar this means it doesn t rise or set like the sun instead it rotates around the north celestial pole throughout the night it rotates around the pole counter clockwise bowl first it makes a complete revolution around the pole once per sidereal day a sidereal day is defined as four minutes shorter than the standard 24 hour day thus you can use the big dipper s rotations to keep track of time 6 x research source study big dipper lore some native americans saw the bowl of the big dipper as a bear the stars of the handle were three warriors chasing it 7 x research source other native americans saw the big dipper s bowl as the bear s flank and its handle as the bear s tail in the united kingdom and ireland the big dipper is called plough which derives from nordic stargazing in which the big dipper was believed to be the chief god odin s wagon or chariot in danish they call it karlsvogna or charles wagon various cultures see the big dipper as something different in china japan and korea it s a ladle in northern england a cleaver in germany and hungary a cart and in the netherlands a saucepan it s a salmon net in finland and a coffin in saudi arabia escaped american slaves found their way to freedom in the north along the underground railroad by being told to follow the drinking gourd thus the big dipper was used as a navigational method the micmacs of canada saw the big dipper bowl as being a celestial bear with the three stars of its handle being hunters chasing the bear learn the big dipper stars distances from earth the stars that make up the big dipper are part of the ursa major moving cluster the furthest star from earth alkaid makes up the handle and is 210 light years from earth the other stars are dubhe 105 light years from earth phecda 90 light years mizar 88 light years merak 78 light years alioth 68 light years and megrez 63 light years these starts are in motion thus in about 50 000 years the big dipper will no longer retain the same shape use the north star to find the little dipper once you ve found the big dipper you should be able to easily spot the little dipper remember that the two farthest most stars in the big dipper s handle point to the north star the north star is the first star in the handle of the little dipper the little dipper is not as bright as the big dipper it looks similar to the big dipper though it has a handle made up of three stars that connects to a four star bowl it is harder to find the little dipper because the stars are not as bright in it especially if you are in a city use the big dipper to find ursa major the big dipper is what is called an asterism that means it is a pattern of stars that is not a constellation it is part of the constellation ursa major the big bear the big dipper stars are the bear s tail and hindquarters the ursa major constellation can be best seen in april at around 9 p m using a drawing for reference there are many online should help you sketch out the rest of the stars that form the big bear once you find the big dipper 8 x research source 9 x research source ursa

how to play a coined spirit game,spirit of the coin is a fun spooky game similar to the ouija board the spirit of the coin uses a talking board to contact spirits and communicate with them you just need a coin a piece of paper and a pen then you re ready to turn out the lights and talk to the dead just remember not to upset the spirits,find a large white sheet of paper a pen and a coin the paper should be no smaller than an 8 by 11 to allow room to write everything on the game board and allow enough room for the coin to move you can use any coin but choosing a silver coin may help to repel the evil spirits write the alphabet around the edges of the paper this will allow the spirit to spell out answers to your questions if you want you can draw them in a similar pattern to the ouija board draw a n arched along the top and the o z along the bottom the shape the letters make on the paper would be similar to an oval on the paper write numbers 0 9 across the center of the paper 1 x research source some questions may require a numerical answer you may want to find out how old the spirit is or when they were alive add words such as start end yes or no these will provide easier answer options to simple questions it s always faster to ask a yes or no question than one that requires more explanation you can use the start and end options to call a spirit or end the game choose a dark room for playing this game do not turn on the lights most often this game is played at night as spirits are said to be more active late in the day light one or more candles so that you can see the board 2 x research source sit in a circular arrangement around the board set the coin on the board at start each one of the persons should keep a finger on the coin do not push the coin invite the spirits begin by asking a question that can be answered with a yes or a no the coin will begin to move when the spirit answers it may take a few minutes for the coin to warm up just be patient 3 x research source pose questions to the spirit and receive answers from the moving coin on the alphabets these answers may be spelled out quickly you may want to have someone write down the answers that isn t touching the coin remain respectful of the spirits thank them for talking to you don t automatically believe the board spirits are not always going to speak the truth at the end place the coin on the end or go option and that would end the game you need to let the spirits know the session is over and it is time to go be sure to remove the coin from the paper and put the paper away you don t want to risk letting the spirits escape,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to miter corners,if you want to hide the end grain of a board a miter joint is the joint to make miter joints are decorative joints used for picture frames door and window trim and around openings miter joints are weak joints but useful when you want something to look nice without needing it to support a lot of weight just get started with step 1 below to make your own,get the right cutting and measuring tools there are a couple of different tools that you can use to miter corners and what you can use will depend on what you re cutting and how it needs to be cut basic standard cuts can be done on simple materials using a miter box and a hand saw more complex cuts will need a circular or table saw these can be rented from your local big box hardware store and they can advise on exactly which type of machine you need 1 x research source for many interior molding situations such as baseboard and crown etc you should not miter the inside corners it won t fit right and miters tend to separate in these situations for inside corners you should learn a technique called coping this is not difficult do a search for instructions determine your miter angle measure the complete angle change divide that by the number of pieces that will make the turn the resulting number is the angle to which you will need to set your miter the most common miter angle is 45 degrees 2 x research source measure for your starting points since the cuts are angled you ll have one side of the wood longer than the other you ll need to keep track of which side will be which and make your measurements correctly for example on an inside corner piece the measurement of the wall will need to equal the longer back side of the wood for an outside corner piece the inside will need to be equal to the wall but will b the shorter distance measure for your angle gap if you want to make use of as much wood as possible you ll want to be able to use scraps whenever you can because the piece will need to be longer on one side then what might actually appear such as on inside corners you ll need to be able to calculate how much extra material you ll need at the end if your mitered corner is at the standard 45 degree angle 360 2 corners then you ll need a gap at the end equal to the depth of the piece of wood if you re using a non 45 angle you ll need to do some math don t worry it s easier than it sounds use a calculator or the interactive circle on this page to find the sin and cos for the angle of the cut you re making next take your calculator and divide the sin by the cos take the resulting number and multiply it by the depth of your wood the resulting number is how much extra space you ll need line up the saw set the miter saw to the angle it will need to cut at use the included instructions for your machine as each is different line up the wood place the wood on the machine so that it is upside down when possible always make sure you know where the short and long sides of your wood need to be make use of a laser guide if your machine has one most newer machines do if you re unsure about how a piece of wood is lined up keep scrap wood handy to test the cut on testing is important 3 x research source when cutting a picture frame style cut place the flat side on the cutting surface when cutting a box style cut place the flat side against the fence or back piece of the cutting surface clamp the wood in place if you are not using a piece long enough to hold and have your hands well out of the way of the saw you should use clamps to hold the wood in place seriously a lot of people lose fingers this way be careful 4 x research source start and lower the saw usually there are a series of buttons and actions you have to take to start and lower the saw follow the instructions that came with the machine you have when you lower the saw keep your hands away and do not press down very hard simply guide it to where it needs to go and let the saw do the cutting raise the saw and wait for the blade to stop moving once it s done you can unclamp and remove your piece use clamps no matter what method of joining you use using clamps to keep the joint steady while it sets in important there are lots of different styles of clamps depending on what project you re working on see your local hardware store for help choosing what s right for you 5 x research source use glue and nails the most basic way to join the pieces is to glue the angles fit them together and then nail them into place using a pneumatic brad nailer this works best if the pieces can be nailed onto something else like a door frame because the ends will not hold together well set the nails if they do not go in far enough with a nail setter then fill the holes with wood putty and stain or paint the putty to match the wood 6 x research source use dowels you can drill dowel holes and place dowels in the joined ends of the wood if it is thick enough this can add support and make the joint much stronger simply drill the hole cover a dowel in wood glue and join the pieces use a dowel size appropriate to the thickness of your wood 7 x research source use a notch joint once the ends are joined you can also try a notch joint using a thick circular saw cut a notch in the corner of the joint then fill the notch with glue and fit in a triangular shim cut to the correct size and shape this is a more advanced method but can be beautiful if done correctly,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to create a time capsule,time capsules are fun to make and even more fun to open years down the line a time capsule can be any container that holds objects meant for people to open in the future whether that be in 5 10 or even 100 years a good time capsule will hold its contents safely preserving them for a future version of yourself your grandchildren or even a stranger soon you will have the skills to create a time capsule that will thrill and fascinate someone in the future,choose an audience for your time capsule think about who your time capsule is for this will help you pick contents a location for the capsule and a container whether you plan to open the capsule yourself you would rather have your grandchildren open it or you want a stranger from the distant future to stumble upon it you should be clear about your intent if you are struggling to find an audience think about what kind you would most like to open do you wish your grandparents had left you a time capsule filled with memorabilia and handwritten notes does the thought of opening a 150 year old capsule left by someone lost to time long ago thrill you make a list of possible objects to include for your audience depending on your audience you may have different priorities for your contents you can always collect more objects for your time capsule than you end up putting in your only limits are space and the ability of your capsule contents to be safely stored 1 x research source if the capsule is for yourself focus on personal mementos of your life as it is right now things like a pair of earbuds you wore every day for 2 years an old key or a takeout menu from a favorite restaurant will bring memories back in just a few years for a time capsule that you plan to pass down to your children or grandchildren find things that will interest them about your life and your world both personal objects of significance to you and your family like wedding invitations and things that depict the state of the world like technology are good choices if your capsule is for people in the far future to uncover long after you are gone focus on the era you are in things that may seem to be of little value now may be fascinating to someone in 75 or 100 years put toys in the capsule for kids if you are making the time capsule with children or for future children toys and simple games can be a way to excite kids about the experience of course don t lock a child s favorite toy away for years and years but a handful of toys from when they were younger can help them get interested toys can change over the years more than you might think and for a child they can be fondly remembered years later pick out some current newspapers or magazines for a more general audience print media showing current events or trends is a good choice to carry into the future a sense of what it was like to be alive in your era you can even cut out headlines or articles from the day the capsule will be put in its resting place 2 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source be sure to keep the paper in plastic sleeves to ensure that it is preserved store journals letters and photographs for a personal touch whether or not the time capsule is for you and your family many people find it rewarding to read messages between people from the past journals and photographs each provide a captivating look at another person s life as well 3 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source these are especially vulnerable to damage so protect them in special archival sheets if the capsule will last more than 5 years choose any other objects that are compact and non perishable there is no limit to what you can keep in a time capsule so long as it will fit and won t reach its expiration date before you want it to be opened most food and drink are not great candidates for your time capsule as they are likely to rot or spoil before the opening date if you are out of ideas for what to put in your time capsule run through your daily activities in your head what objects do you use what do you look at what do you read asking yourself these questions can give you many new ideas write and enclose a letter if desired this gives you an opportunity to tell your future audience about daily life current fads fashions attitudes and trends what you think the future might look like and anything else that you would like to say you can also mention your intentions in creating the capsule 4 x research source write the letter as though it were addressed directly to whoever will open the capsule this will give it a much more personal feeling than a letter that is closer to a list of facts than a piece of communication make an inventory of everything in the capsule write down all of the contents and place the list in the capsule and in your records this will help future openers know that everything is in place and help you remember what you put in the capsule 5 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source choose a duration for your time capsule for a personal time capsule 10 to 30 years may be enough whereas a generational time capsule meant for your grandchildren may need to last 60 to 70 years if you want your capsule to be opened at an even later date you will want to start planning the logistics it s okay to not have a specific date for the capsule to be opened maybe you want to open it when you are married or reach retirement plan for the worst wear and tear no matter wear you plan to store your time capsule damage could ruin the contents before anyone ever sees them you should keep the contents wrapped separately from one another and choose a container that can withstand worse than it is likely to endure 6 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source use a shoebox bin or old suitcase for a short term indoor option if your capsule is only supposed to last 5 to 10 years a simple everyday container will keep the contents safely tucked away and easily portable without the risk of outdoor stowing keep in mind that a capsule made of cardboard or paper may be completely destroyed by fire flood or other natural disaster use a coffee canister for a simple short term choice if you have a used coffee tin around the aluminum will hold up below ground for around 10 years to avoid getting water past the lid bury the container inside a ziploc bag or other airtight plastic wrapping 7 x research source select a highly weatherproof for long term stowage if you plan to place the time capsule outdoors or bury the time capsule select a container that is likely to survive like a commercial or home built aluminum stainless steel or pvc plastic capsule 8 x research source one example of a sturdy home built pvc container is a pvc tube with an end cap attached with pvc cement and a test cap lid that can be screwed tightly into the pipe 9 x research source consider using desiccant gel bags such as those included in the packaging of electronic goods and in bottles of vitamin tablets these help to absorb any moisture that may have been present at the time of encapsulation and help to kill microbes that may make some of your items perish use your imagined audience to decide where to put the capsule if you are planning on opening the time capsule yourself you may be able to store it in your own home or buried in your backyard for an audience in the future aside from your family a spot that is off of private property may be best be sure to store your outdoor capsule in a place that is safe from development and construction like just outside a national park or landmark particularly if you choose to bury it choose burial for a traditional time capsule approach while burial may not be the best choice for several reasons it is certainly the classic way to store your capsule buried capsules are very likely to be forgotten or lost and being underground makes the contents much more susceptible to damage from moisture 10 x research source another positive side of underground storage is that it is less likely to be removed or opened early as it might be indoors outdoor storage has a better chance of staying in one place store your time capsule indoors for a safer alternative out of the elements indoor time capsules are a secure alternative to storing them underground while they may be more tempting to open and a little less captivating than buried time capsules you should still consider an indoor approach for shorter term storage choose an outdoor above ground option for a fun challenge one interesting alternative is to store your time capsule items in a stainless steel vacuum food jar hidden inside a camouflaged polyurethane hollow rock or log 11 x research source these above ground time capsules are called geocapsules and can provide a further level of adventure to the time capsule experience mark the container with the current date and the intended opening date this ensures that the opener knows the exact origin of your time capsule and if they found it unintentionally knows when to open it 12 x research source avoid using ink to mark the outside of a buried capsule an engraving would hold up best but weather grade paint is another good option noting these dates on the outside and inside of the capsule creates extra assurance do something to remind yourself or others about the time capsule at minimum you will need to record the location and intended opening date on paper digitally and in a secure location if you keep a calendar set reminders each year or schedule an email to be sent to you on a certain date 13 x research source consider writing the location and opening date in your will or leave a letter with a grandchild containing instructions make extra arrangements for a time capsule that will outlive you if your time capsule is intended for retrieval years or decades after its original placement make doubly sure that several people know of its exact location and surroundings ask them to hold the information for safekeeping passing it along if necessary take photographs of your placement identify gps coordinates and write down all data important for relocating the precise location register the time capsule to make it feel more official and give the capsule a higher chance of being found if all else fails 14 x research source seal the time capsule and store it be sure to seal it tightly and completely remember to use a plastic bag on the outside as well for outdoor storage if it s a personal time capsule the hard part will be resisting the urge to open it but soon you will forget all about it until you are reminded 15 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source place a marker of some kind on the exact site of a buried capsule even if it is just a painted rock keeping some kind of visible yet not overt sign of the spot to dig for the

how to fold an american flag,the national flag of the united states of america which is commonly known as the american flag is a source of pride for americans when it s not on display the flag should be folded into a triangle after you ve taken down your flag fold it lengthwise next fold it into a triangle for display or storage,lower the flag down the flagpole slowly not letting it touch the ground loosen the line and pull the cords to bring the flag back toward the ground do this slowly and in a reverent manner showing your respect toward the flag 1 x research source gather the flag as it gets close to the ground slide the flag off the line then secure the line in place on the pole 2 x research source it s best to fold the flag near the pole to reduce the risk of dropping all or part of it make sure no part of the flag touches the ground at any time letting the flag touch the ground is a sign of disrespect against the flag as you fold the flag keep it completely off the ground by either working with a partner or folding it on a clean dry surface 3 x research source for example you might lay the flag out on your dinner table face up lay the flag out on a table if you re working alone the flag should be face up with the field of blue at the top make sure the flag is smooth and wrinkle free 4 x research source if you re working with a partner hold the flag parallel to the ground at waist height each partner will hold one corner of the flag fold your flag so that the bottom stripes are over the field of stars you will bring the bottom edge up then align it with the top edge the two edges will meet while the bottom will now be a fold check that the flag is completely smooth with no unevenness or wrinkles 5 x research source if you re working with a partner adjust your hands so that each partner is holding the layered corners in one hand and the middle fold in the other bring the folded edge up to the top edge to create a second fold the field of stars should be visible on both sides of the folded flag at this point check that both sides of the flag have the field of blue on the left and the stripes on the right 6 x research source if you re working with a partner each person will be holding 2 corners and a folded edge in one hand in their other hand they will hold the bottom folded edge create a triangle fold by bending the striped corner up to the top edge the outside edge of the folded flag should be aligned with the top edge the fold itself will look like a triangle check that the flag doesn t have any wrinkles 7 x research source each side of the triangle should be an equal length fold the pointed corner over to form a second triangle the edge of the first triangle will stay aligned with the edge of the folded flag the flag should once again look like a rectangle 8 x research source make sure the fold is wrinkle free continue making triangle folds down the length of the flag in total you will make 13 folds including the first 2 on the last fold only the blue field will be visible 9 x trustworthy source us department of veterans affairs u s government agency providing healthcare and resources to veterans go to source the 13 folds symbolize the original 13 colonies additionally each fold is assigned a special meaning as explained here http www usflag org foldflag html each triangle should be evenly sized tuck the end of the flag into the open fold the edge of the field of blue can be tucked into the open fold on the side of the triangle only the field of blue should be visible on either side of the flag the triangle shape is used to honor the 3 corner hat traditionally worn by the revolutionaries who fought for american independence 10 x research source display the flag in a triangle shaped display case many people love to display the flag especially if it s a flag given in honor of a loved one you can place your folded flag in a container designed for displaying the flag this is a reverent way to display the flag with honor 11 x research source for example veterans families often receive a flag following the veteran s funeral this flag will be placed over the coffin then folded to be presented to the family you can store this flag in a display case to remember your family member you can purchase a case online or at a store that sells flags store the flag in a clean dry place you might place it in a drawer or closet keep it separate from other items so it doesn t get mixed in with your everyday linens it s a good idea to put the flag in a case or plastic container before you store it this will protect it from dirt and dust make sure the flag is secure in its spot place the flag somewhere it won t fall or get mixed up with other linens you might put it in a secure drawer or keep it in its case at all times if you re displaying the flag make sure it s properly hung or its display case is on a sturdy shelf you don t want your flag to fall out of its storage place or become damaged it s disrespectful to the flag if it becomes dirty or damaged during storage similarly you don t want the flag to fall out of the spot and touch the ground 12 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to play marbles,nothing s more fun than a game of marbles with friends you can join in on this classic pastime as long as you have a friend some chalk and plenty of marbles to compete with you can play a traditional game of marbles or try out a less familiar variant like bulls eye or cherry pit no matter what you choose you re guaranteed a fun game that has been enjoyed for thousands of years 1 x research source,draw a circle on the pavement in chalk a traditional chalk circle should be around 3 feet 0 9 meters across this will be your marble ring during the game draw the circle as evenly you can to ensure a fair game 2 x research source use string as an alternative if you are playing marbles indoors choose a shooter marble your shooter or taw marble will be what you use to knock other marbles out of the circle later choose a marble bigger than all your other marbles so it has plenty of power qualities of a good shooter marble also include a heavier weight and balanced symmetry 3 x research source other names for the shooter marble include aggie boulder steele king and middleman 4 x research source use a big marble as your shooter so it is easier to knock the marbles out place ten to fifteen marbles in the center of the ring space the marbles so that they evenly fill the ring but try to place the majority nearer to the center how many marbles you choose depends on how large of a game you want the more you place the longer the game will last 5 x research source decide whether you want to play for keeps marbles can be played either for fair which means that every player keeps their marbles or for keeps if you choose to play for keeps marbles can be won by other players by knocking them out of the ring choose how you re playing in advance so you know what to expect while playing 6 x research source never let another person trick you into playing for keeps if you are a beginner determine who will go first draw a line in the ground with your chalk then stand about 10 feet 3 04 meters away from your line have each player take turns flicking their shooter at the line the player whose marble lands closest to the line goes first with second third fourth etc going as follows this method of determining the playing order is called lagging alternatively you can decide with a coin flip or by playing rock paper scissors kneel outside of the ring and shoot your taw marble from the ground your objective is to knock marbles out of the ring to shoot your marble correctly fold your thumb pinkie and ring finger into your palm roll your pointer finger around the marble holding it against your thumb knuckle when you re ready to shoot flick your thumb out 7 x research source use your dominant hand to shoot the marble 8 x research source some variations of the game give a penalty like losing a turn if you touch the chalk circle with your knees while shooting decide with your friends whether you want to play with this penalty grab any marbles you knocked out don t wait until the end of the game to gather your marbles as you might not remember which ones your shooter got out pick them up right after your turn and gather them in a neat pile 9 x research source some variations of the game state that if you got a marble out it is still your turn ask the other players whether they want to follow this rule 10 x research source leave your shooter marble in the ring if you don t knock out any marbles you will shoot from within the ring during your next turn using the same shooting method as before if your marble is moved within the ring by another player you will play from wherever it lands 11 x research source decide with your friends whether you want to add a penalty for those who move their shooter marble by accident while it s in the ring knock the other player s shooter marble out for a quick win if your opponent s shooter marble is within the ring it s vulnerable to being knocked out players whose shooter marbles are knocked out automatically lose the game if this person was the only other player besides yourself you win the game by default 12 x research source because shooter marbles are bigger and heavier they are generally harder to knock out than other marbles continue knocking out marbles until none are left in the ring unless your game ends abruptly by knocking other shooters out this is the only way to end the game most marble games last from between fifteen and thirty minutes 13 x research source count up how many marbles you knocked out each marble usually equals one point if you re playing with marbles of different colors or sizes you may want to assign points to each marble type depending on difficulty when you ve finished counting your marbles write the number down or keep it safe in your memory compare your score with your opponent if you chose not to play for keeps determine another prize for the winner perhaps bragging rights are enough but players often commit to each giving the winner a marble of the losers choice once you ve finished play another round or wrap up the game play bulls eye marbles draw four circles each within the next one and assign each circle a points amount give each player an allotted amount of marbles and take turns shooting them into the ring once everyone has shot their marbles count up your scores to determine a winner write down the points on a piece of paper and add them up to ensure accuracy play cherry pit dig a one foot 0 3 meter wide hole into a smooth dry patch of dirt take turns flicking your marbles as closely to the hole as you can without dropping it in the player whose marble comes closest to the hole without falling wins 14 x research source for added challenge make knocking your opponents marbles into the hole allowed play dropsies dropsies is a played shooter marble versus shooter marble but is otherwise similar to the traditional game of marbles draw a chalk circle and place both of your shooter marbles inside take turns trying to knock your opponent s marble out of the ring the first player whose shooter leaves the circle loses 15 x research source collect marbles for fun when you re not playing with marbles collect a variety of marbles in all shapes and sizes the more marbles you collect the better selection you ll have when you re playing a game keep your marbles in a pouch to avoid losing one accidentally 16 x research source trade your marbles with friends to expand your collection avoid using your most special marbles in any games especially if you re playing for keeps,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to dry maple wood,maple is one of the strongest hardwoods and has a fine consistent grain that gives it a uniform beautiful appearance it s a highly valued wood for flooring cabinets and furniture but freshly cut maple needs to be properly dried before you can use it fortunately it s actually really easy to dry maple wood all you need to do is give the wood the right conditions and enough time to dry without warping or cracking and you ll be able to use it for whatever you want,look for a flat shady location if you re drying outside if you plan to air dry your maple wood outside find a flat spot of ground so you re able to make an even stack choose a location out of direct sunlight such as beneath of group of trees or under a roof so the heat and uv radiation doesn t dry the wood unevenly which can warp it and cause it to crack 1 x research source try to avoid low spots that gather water as well so the wood doesn t sit in standing water when it rains if the ground is uneven use a tamper or plate compactor to even it out don t choose a sunny spot and plan to cover the wood with a tarp or sheet the covering can trap moisture which can cause mold and bacteria to grow on the wood the moisture can also affect how the wood dries choose a shed if you want to keep the wood covered if you want to keep your maple wood out of the elements then an outdoor shed is a great option clear out the shed so you have room to stack your wood and make sure the floor isn t damaged or cracked so the stack won t sink or fall through it 2 x research source you can also purchase an outdoor shed from your local home improvement store to use as a drying space lay down a plastic sheet to keep the wood dry and clean whether you re air drying in outside or in a shed cover the floor with a plastic sheet to keep the wood dry and to prevent any debris or plant growth that could affect airflow make sure the sheet is laid out smoothly and there aren t any wrinkles 3 x research source if grass or weeds grow around the wood they can affect the drying process use a dehumidification kiln for the quickest option a dehumidification kiln is a sealed chamber that maintains a set temperature and humidity level that is optimal for drying wood if you have access to a kiln use it to dramatically reduce the time it takes your maple wood to dry 4 x research source a dehumidification kiln can dry wood in as little as 2 months whereas it may take 3 4 years to air dry you can hire a contractor to build a proper dehumidification kiln on your property dehumidification kilns can cost between 1 200 5 000 usd and come in a variety of sizes that can hold different amounts of wood if you plan to dry a lot of maple wood you may want to invest in one gather the maple wood as soon as it s cut down gather maple logs and trees for processing and drying as soon as you can after they ve been cut down or knocked down by a storm to help prevent rot or stains place the lumber near where you plan to process it so you re able to do it all at once 5 x research source for instance if you plan to process the wood on your property have it delivered or haul it near where you re going to cut it opening up the wood soon after it s felled helps it dry better pull off any bark from the logs to prevent decay pull off the mark from the maple tree so fungal growth won t decay or deteriorate the wood which can damage and discolor it remove all of the bark from the lumber so you ve got a clean smooth surface 6 x research source wear a sturdy pair of work gloves to make it easier to grip the bark without hurting your hands you can also use a drawknife to shave off the bark saw the logs into 4 by 4 inches 10 by 10 cm boards if you re using a circular saw cut the log into quarters and then saw the boards out of the quarters if you re using a bandsaw push the logs through the saw to cut the boards out of them use a ruler or tape measure to measure out the boards so they re uniform 7 x research source if you handsaw the boards the wood may not dry evenly make sure the boards are the same size so they re easier to stack and they dry evenly discard boards with branches or knots uneven boards can warp and crack as it dries which can also affect the wood stacked above and below it discard boards with knots or uneven sections where branches grew so you re left with uniform wood 8 x research source knots are sections in the trunk where limbs once grew and they can cause dramatic warping as the wood dries spread paraffin wax over the ends of the boards to seal them sealing the ends of the boards will help prevent the wood from drying out too quickly which can cause splits to form in the boards melt the paraffin wax and use a paintbrush to spread a thick layer of paraffin wax over the ends of the boards so the moisture doesn t escape too quickly and the wood dries evenly 9 x research source you can find paraffin wax at your local hardware store department store or by ordering it online if you don t have paraffin wax use polyurethane shellac or latex paint to seal the ends make a bottom layer of boards in an even row start your stack by arranging an even base layer of your boards space them out so there s 6 inches 15 cm between the boards and make sure they lie flat on the ground or the floor of the kiln 10 x research source use a ruler or tape measure to make sure the boards are spaced out evenly your base layer is super important for your wood to dry consistently place stickers 16 inches 41 cm apart on top of the boards stickers are small 1 by 2 in 2 5 by 5 1 cm in boards that add space between the boards in a stack to help increase ventilation space the stickers out evenly along the top of your boards so the next layer is evenly supported 11 x research source stickers help all of the surfaces of the wood dry evenly so there isn t warping you can use any type of wood for your stickers and you can find them at your local hardware store home improvement store or by ordering them online continue stacking the boards and placing stickers place another layer of boards on top of the base layer so they rest on the stickers lay another layer of stickers on top of them and then stack another layer of boards keep laying your boards and placing stickers until all of your wood is stacked 12 x research source make sure you place your stickers 16 inches 41 cm apart for even spacing place cinderblocks on top of the stack to weigh it down lay a flat sheet of plywood over the top of your stack place cinderblocks along the rows of wood to help weigh them down and keep them from warping cracking or splitting 13 x research source the sheet of plywood will keep the cinderblocks from damaging the boards as the wood dries and the moisture evaporates the boards will start to shrink and buckle it s super important that you weigh them down to help prevent uneven drying and splitting allow the wood to dry undisturbed if you re air drying your wood outside or in a shed leave it alone to dry for about 3 4 years if you used a kiln leave it for about 2 months 14 x research source the general rule of thumb for air drying wood is to allow 1 year of drying time for every 1 inch 2 5 cm of wood use a moisture meter to test the wood for lumber to be usable it needs to have a moisture content between 5 10 a moisture meter is a device that detects the moisture content of wood place the moisture meter against the wood to get a reading 15 x research source freshly cut lumber can range from about 45 moisture content to upwards of 80 if it was recently rained on once the wood is dry enough you can keep it stacked outside or in a shed and use it whenever you need it,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to replace a tripod head,a tripod is an excellent tool for professional and amateur photographers alike eventually however you may need to replace the tripod head either because the old one is worn out or you re upgrading to a better type some people are in the dark about the process but it s actually very easy in just a few minutes you can take off your old tripod head and install a brand new one,tighten the ball locking and center column knobs you won t be able to unscrew the tripod head if any parts are loose start by turning the ball locking knob on the head clockwise to lock the head in place then turn the center column knob underneath the head clockwise as well until it stops double check to make sure the tripod head isn t moving 1 x research source if your tripod or head have any more moving parts lock them as well any loose parts might make it harder to remove the head hold the tripod by its center column with one hand use your non dominant hand grab the tripod center column and hold it firmly 2 x research source some tripods don t have a center column if yours doesn t then grab it by one of the legs and hold it tightly turn the tripod head counterclockwise to loosen it with your other hand grab the tripod head turn it counterclockwise to unscrew it you may need to apply some pressure to get it started since most people don t replace the heads very often 3 x research source if the tripod head doesn t seem to be loosening then some of the locking knobs might not be tight enough try double checking those and making sure they re all locked in place pull the old head off when it unscrews after just a few turns the tripod head should pop off of the main body lift it off and put it aside 4 x research source hold on to the head as you re unscrewing it if it comes loose unexpectedly you could drop it and break it assemble the new head if you have to some new tripod heads might come disassembled in this case follow the instructions provided to assemble the head correctly before you install it 5 x research source commonly the camera mount isn t installed on new heads simply loosen the knob next to the camera platform and slide the mount into position then tighten the knob to lock it in place lock your tripod at a comfortable height you don t want your tripod falling while you re installing the new head so make sure it s locked set it to the height you want it at then turn the center column knob clockwise to lock it in place 6 x research source tighten the pan knob on the new head just like with removing the old head all the parts on the new head need to be locked or it won t screw on properly turn the pan knob clockwise until it stops to lock the head in place 7 x research source if there are any other adjustment knobs on the new head tighten them as well align the mounting screw on the tripod with the hole on the new head most tripods have a mounting screw coming up from the center column that the head attaches to hold the new head straight up and line the hole on the bottom up with this mounting screw 8 x research source make sure you keep the new head pointed directly up so it doesn t screw on crooked less commonly some tripod heads have a screw coming out that goes into a slot on the tripod in this case you would insert the screw and tighten the tripod knob to lock the head in place 9 x research source turn the head clockwise until it s tight press the head onto the mounting screw and turn it to the right continue turning until you can t tighten it anymore to lock it in place 10 x research source check under the head to make sure there s no space between the head and tripod mount the 2 parts should fit snugly together if there s any space unscrew the head and reattach it test the new head by moving it around confirm that the new head is attached with a quick test loosen the pan knob and move the head around the head should not unscrew or loosen while you move it around check to make sure it stays snug 11 x research source if you have any problems unscrew the head and try again make sure it stays completely upright as you re screwing it into position if it s crooked then it won t attach properly,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to dry resin art,resin is a fun and versatile medium you can use to create all kinds of art from jewelry to sculpture to unique pieces of furniture depending on the kind of resin you re using getting it to dry or cure correctly can be a bit of a challenge there are several different kinds of resin on the market so you ll need to follow the curing instructions for your specific product to get the best results,use uv resin to create small objects or work in thin layers uv resin is a specialized form of epoxy resin that cures within minutes under a uv lamp choose this type of resin if you d like to make small objects like charms or pendants and want to cure them quickly 1 x research source you can make larger objects with uv resin but you ll need to work in very thin layers to achieve an even cure 2 x research source for instance if you want to seal a large object with a layer of uv resin you can apply a thin layer with a brush then cure it under a uv light for a project like this you may need to use a large lamp or a handheld uv flashlight that you can move around over the surface of the project select a uv lamp or flashlight with an output of at least 4 watts look for a uv light source that s strong enough to cure the type of resin you re using 4 watts is typically enough but check the directions on your resin product for any specific uv light strength or wavelength requirements in most cases uv lamps are stronger and will cure your piece faster than uv flashlights 3 x research source some uv lamps come in the form of a hood or dome that you can place over the object you need to cure if you re using this kind of lamp make sure it s big enough to completely cover the object you re trying to cure add a thin layer of resin to your object and cure it with the uv lamp after you ve applied a very thin layer of uv resin to your mold or over the surface of your work put the object under a uv lamp or flashlight aim to make the first layer about 1 millimetres 0 0039 in thick hold the light source close to the resin within around 1 inch 2 5 cm be careful not to touch the surface of the resin with the light 4 x research source test the resin with a toothpick every 2 3 seconds to see how hard it is depending on the size of the object it might take around 2 minutes for each layer to cure add new layers and cure them until you reach the desired thickness keep adding layers to your piece and curing them under the lamp once your object is as thick as you want it to be you can remove it from the mold you re all done 5 x research source take care handling the object while it s curing because of the chemical reactions taking place in the resin it can become very hot put your resin object in the sun if you don t have a uv lamp if you don t want to bother with a uv lamp you can simply set your resin object outside in the sun to cure however be aware that this could take longer or be less effective if you live in an area with a low uv index or the weather is overcast 6 x research source humidity can also prevent your resin from curing properly 7 x research source if you want to sun cure your uv resin choose a time when the weather will be sunny and dry look for a fast curing resin to dry your work faster not all epoxy resins are created equal if you want your art to cure quickly look for an epoxy that s labeled fast cure or quick cure 8 x research source slow curing epoxy resin can have certain advantages depending on your needs for example it tends to be stronger and more water resistant than fast curing resin it also gives you more time to work with the resin while it s still soft 9 x research source pre warm your resin and hardener in a hot water bath for faster curing warming up your epoxy and hardening agent before you start using it will help it set and cure a little more quickly fill a sink or bucket with hot water from your tap then let the bottles of resin and hardener soak in the hot water for 5 10 minutes before you start using them 10 x research source the water shouldn t be boiling hot hot tap water will work fine for this purpose don t heat just 1 component and not the other your resin won t cure properly if the elements aren t the same temperature mix the resin and hardener according to the package directions epoxy resin comes with 2 components the resin and a hardening agent read the instructions that come with your resin and hardener carefully and measure the components out precisely before you mix them together if you measure them in the wrong proportions your resin won t harden correctly 11 x research source for small amounts of epoxy resin you can measure out your components using medicine cups with ml markers if you re mixing up larger batches it may work better to weigh out your ingredients on a scale use a wooden stick to thoroughly mix the components together thorough mixing will help ensure that the resin cures evenly 12 x research source work slowly and gently to keep bubbles from forming use the recommended hardener that comes with your epoxy resin mixing and matching different products can affect how your resin cures avoid mixing in too much dye or pigment adding in other components can change the properties of your epoxy resin while it s okay to add a little liquid or powder pigment to give your resin a hint of color take care not to go overboard if more than about 7 of your mixture is pigment the resin might not cure properly 13 x research source experiment with adding just a few drops of your pigment of choice to see if you can get the result you want you can buy liquid pigments that are formulated to work with epoxy resins or mix in some colored mica powder keep the temperature in your workspace around 70 80 f 21 27 c epoxy resin is very sensitive to heat in cool conditions it will take much longer to dry or many never cure properly at all keep your project in a warm temperature controlled area to help it dry faster 14 x research source while the ideal temperature may vary depending on the product 70 80 f 21 27 c is typically a good temperature range for working with and curing epoxy resin 15 x research source check the packaging of your product for specific temperature guidelines if you don t want to heat your entire workspace you can use heat lamps or a space heater to raise the temperature immediately around your project apply more heat with a heat gun or blow dryer for extra fast drying you can speed up curing a little bit by applying direct heat use a tool such as a craft heat gun to carefully warm the surface of your project keep moving the heating tool to apply the heat evenly 16 x research source using too much direct heat can cause your resin to bubble or crack so watch closely and move the heat away immediately if you notice this starting to happen wait the recommended amount of time for your resin to cure while you can speed up the curing time of epoxy resin a bit it generally takes up to 72 hours for this kind of resin to cure completely 17 x research source check the guidelines on the packaging to get a sense of how long it should take the curing time will also depend on the size of your project resist the urge to handle your project before the recommended curing time is over touching or handling the resin before it s fully cured could cause smudging or bumps on the surface of your art adjust the amount of hardener to help your resin cure faster unlike epoxy resin you can adjust the curing time of polyester resin by changing the amount of hardener you incorporate into the mix 18 x research source check the instructions that come with your product to figure out which proportions of each product you should use to achieve your desired curing time make sure to use a hardener that s intended for use with polyester resin this kind of hardener is called mekp if you use hardener intended for epoxy or some other kind of resin it won t cure properly slow down curing by adding an inhibitor if you want your polyester resin to dry more slowly you can add an inhibitor to the mix this can be an advantage if you re doing a complicated project and want extra time to work with the resin while it s still soft 19 x research source a small amount of inhibitor goes a long way so check the instructions carefully to determine how much you should add let each layer gel but not completely harden before adding the next layer one disadvantage of polyester resin is that it shrinks when it hardens if you re working in layers in a mold let each layer cure until it reaches a slightly firm jello like consistency before adding the next layer however don t wait until it cures completely 20 x research source it takes about 15 20 minutes for polyester resin to reach the firm gel stage if you allow a layer to cure completely before adding the next layer the fresh resin will seep down into the mold around the shrunken first layer and give your piece an uneven appearance put your piece in a warm place to speed up curing much like epoxy resin polyester resin cures faster in a warm environment try turning up the heat in your workspace by a few degrees or setting some heat lamps or a space heater near the resin piece as it cures the higher the temperature in the room the faster your resin will harden 21 x research source to ensure your resin doesn t harden too quickly while you re working try to work in a space that s around 65 70 f 18 21 c you can increase the temperature or move the piece to a warmer space when you re done since both room temperature and the amount of hardening agent will affect how fast your resin cures you ll need to factor in both of these variables when planning your piece for example if the instructions call for 4 5 drops of hardener per 1 fluid ounce 30 ml of resin at a room temperature of 70 75 f 21 24 c decrease the amount of hardener you use by 1 drop if the room is any warmer than that wait 24 hours to several days for the resin to cure completely the amount of time it takes polyester resin to cure completely is highly variable depending on the size of the piece how much hardening agent or catalyst you used and how warm your workspace is it could take anywhere from a few hours to several days for your piece to cure completely 22 x research source look at the package directions and wait the recommended amount of time before handling your art smaller pieces like jewelry elements may cure in as little as 1 hour 23 x research source in general you can safely handle your art once it reaches the click hard stage i e it clicks when you tap it and is no longer sticky choose polyurethane if you want your art to cure quickly polyurethane resin cures fast and it will often be ready to take out of the mold in only 20 30 minutes 24 x research source pick this kind of resin if you re making relatively simple pieces that you don t need a lot of time to complete for example this might be a good option if you re making some simple charms or pendants mix the resin components carefully according to the instructions like most forms of craft resin polyurethane resins typically come with 2 components the resin and the catalyst or hardening agent the amounts of each component that you need to use can vary a lot depending on the product so read the instructions closely before you start mixing otherwise your resin won t cure correctly 25 x research source for example some polyurethane resins require you to make a 1 1 mixture of resin and catalyst while in other cases you only have to add a few drops of hardening agent to the resin mix your components thoroughly to ensure even curing check the instructions on your resin to see if it needs heat to cure polyurethane resin comes in cold curing and hot curing forms and some of these resins can even be cured under a uv lamp 26 x research source check the instructions on the package to find out the curing requirements for your particular project if your resin needs heat to cure you may need to turn up the heat in your workspace or warm your project with a heat lamp check the instructions with your product to determine the best temperature range for curing typically cold cure polyurethane resin can cure at room temperature you don t need to chill it or reduce the temperature in the room just leave it alone to dry on its own work in a dry environment to promote better curing polyurethane resin is extremely moisture sensitive so you ll need to avoid any humidity while you re working with it make sure your workspace is dry and humidity controlled and that there s no moisture in any molds you re using 27 x research source don t leave your polyurethane resin outside to cure unless you know conditions will be dry keep it out of direct sunlight since this kind of resin is also uv sensitive unless it has the right additives mixed in if you want to add color to your piece make sure you choose a pigment that s compatible with polyurethane resin some liquid pigments might affect how it cures allow your resin to dry for the recommended time in most cases polyurethane resin just needs to sit for a while in a dry environment to cure check the directions on the package for any other specific conditions your product might need to cure properly 28 x research source the amount of time it takes to cure will depend on your specific product and how large the project is avoid touching your resin while it s still soft or sticky to avoid damaging the surface,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to take the flash off a polaroid camera,using a polaroid camera and printing off photos in the moment has a special kind of joy and magic associated with it but of course with just one shot to get the photo right there s also a bit of pressure most polaroid pictures need the flash to come out clear and detailed but if you re out in bright sunlight it could make your subject look washed out in that case you may need to override or even cover the flash,turn the camera on with the power switch button or by flipping up the flashbar to engage or disengage the flash function your camera has to be on first most models have a power button located on the front or top of the camera the polaroid snap and some other models turn on when you flip up the flashbar which contains the lens 1 x research source if you re unsure of how to turn on your particular polaroid search online for a user s manual for a diagram of the buttons and functions locate and push down on the flash override button each model is slightly different but you should be able to find this button pretty easily look for the button that shows a lightning bolt with a strike going through it it s usually located next to the flash button or light it may be on the front or the back of your camera 2 x research source polaroids often need a lot of light to turn out well so the cameras are set to automatically use the flash function no matter what the flash button is sometimes just an led light that lights up when the camera is turned on to let you know the flash is ready to go push the shutter button while still holding the flash override button to disengage the flash hold the override button as you take the picture this can be a little tricky if you ve never done it before and sometimes your fingers can get in the way of the lens so take a moment to double check that your hands are out of the way before your snap your photo 3 x research source once you take the photo you can release the override button access the menu on a polaroid snap to turn the flash on or off the polaroid snap is a lot smaller than other models and doesn t have the same buttons or functions on the exterior of the camera turn the camera on and access the menu scroll to the settings option select the flash and tap through the options until a line appears through the lightning bolt 4 x research source remember to turn the flash back on once you re done taking the photo change the lighting by using the lighten darken switch rather than the flash the flash is usually pretty essential to taking great photos with clarity but sometimes you want to make images appear darker or lighter some models of polaroid have a lighten darken switch that can create a brighter or darker photo 5 x research source in dim lighting switch it to the lighten position if it s super bright out switch it to the darken position polaroids polaroid originals and the i 1 cameras have these switches cover the flash with clear tape or tissue paper to reduce its intensity if you need the flash because you re taking a photo indoors but don t like how washed out you end up looking you can diffuse the intensity of the flash by covering it with something light and semi translucent 6 x research source play around with using 1 2 or 3 pieces of tissue paper or tape for different results stand about 2 feet 610 mm away from the subject to take a clear photo if you re too close or too far away the camera lens will focus on either the background or the foreground especially if one of them is a lot darker than the other get in a close range to reduce blurriness 7 x research source this means that selfies are usually out of the question if you re using a polaroid you could use the self timer and set up the camera and position yourself a few feet away from it though to get a self portrait being too close to someone or something can produce a blurry photo sometimes that effect can look cool though if you re new to polaroids try playing around with different techniques to discover what works for you keep the sunlight or main light behind you or off to the side shooting straight into the light will result in a photo with a lot of contrast and you might not be able to see any details of the thing or person you re shooting the best rule of thumb is to stand so you re facing away from the light 8 x research source this is called backlighting crop your photos before you take them to get rid of unwanted visuals with a polaroid you don t have the option to digitally crop and alter images after the fact if you re taking a picture and don t want strangers in the background wait until they re out of the way or reposition your subject so they re not in frame 9 x research source when taking a photo step back for a moment and look at the entire screen to make sure it looks how you want the polaroid snap has the option to take digital photos that you can upload to your computer and then edit but most models print a photo automatically meaning you can t crop the edges hold the camera as still as possible until the photo is finished printing pretend that you re a statue moving around before the picture has fully printed could result in a blurry photograph 10 x research source try holding the camera in the palm of your left hand for extra stability protect your photo from light for 5 15 minutes so it develops fully black and white photos need about 5 10 minutes while color photos should have about 10 15 minutes keep your photo face down or in a pocket 11 x research source you might be tempted to shake the film to help the photo develop but that s a myth leave it alone and move it as little as possible to help your picture come out perfectly 12 x research source keep your camera and photos close to your body in cold weather temperatures lower than 55 f 13 c can make your camera and film produce photos that aren t as colorful or detailed as they could be to prevent this keep your camera warm by carrying it close to your body inside your coat would be great and keep printed photos close to your body too 13 x research source it can be hard to keep pictures close to your body without bending them but do your best gently slide them into a coat pocket if you plan ahead wear a shirt with a big front pocket so you can keep them in there,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tie laces in a double knot,a double knot is a great way to keep your shoelaces tied so you don t have to worry about them coming undone and potentially tripping on them you can also use a double knot when your shoelaces are too long to keep them from dragging or getting caught on something accidentally to tie your laces in a double knot start with a standard shoelace bow knot note that it will be difficult to make a double knot if your laces are very short after you tie them in a regular shoelace bow,tie your shoelaces in a standard bow knot make a loop with 1 end of the laces by doubling it back over itself wrap the other end of the laces around the base of the loop you made then push it through the hole you just made by wrapping it and pull it into another loop pull both the loops in opposite directions to tighten the bow knot 1 x research source for the best results when tying a double knot make sure the loops and laces are even on both sides of your bow knot use this method if you re having problems with your laces coming undone all the time or if they re too long and you want to keep the excess length out of the way pass the left loop over top of the right loop and wrap it around the back pinch the right loop between the thumb and forefinger of your right hand grab the left loop with the thumb and forefinger of your left hand then wrap it on top of and around the back of the right loop 2 x research source this is basically the same thing you did when you created the second loop for your standard bow knot except this time you re doing it with the loop you already made put the tip of the left loop through the hole created between the loops slip the left loop into the little hole that you made by wrapping it over and around the right loop push the tip of the loop through the hole until you can grab it from the other side 3 x research source when you pull the left loop through the hole you will be pulling it towards the right pull the loops in opposite directions to tighten the double knot grab the left loop which is now going to the right with your right hand and the right loop which is now going to the left with your left hand pull them firmly until the knot is tight 4 x research source to untie this standard double knot just work your fingertips in between the knotted loops to loosen them up and pull them apart after that you can untie the standard bow knot as normal by pulling on the straight loose ends of the laces make an overhand knot like you would to start a standard bow knot wrap the right lace over and under the left lace or vice versa this is exactly the same as the first step of tying your laces into a normal bow knot 5 x research source use this method if you want a double knot that you can untie quickly by pulling on the laces instead of picking at them to loosen them loop 1 end of the lace over the other end again in another overhand knot wrap the right lace over the left lace again or the left lace over the right lace again depending on which way you wrapped them to start with this is exactly the same as making the first overhand knot 6 x research source your laces will now look like a simple overhand knot with 3 loops in it instead of the normal 2 loops make 2 bow loops just as if you re tying a normal bow in your laces pinch the right end of the lace into a loop and wrap the left lace around it push the left lace though the space between the laces that you created by wrapping it then pull it unto a second loop 7 x research source this is exactly the same process as when you tie a standard bow knot wrap the left loop around the right loop and pull it through the hole it creates pass the left loop over the right loop and pull it around the back push it through the space between the 2 loops and pull it through to make a double knot 8 x research source this is the same as tying a standard double knot the thing that makes it quick release is the additional overhand knot at the beginning tighten the easy release double knot by pulling on both loops grab the loops 1 in each hand and pull them in opposite directions stop pulling when the knot is all the way tight 9 x research source to untie this quick release double knot just pull firmly on one of the loose straight ends of the laces,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tie a rope on a pole,when you want to tie a rope to a pole the best way to do so is by using a type of hitch knot for a quick temporary knot use a clove hitch if you want something more secure that won t slip go with the rolling hitch both of these knots are fast and easy to learn so add them both to your knot repertoire and you ll be ready to tie a rope onto a pole in a variety of situations such as when you re mooring a boat on a railing or tying a horse to a post if you don t have a pole handy you can also use these hitch knots to fasten a rope to something similar like a sturdy tree branch,wrap 1 end of your rope around the pole and under the standing end straighten out your rope and grab 1 end loop it around the pole so that it passes under the long end of the rope 1 x research source the standing end is the remaining long length of rope or the part that you aren t using to tie the knot only use the clove hitch to temporarily tie something to a pole because it has the potential to slip or bind on itself under strain for example a clove hitch can work if you just want to quickly tie a boat up to a railing to hand something off to someone but don t need to secure the boat all the way in order to leave it there pass the end of the rope over the standing end and around the pole again cross the end of the rope up and over the standing end where it is resting on the pole loop it around the pole a second time without passing it under the standing end of the rope this time 2 x research source you should just have a simple loop around the pole at this point with the rope crossed over itself diagonally in the middle if you re tying the rope to a vertical pole the end of the rope will cross over the standing end towards the top if you re tying the rope to a horizontal pole the end of the rope will cross over the standing end to the left side slide the end of the rope under itself parallel to the standing end slip the tip of the rope under the diagonal section of itself that passes over the lead end pull it through so that it is parallel to the standing end and the ends of the rope are going in opposite directions 3 x research source the knot will now look like 2 loops of rope around the pole with a diagonal section of rope crossed over top of them pull the ends of the rope tight to finish tying the clove hitch knot grab the short end of the rope in 1 hand and the long end in the other pull the ends in opposite directions to tighten the knot all the way 4 x research source the clove hitch knot is the same as using 2 half hitches put 1 end of the rope around the pole and cross it over the standing end grab your rope and loop the end of it once around the pole passing it underneath the long standing end of the rope cross the end up and over top of the standing end after you loop it around the pole and underneath 5 x research source avoid using the rolling hitch with slippery ropes made out of polyethylene and polypropylene it can slip and come undone if you tie it with these types of rope wrap the end of the rope around the pole and the standing end again continue passing the end of rope around the pole after you cross it up and over the standing end do not pass it underneath the standing end this time 6 x research source your knot should look like 1 loop around the pole with 2 diagonal sections of rope crossed over top of it at this point the end of the rope will cross over the standing end towards the top if you re tying the rope onto a vertical pole if you re tying the rope onto a horizontal pole the end of the rope will cross over the standing end towards the left loop the end of the rope around the pole a third time above the standing end wrap the end of the rope around the pole parallel to the standing end of the rope do not cross the end of the rope over the standing line this time 7 x research source now the knot will look like 2 straight loops around the pole and 2 diagonal sections of rope around the pole the ends of the rope will be facing in opposite directions the end of the rope will be on top of the standing end towards the top of the pole if you re attaching the rope to a vertical pole the end of the rope will be next to the standing end on the left side if you re putting the rope on a horizontal pole slip the tip of the rope through the second wrap you made and pull it tight slide the end of the rope under the closest diagonal section of rope and pull it through on top of the next diagonal section of rope pull both ends of the rope in opposite directions to tighten the knot and secure it in place 8 x research source as long as you don t tie a rolling hitch with slippery rope it won t slip or bind at all this means you can both tie and untie it when there is a load on it you can tie 2 rolling hitches for extra security when there is a load on your rope,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to store nambe,nambé is the brand name for an 8 metal alloy with a silver luster that s used for a range of food service and household display items nambé pieces made of the classic alloy come in a range of shapes and sizes from simple bowls you can use to serve pretzels to ornate pieces of art no matter the piece nambé can be used displayed and stored for years and still look great so long as you follow the recommended cleaning polishing and food service procedures,show off your nambé in a high visibility spot like a mantel or table items made from the classic nambé 8 metal alloy can get a bit pricey but they don t need to be hidden away in some display cabinet most pieces are sturdy enough to be held and used regularly so feel free to give your nambé a prominent and accessible spot 1 x research source the nambé alloy does not scratch or dent easily so go ahead and let visitors admire your collection up close when people hear nambé they usually think of the 8 metal alloy that said the company that makes nambé has branched out in recent years and now produces a range of products that aren t made of the classic silver toned alloy the storage and care instructions for these product lines may vary so check out https www nambe com static care and use html display your item out of direct sunlight as an extra precaution under normal conditions classic nambé pieces can be displayed inside the home for years or even decades with minimal signs of aging while not specifically advised for the classic metal alloy pieces keeping your displayed nambé item out of direct sunlight may further prolong its beauty 2 x research source the nambé company s line of crystal items however should specifically not be displayed in direct sunlight for any extended period of time don t store food or flowers in classic nambé except vases nambé pieces are made for food service not food storage food items should not be kept in a classic nambé piece for more than 3 hours if you want to display flowers use only a nambé piece that s specifically designed to be filled with water and used as a vase 3 x research source classic nambé vases have unpolished interiors that can stand up to being exposed to standing water if left in place too long foods liquids and or organic materials like flowers can cause discoloration that may be difficult to remove pack the item in its original box for long term storage if possible while many nambé owners want their pieces to be prominently displayed at all times you may at some point want to pack away an item for secure storage or transport in this case the item s original box including the packing material inside is the ideal storage vessel keep the original packaging in a handy location so you can use it again as needed 4 x research source if you don t have the original packaging wrap the item in a soft cloth then in bubble wrap and nestle it into a sturdy cardboard box of appropriate size the original packaging is more than sufficient to protect the item during shipping if you want to make sure the item s original box remains in pristine shape though pack it inside a slightly larger shipping box lined with cushioning material get rid of dust by wiping gently with a dry soft cloth use your softest hand towel buy a polishing cloth grab a feather duster or use one of the cleaning pads from a dry dusting floor cleaner such as swiffer a few quick wipes should take care of any accumulated dust 5 x research source depending on where you keep it and how you use it your nambé item may need a quick dusting every few weeks or so avoid using dusting sprays or wipes on your nambé items simpler is better when it comes to removing dust from a classic nambé piece dusting sprays and wipes may just leave a film on the item that dulls its lustrous finish dry dusting is more than sufficient for items that just sit on the shelf 6 x research source sprays and wipes likely won t damage the finish they re just unnecessary remove smudges with a bit of glass cleaner on a soft cloth dust the item first if needed then very lightly dampen a clean cloth with a spray or two of glass cleaner use a gentle circular motion to wipe away any visible smudges or fingerprints on the item 7 x research source don t over dampen the cloth you should see little if any surface moisture on the nambé item as you wipe it wipe a thin coat of vegetable oil on all food contact surfaces apply the oil with a clean soft cloth wiping it on gently you only need to add a thin even coat of oil to those areas of the item that will be in contact with food such as the inside of a bowl 8 x research source vegetable oil helps to protect the finish from staining due to food contact definitely don t skip this step if you re serving an acidic food item such as a salad dressed with a vinaigrette chill the item in the freezer or warm it in the oven if desired the classic nambé alloy retains both heat and cold exceptionally well which means it helps keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold during service give it an extra boost by warming or chilling your nambé piece before service 9 x research source to keep food chilled put the nambé piece in the freezer for around 30 minutes after adding the vegetable oil but before adding the food to it to keep food warm place the nambé piece in an oven set at about 350 f 177 c for 10 15 minutes once again after adding the oil but before adding the food classic nambé can handle oven temperatures of up to 500 f 260 c but the oil may smoke and scorch at this high temperature never heat classic nambé on the stovetop or in the microwave use only wood or silicone utensils to serve the food hard plastic utensils may be acceptable if they don t have any sharp edges but metal utensils should always be avoided the risk of scratching the finish on your nambé item is simply too great 10 x research source don t stab food items with a serving fork to lift them out of the serving dish even if it doesn t have sharp tines instead use serving tongs with wood or soft silicone tips remove served food from your nambé item within 3 hours even with the vegetable oil barrier acidic food items in particular may start to stain the surface of your piece after around 3 hours for the best results remove any food from your nambé as soon as is convenient 11 x research source dry low acid items such as pretzels are unlikely to cause any staining but it s better to be safe than sorry treat the 3 hour limit as an absolute maximum for high acid items like citrus wedges and tomato based sauces wash off food residue asap with a damp soft cloth and mild soap many nambé pieces function as elegant food service dishes but make sure to always wash your pieces quickly and gently as soon as convenient after using an item dip a clean cloth into a mixture of lukewarm water and a mild dish soap wipe away all food residue from the item using only as much wiping pressure as is necessary rinse the item quickly under cool running water 12 x research source if some of the food residue is stuck on soak the item in the soapy water for no more than 5 10 minutes don t submerge classic nambé pieces in water for longer than this or the finish may get dull or discolored definitely do not put your nambé pieces in the dishwasher dry a washed item immediately and completely with a soft cloth drying the item quickly and gently is just as important as washing it use a soft clean dry cloth to pat and gently wipe the item keep working until the piece is absolutely dry with no evidence of surface moisture 13 x research source do not leave a damp item to air dry always dry classic nambé pieces carefully by hand if your item has a lid make sure all the parts are 100 dry before putting the lid back on clean and dry the item completely and carefully if the piece is just dusty wipe it gently with a clean soft cloth or a feather duster otherwise wash it as needed 14 x research source remove smudges and fingerprints by slightly wetting a clean soft cloth with glass cleaner and gently wiping the item clean off food residue with lukewarm water a gentle dish soap and a clean soft cloth don t submerge or soak the item in water dry it completely with another clean soft cloth squeeze a small amount of nambé polish on a clean soft cloth nambé recommends that you use only its proprietary polish which is available in 2 oz 57 g tubes wherever nambé products are sold a little bit of this polish goes a long way so start by squeezing at most a pea sized amount onto the cloth you can always add more polish if needed 15 x research source the polishing kit sold online and in stores includes 1 tube of nambé polish 1 polishing cloth and 2 pairs of latex gloves wearing gloves is recommended but not absolutely necessary while you work you ll need at least 1 more soft clean cloth to complete the job you can try an alternative metal polish if you wish but most nambé enthusiasts tend to stick with the proprietary polish rub on the polish gently with a back and forth motion focus your polishing efforts on any nicks or scratches in your piece gently press the cloth over the scratch or nick and rub back and forth across it as if you re trying to fill it in with the polish slightly expand the size of your back and forth motion with each pass 16 x research source it s not necessary to apply the polish evenly over the item s entire surface it won t hurt the piece to do so but you ll use up the pricey nambé polish much more quickly keep rubbing gently until a black residue appears you might be a bit alarmed at first when you see the black residue which is actually a tiny amount of the nambé finish being rubbed off but relax this is what you want to see the black residue often appears after only a few seconds of applying the polish 17 x research source apply a bit more polish to your cloth if you don t see the black residue after around 15 30 seconds of rubbing buff away the residue gently with a new soft cloth grab a fresh cloth and rub the area you just polished with a gentle circular motion keep buffing in small circles as you work out away from the treated area until you ve covered the entire item 18 x research source adjust to a clean section of the cloth every so often as residue appears on it try polishing stubborn scratches with extra fine 0000 steel wool if a scratch or nick hasn t disappeared after 1 application of polish you can try repeating the process as before alternatively follow the same procedure but use extra fine 0000 steel wool instead of a cloth to apply the polish buff the item with a clean cloth as before 19 x research source be warned that using steel wool even of an extra fine grade is a risk reward proposition you might make a troublesome scratch disappear but rubbing too hard may create additional scratches for a deep scratch or nick consider contacting nambé directly for potential repair options wash off the polish with a gentle soap and dry the item fully wet a clean soft cloth in a mixture of lukewarm water and a gentle dish soap wipe the entire item carefully making sure to remove all the excess polish rinse the item quickly under cool running water then gently but completely pat and wipe it dry with another soft clean cloth 20 x research source it s especially important to remove all the excess polish if you use the item for food service,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to paint a ceiling with a sprayer,using a sprayer is a fast and efficient way to paint they re popular with professionals who have to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time so a sprayer may be the best choice if you want to get a job done fast painting a ceiling with a sprayer isn t much different from painting walls you still have to prep the area clean out the sprayer and work in broad even strokes with the right prep work and technique you should finish painting your ceiling in no time,cover the floors and furniture with a plastic drop cloth painting with a sprayer can be messy so make sure all your floors and furniture are covered spread a drop cloth around the entire room before getting started use a plastic sheet instead of cloth so paint spills won t soak through 1 x research source try to remove as much furniture as you can before starting this way you won t have to work around any obstructions while you re painting tape plastic sheets to cover the walls a paint sprayer could splash paint around if you aren t careful so protect your walls take plastic sheets long enough to cover your walls from floor to ceiling line each sheet up with the top edge where the wall meets the ceiling and tape it in place work around the whole room until all the walls are covered 2 x research source cut holes in the plastic around any windows so you can ventilate the room use plastic instead of cloth sheets the paint can soak through cloth if you re also planning on painting the walls then you don t have to worry so much about covering them you can paint over any splashes or imperfections when you re paint the walls open all the windows in the room painting with a sprayer sends a lot more fumes into the air than using a brush or roller ventilate the room by opening all the windows and keeping them open while you work for extra protection use a window fan to pull fumes outside 3 x research source paint sprayers aren t designed for use in enclosed spaces without windows if the room you re working in doesn t have any windows then use a roller to paint the ceiling instead otherwise you could inhale harmful paint fumes sand the ceiling if it s been painted before a light sanding helps the paint stick better and gives you an even coat attach 120 grit sandpaper to a pole sander then apply moderate pressure and sweep the sander across the ceiling continue sanding until you cover the whole ceiling 4 x research source you ll probably have to change the paper a few times when it feels like the sander isn t gripping the ceiling as well then the paper is clogged and needs changing if you don t have a pole sander you could use regular sandpaper while standing on a latter be very careful and maintain your balance and don t stand on the highest step wash the ceiling with warm water and dish soap any dust or dirt on the ceiling will give you an uneven coat and could stop the paint from sticking correctly fill a bucket with warm water and a few drops of dish soap dip in a clean mop and wring it out so it s only damp then wipe down the ceiling 5 x research source let the ceiling dry completely before painting you could also use a sponge but you ll have to stand on a ladder to reach the ceiling strain the paint you can use standard paint in a sprayer but it won t spray well if it s too thick set up a paint strainer bag in an empty bucket then pour the paint into the strainer let it sit and run through the strainer remove the strainer and use the thinned paint in the bucket 6 x research source if there is still some paint left in the strainer pick it up and run your hand down the strainer to work out the remaining paint put a rubber glove on first dip the suction hose into the bucket of paint the suction hose pulls paint into the sprayer take this piece and insert it into the bucket of strained paint 7 x research source if you aren t sure which part the suction hose is check your user manual it usually looks like a small shower head set the spray to prime look on the side of the sprayer for a knob that switches between prime and paint set the knob to prime this is the setting to clear the sprayer out before painting 8 x research source even if the sprayer is new you should still prime it to get started this prevents any bubbles or dirt from coming out when you re trying to paint put the painting tube into an empty bucket the priming process forces any old paint or water out of the sprayer before you paint any empty bucket will do set the sprayer tube into the bucket and hold it there so it doesn t fall out 9 x research source newer paint sprayers are airless so you don t have to connect them to an air source older sprayers might still need a compressed air attachment to work so you ll have to connect this before priming prime the sprayer until fresh paint comes out of the tube hit the on switch to start priming the sprayer water and old paint will start coming out of the tube keep the sprayer running until new paint free of bubbles starts coming out then turn the sprayer off 10 x research source if you ve never used the sprayer before then there probably isn t any water in the system in this case a quick priming to get started is all you need run the sprayer on paint when you re done priming turn the knob back to the paint setting put the painting tube back into the empty bucket and turn the sprayer on run the sprayer for a few seconds until there are no bubbles coming out of the tube then power the sprayer down and get ready to paint 11 x research source sometimes the painting mode is marked spray instead of paint put on a mask and goggles before starting painting with a sprayer sends a lot of fumes into the air so take extra steps to protect yourself wear goggles that wrap around your eyes so paint can t drip around them also put on a mask with a chemical filter like a respirator so you don t breathe in any fumes 12 x research source a dust mask is better than nothing but still not good enough for painting with a sprayer attach an extension tip if you can t reach the ceiling some paint sprayers have extenders to reach high places which are ideal for ceilings if your ceiling is too high to reach with a standard tip on then attach the extender 13 x research source the process of changing tips is different for all sprayers so follow the directions in your user manual if you don t have an extender then you ll have to use a ladder to paint the ceiling be very careful and maintain your balance while you re working spray in long straight lines to cover the ceiling hold the sprayer about 6 12 in 15 30 cm from the ceiling surface then power it on and pull the trigger to begin spraying spray in a long sweeping line from one side of the ceiling to the other 14 x research source point the sprayer directly at the ceiling as much as you can for the best coverage maintain a consistent distance from the ceiling while you re spraying otherwise you won t get an even coat overlap each stroke by 50 working in a line pattern is the best way to get an even coat of paint on the ceiling when you make subsequent strokes overlap the previous one by about 50 so you get even coverage 15 x research source maintain straight smooth strokes for the best results spraying in a wavy motion like you would with a paint can will give you an uneven coat spray over the first layer in horizontal strokes to get an even coat when you ve covered the ceiling with long broad lines then work in the opposite direction spray another layer horizontally so it intersects the lines from your first pass this gives you an even coat of paint 16 x research source this step is still part of the first coat so you don t have to wait for the paint to dry some sprayers have vertical and horizontal nozzles that you can use for the same effect in this case you don t have to work in the opposite direction apply a second coat when the first one dries depending on the paint type it might take 4 8 hours for the base coat to dry when it does then apply a second coat in the same pattern and style that you used for the first one this should give you a nice even coat of paint on your ceiling 17 x research source remove the drop cloths and sheets when the paint is dry start by taking the sheets off the walls and removing the tape then pull up the drop cloths carefully roll them up gently to avoid kicking up dirt or paint then fold the cloths over so no paint drips out take them outside to air out 18 x research source if the ceiling edges aren t even because tape or plastic was in the way you could touch up the area with a brush later one,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to paint white walls,a fresh coat of white paint can really brighten up a room and make it look sharp and modern white décor can even make rooms look bigger so it s ideal for smaller apartments or bedrooms painting a wall isn t a special skill but painting walls white requires a few tricks for the best results with the right preparation priming and application the darker base color won t bleed through and your walls will look brand new,remove any furniture frames or fixtures from the room and walls move as much furniture out of the room as possible so you can paint without any obstructions if you have any removable frames pictures or decorations on the wall remove them before you get started then go around the wall and remove any light fixtures or outlet covers so they don t get in the way 1 x research source if you can t remove all of the furniture from the room make sure you cover it with a sheet to keep it clean put all of the fixtures or outlets into a bag so you don t lose any pieces keep track of all the screws you remove so you can put the fixtures back put painter s tape over electrical outlets plugs and wires so you don t get any paint in them tape a drop cloth or sheet over the floor painting is always a messy job even if you re careful cover the whole floor with a drop cloth long enough to stretch from one wall to the other tape the cloth down so no paint drips underneath it 2 x research source you might need multiple drop cloths to cover the whole floor tape off the areas that you don t want to paint even if you re a skilled painter you could still slip in some spots run painter s tape along the edge of the wall along the ceiling baseboards and any molding along the wall this protects any spots that you don t want to paint 3 x research source paint can still bleed through tape so try to avoid painting over it it s just there as a precaution open the windows to get rid of any paint fumes it s much safer to work in a well ventilated area so open all the windows in the room continue airing out the room when you re done painting so the fumes don t build up 4 x trustworthy source consumer products safety commission independent u s government agency responsible for protecting consumers by developing safety standards and conducting product research go to source if you re sensitive to paint fumes use a window fan to pull more fumes out you can also prevent fumes from getting into other rooms by taping a plastic sheet over the doorway repair any cracks or holes in the wall before painting any imperfections on the wall will show clearly under white paint so go over the wall carefully to find cracks or holes fill them in with spackle or caulk scrape away any excess filler so the repair is flat then let it dry sand the repairs down so they re smooth and don t show through the paint 5 x research source spackle could take 1 4 hours to dry depending on the type caulk can dry in as little as 30 minutes check the instructions on the product you use and give the repairs enough time to dry sand the walls lightly this helps the primer and paint stick and will make white paint look especially good use 120 grit sandpaper and lightly sand the wall along with any other surfaces that you re painting use a gentle circular motion and work your way across the wall 6 x research source pay special attention to any rough or raised spots smooth them out so they don t show through the paint always wear a dust mask while you re sanding even if the windows are open if you have textured walls then skip the sanding you could remove the texture accidentally clean the walls with warm water to remove any dirt dust and dirt can show through white paint so make sure the walls are completely clean before painting 7 x research source fill a bucket with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap dip and wring out a sponge then wash all the walls in a circular motion rinse the walls with a damp cloth afterward 8 x research source let the walls dry completely before you start painting if you re painting a textured wall it ll be tougher to clean use a vacuum with a brush attachment to get dirt out of the grooves and crevices before washing the wall with a sponge 9 x research source match the shade of white paint to the room you might think there is only one type of white but there are actually many different shades some have a slightly blue tint some are closer to cream and some lean closer to gray shop for different color choices and get a few samples to see how they look in your room pick the one that matches the décor the best 10 x research source hold the paint samples up to the wall to see if they match the existing décor and look good in the light if you can t decide on a color paint a small section of the wall and leave it there for a few days notice how the light hits that spot and how it complements the rest of the room if it looks good then pick that one you could also ask a designer at the hardware store for suggestions on the best shade choose a gloss or semi gloss paint so the walls are easier to clean white paint is more vulnerable to stains and hand prints so you ll probably have to work a bit harder to keep the walls clean gloss or semi gloss paints are easier to clean and wash so these are the best paint choices for white walls 11 x research source gloss paints can show any imperfections like cracks or holes more clearly so be sure you ve repaired and sanded the surface before painting apply white stain blocking primer so the base color won t bleed through stain blocking primer is ideal for white paint because it absorbs base colors and prevents them from bleeding through the best way to apply primer is with a roller pour the primer into a paint tray and dip the roller in wipe off any excess on the side of the tray then roll a primer onto wall sections roughly 3 ft 0 91 m by 3 ft 0 91 m re wetting the roller as you need to work across the wall until you ve covered it all 12 x research source if you have to paint corners or edges brush the primer on with a regular paintbrush primers come in a few different colors but use a white one since you re using white paint apply an extra coat of primer if you re painting over a dark color in most cases one coat or primer is enough however if the base color was dark like brown black or red then use a second coat of primer to be safe wait 3 4 hours for the first coat to dry then apply another this should block the base color from showing through the new paint then wait another 3 4 hours for the second coat to dry 13 x research source if you have any doubts about whether or not you need a second primer coat then apply a second coat you don t want to finish painting only to realize the base color is bleeding through sand the wall again after the primer dries this helps the paint stick even better and should give you a more even coat after the primer dries lightly sand the entire wall again with 120 grit sandpaper 14 x research source brush the paint around corners and along edges this is called cutting in and it helps you avoid getting paint where you don t want it dip your brush into the paint and wipe off any excess then brush a line of paint 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm thick along the tape that you put down continue until you ve filled in the edges of the wall 15 x research source also brush 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm on either side of each corner since you won t be able to reach into there with a roller roll a thick coat of paint onto the wall you can apply the paint the same way that you applied the primer pour the paint into a paint tray and wet your roller wipe off any excess so the roller is just damp with paint roll the paint onto the wall in alternating m and w patterns until you cover each 3 ft 0 91 m by 3 ft 0 91 m section then move on continue in that pattern until you ve covered the whole wall 16 x research source since you re painting with white lay the paint down thick this prevent the base color from bleeding through if any drips roll over it with your roller so you don t cause any drip lines on the final coat make sure you use a clean roller or tray so you don t mix primer and paint paint usually takes 8 hours to dry but check the drying time for the specific paint that you use paint a second coat when the first one dries most walls need 2 coats for good coverage use a brush and cut in around the edges of the wall like you did before then roll on the paint in the same m and w pattern that you used for the first coat continue until you ve covered the whole surface then let the paint dry 17 x research source in most cases 2 coats are enough however if the paint dries and you can still see some of the base color then add a third let the paint cure for 24 48 hours paint needs at least a day to dry completely leave it alone and don t touch it for 24 48 hours after that time passes then you can continue with redecorating your room 18 x research source clean up when you re done painting once the paint is all dry you can clean the room pull up the drop cloth and remove all of the tape you put on the walls reinstall and fixtures or switches that you removed as well 19 x research source try to roll up and fold the drop cloth when you pick it up this way you won t spread any dust in your home then take it outside and let it air out,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to cover up graffiti,graffiti can be a real nuisance especially if your business or building gets tagged property owners deal with this kind of vandalism all the time so lots of people know what you re going through fortunately you can cover this eyesore without too much trouble there are many ways to strip or remove graffiti entirely but generally the easiest and cheapest method is simply painting over it by choosing the right paint and prepping the surface correctly you can cover graffiti entirely for a fresh start,get a stain blocking primer so the graffiti doesn t soak through stain blockers absorb older paint and prevent it from bleeding through a new coat you can find this primer type at standard hardware and paint stores 1 x research source while using the right primer is always important this is especially important if you re using a lighter color like tan to cover the graffiti light paint colors like white or baby blue probably won t cover the graffiti well if you do want to repaint the wall with a light color then you ll probably have to remove the graffiti completely first you can either power wash it off or use chemical removers to strip the paint choose a glossy enamel paint to resist future graffiti glossy paints are harder to stick to and future graffiti will wash off easier they re also more durable and are usually used on outdoor surfaces use this type of paint so if the surface gets tagged again you can wash it off instead of repainting the whole thing 2 x research source you can find enamel paint at a standard hardware or paint store this is a better choice if you re covering a large area instead of just spot treating glossy paint in one small spot won t do a lot to fight graffiti in the future spray paint doesn t work well for covering graffiti because it s tough to cover a large surface with it and the graffiti might bleed through latex or water based paint is also not as durable and won t work well for outdoor surfaces match the new paint with the old base color if it s dark if you can perfectly match the coverup paint with the base color then your job will be a lot easier dark base colors are the easiest to paint over it s best if you still have some of the old paint on hand if not try to get a matching color from the hardware store 3 x research source if you aren t sure exactly what color the base paint is get a few samples or swatches to hold up to the wall and compare do not cover the graffiti with a different color than the base color officials agree that patchwork using different colors invites more graffiti in the future 4 x research source switch to a darker paint if the current color is tan or white if the base color was very light like white or tan then covering the graffiti with the same color probably won t work the darker graffiti will bleed through the new paint even if you apply multiple coats in this case switch to a darker color like black this will cover the graffiti without any bleed through 5 x research source darker colors like brown or black are usually the easiest to color match and repaint so these are good choices if you re in a very graffiti prone area buy an extra can in case you have to cover more graffiti in the future since color matching is very important it helps to have some of the new paint you use on hand in case you need it in the future that way if the surface gets tagged again you can just cover that spot instead of repainting the whole thing 6 x research source if you don t keep extra paint around at least note the exact color and manufacturer of the paint so you can get more if you have to keep in mind that manufacturers sometimes change or discontinue color lines this is why keeping an extra can around is better than just making note of the color clean the surface with water and soap the new paint won t stick as well if there is any dirt or grease on the surface mix water and some dish soap then use a rag brush or roller to wash the surface let it dry completely before you paint 7 x research source if the surface is large and you can t reach it all a power or pressure washer might be a better choice you could also just hose down the surface this isn t as good as a full wash but it s better than nothing prime the area so the graffiti doesn t show through the new paint priming blocks the graffiti from bleeding through the new coat of paint and also helps the paint stick better brush or roll on an even coat of stain blocker primer to cover the whole surface that you ll be painting 8 x research source wait for the primer to dry completely before painting for most primers this is about 3 4 hours but check the instructions on the product that you use if you re using a very dark paint like black then you probably don t have to use a stain blocker however still prime the wall before painting cover the graffiti section if you can match the colors perfectly if you can match the new paint with the base paint then you can just paint over the graffitied section paint a square border around the graffiti then roll or brush the new paint over the graffiti apply an even smooth coat to cover it entirely 9 x research source do not do this with 2 different colors a section with different colors invites new graffiti 10 x research source if you start painting and realize that the colors don t match as well as you thought then you might have to repaint everything wait for the paint to dry and see how well the colors match before making a decision repaint the entire area if you re using a new color if you can t match the colors then it s best to repaint the whole surface instead of just covering the graffiti pour the new paint into a tray and dip a brush or roller in then cover the entire surface graffiti and all with the new paint 11 x research source for large surfaces like the side of a building you may need a professional painting service if you have to reach high areas be very careful when using a ladder don t stand on the top step and make sure the ladder is secure before climbing up apply an additional coat if the graffiti is still visible let the paint dry for 3 4 hours then check if you can still see any graffiti bleeding through if so then cover it with another coat of paint 12 x research source your paint may need additional drying time depending on the type check the instructions on the paint you use,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to put thread in an overlock machine,overlock sewing machines also known as sergers have a reputation for being difficult to thread this is mainly because overlock machines hold multiple spools of thread so you have to make sure to pass each thread through the correct threading path don t worry if you re feeling intimidated by the prospect of threading your overlock machine with a little patience and practice you can learn how to do it soon enough you ll be happily sewing away on your overlock machine,turn off and flip open the cover on your overlock machine make sure the machine s power switch is set to the off position flip the looper cover door down which is the door in the bottom right hand corner of the front of the machine to expose the threading pathway loops and hooks 1 x research source the threading pathway loops and hooks are what you have to pass the thread through to set up your machine some overlock machines have handy tools on the inside of the looper cover door that you can use to help you thread it for example you might find a pair of tweezers a screwdriver and a needle threading tool raise the machine s presser foot using its lever the presser foot is the foot shaped metal piece that holds the fabric flat while you feed it through the machine to keep your sewing on track lift this foot up by raising the lever beside it to release tension on the tension disks and make the machine easier to thread 2 x research source you can also remove the presser foot entirely to expose the threading path at the stitching plate and make it even easier to thread there is usually a button at the back of the foot that you can press to take it off turn the handwheel to set the needles in the highest position move the machine s handwheel until the red line on the wheel lines up with the arrow on the needle position window this lets you know that the machine s 2 needles are in the highest position 3 x research source some overlock machines stop with the needles automatically in the highest position if this is the case for your machine you don t have to go to the trouble of manually raising the needles place your selected thread spools on the thread stand spool holders lift up the retractable thread stand at the back of your overlock machine put a spool of thread on each one of the spool holders on the thread stand pull the end of the thread from each spool into the thread guide on the top of the thread stand 4 x research source overlock machines can hold from 3 5 thread spools depending on the make and model you don t necessarily have to fill all the thread stands but use at least 2 spools of thread it s always best to use the same type of thread on all the spools of an overlock machine so you get the same size of stitch from each thread 5 x research source if you just want to practice using your overlock machine try using a different color of thread for each spool that way you can see clearly which spool creates which part of the stitch 6 x research source slip the threads through the pre tension guides and the tension disk grooves slide the end of each thread into the corresponding pre tension guide like you re sliding dental floss between your teeth pull each thread down through the groove in front of the pre tension guide and down into the tension disk 7 x research source the pre tension guides look like little hooks or clips on top of the sewing machine right in front of each spool holder the tension disks are round knobs on the front of the machine directly opposite each spool holder on the back of the machine pull each thread through the color coded guides for that spool most overlock machines have a handy color coded diagram and colored dots that show you where each thread is supposed to pass through follow this diagram and pass each thread through the color coded hooks and loops for that spool of thread 8 x research source you can use a pair of tweezers to make it easier to pass the thread through all the holes this is especially helpful for the final holes underneath the presser foot pass the ends of the threads behind the presser foot pull the end of each thread underneath the presser foot and towards the back of the machine do this for each thread after you pass it through the final hole near the presser foot 9 x research source this will allow you to thread the needles correctly slide the threads onto the needles using a needle threading tool pass the end of the thread horizontally through the slit in the needle threading tool slide the tool down the shaft of the needle until the end of the thread is close to the eye of the needle 10 x research source there are 2 needles on an overlock machine if you re only using 2 spools of thread you might only use 1 of the needles if you re using 4 spools you will need to thread both needles the color coded diagram on your machine will show you which thread goes to which needle if you are only using 1 needle remove the other needle otherwise you can end up with an ugly stitch use the threading tool s hook to pull the thread through the eye of the needle carefully pull the threading tool away from the needle grab the end of the thread with the tool s hook and pull it through the eye of the needle to finish threading your overlock machine 11 x research source you don t have to tie the thread once it s through the eye of the needle remember to repeat this for each needle if you are using both of them set the tension disks to position 4 for a starting default tension setting make sure each tension disk for each spool of thread you re using is turned to the number 4 this is the default tension setting for most sewing purposes and a good place to start unless you already know you want to use a different tension setting 12 x research source with practice you might choose to increase the tension when you re sewing heavier materials or decrease it when you re sewing more fine materials feel free to experiment with the tension to find which tension settings give you a quality of stitch that you re happy with position your fabric under the pressure foot slide a piece of fabric that you want to sew onto the pressure plate underneath the pressure foot the pressure foot must still be raised in order for you to slide your fabric under it 13 x research source it s a good idea to practice sewing on a scrap piece of fabric first that way you can check the quality of the stitch and make adjustments to the thread or tension if you want to lower the pressure foot back down by moving its lever press the lever next to the pressure foot all the way down to lower it this will put tension on the thread and hold your fabric in place on the pressure plate 14 x research source if you don t remember to lower the pressure foot back down there won t be enough tension on the threads and you won t be able to guide your fabric well so you ll end up with a messy stitch sew and check the stitch chain to see that it is neat and uniform turn the needle hand wheel towards you 2 3 times to get the stitch started then use the foot pedal to keep sewing guide your fabric underneath the needle then look at the stitch once it s long enough to see and check for quality 15 x research source if the stitch is not uniform or is messy double check that you threaded the machine properly and set the tension disks correctly if you passed the threads through the wrong threading paths you will immediately see that you are not getting a proper chain stitch,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build several easy antennas for amateur radio,amateur radio has been a supreme way of communications for many ways of getting messages from one place to another for decades many antennas have been invented simply by necessity spark gap transmitters were used around the time of the great disaster of the titanic wireless is what they called it back then and still to this day wire antennas are sending signals out on the airways amateur radio has progressed and continually changed since the spark gap transmitters of that time high voltage coils were used for their power and it systematically sent out the familiar dits and dahs of morse code and the party or parties at the other end who could read morse code wrote the symbols down and they made words a fantastic and fascinating way of communication and yet it was primitive enough to look back on from this date and say that was one fantastic communications tool,emphasis on the antenna the heart of the system of amateur radio is the antenna there are many other misinformed persons stating that power is the ultimate force not so the heart of any radio station be it amateur radio commercial business cb personal family radio or experimenters in extremely low power amateur radio qrp as it is called transmissions is the antenna without good reception you won t hear much without good antennas for transmitting you won t transmit far even if you apply high output rf power or if high output watts are used planning an antenna project can lead to many different thoughts and you should always consider the following height length feedline balun and we will talk about a balun later insulators type wire used or type metal used what do you want to do with this antenna how many bands do you want it to perform its work if you can use the right materials space to hang one and the biggest of all downfalls if you live in a place that has zoning laws you may have to get permission gag to put up an antenna on your own property use materials that match easily antennas can be made from many different materials remember that you should use metal of similar nature as dissimilar metals have a tendency to corrode or to have a non conductive properties metals such as copper aluminum tin and steel all will conduct electricity but when we are talking about radio frequency or rf currents and voltages we are talking about skin effect electricity aluminum antenna wire is hard to work with has a very easy breaking point and oft times stretches out of shape and cannot be soldered using conventional solder aluminum wire is not expensive but it is the least desirable wire for antenna use copper house wire prices have skyrocketed in the recent months finding old house wire is the best choice diameter of 12 gauge wire is about 1 8th inch thick its not hard to work with and is probably the best antenna metal tin wire used for electric fence purposes make an excellent wire antenna and it is not to expensive the only draw back is that you have to purchase it in either 1 4 or 1 2 mile 0 4 or 0 8 km rolls if you plan on building several antennas you should have no problem with this large roll of wire what works with what current regular dc or ac current and voltages travel through the center of the wire whereas rf runs on the outer portions of the wire picture if you will a wire with the cut portion of the wire pointing at you if we could see the wire with the current on it it would be easy to define ac and dc currents would be from the center out rf though would be along the outer portions of the wire like the skin of the wire the type of metal used would have a conductivity scale of course none of us will be using any precious metals in making an antenna but the rare metals gold silver and platinum are the three most conductive metals of all but since they cost so much we have to settle for copper wire steel with either a brass or copper coating or perhaps tin with or without copper coating or plain electric fence type tin wire or possibly aluminum wire if you have no other wire to use any good conductor of electricity will conduct rf the least favored is the mechanic wire which has a high resistance and corrodes and rusts easily causing unwanted resistance and antenna failure when subjected to the weather mechanic wire will rust easily creating a never ending problem of either breakage or a problem of major non connectivity it does not radiate rf energy well and doesn t receive signals from other amateur stations transmitting to you one of the best and probably the cheapest is the electric fence wire that is coated with brass or copper since we are dealing with skin effect properties just the outer coating will bear the rf energy steel wire also should be avoided if possible steel will rust easily even if it is coated in brass or copper tin wire that is used for electric fence wire that is not coated also can be used but make sure that you inspect the connections from time to time to remove any corrosion and re solder them if necessary insulated house wire that is solid copper can make one fantastic wire antenna at least seventy 70 percent of all amateur radio antennas are made of some sort of insulated or non insulated wire those are the ones we will be talking about here in this article start by choosing your place and space for your antenna you should never be close to a power line that is energized many people have been seriously injured or have been fatally electrocuted due to their contact with high power transmission lines it takes just one touch from these high power lines to kill someone who is trying to put up an antenna look for low hanging power lines and stay away from them at least by one and a half lengths of the height of your longest pole closest to the power wires the closer you are to your radio room the better off you will be back yard antennas right close to your radio room or radio shack make it easy to set up and operate try to avoid placing any portion of your antenna close to the place where electricity enters your home use good straight wire and avoid serious bends or twists in the wire if you are using tin with copper or brass coatings watch out for the tendency to coil back onto the wire some tightly wound wire may also coil back on itself regardless of what it is made from or coatings some wires also have a tendency of having sharp ends when cut steel is the worst good sharp side cutter pliers or diagonal cutters can also leave a ridge that is sharp if using certain metals the smaller the wire the harder it is to work with also using wire of light gauge either 17 18 right through 22 or 24 gauge has many problems not the least of which is its durability wind can destroy an antenna in a few moves with small gauge wires 17 through 22 i recommend using not less than 18 gauge for most antennas there are places that we mentioned earlier that won t allow antennas towers or antenna poles to be constructed a dipole in the attic of your home is a good idea if you have enough space in your attic to place one folded dipole antennas will work great if you do not have a metal roof select the wire you want to use make sure it is a wire that can withstand the weather both summer and winter and that it is of a workable nature in other words don t use a wire that can cause problems down the road when it is actually put into use insulated copper house wire is excellent please do not remove the insulation as a matter of a fact the life of the antenna can greatly be extended if you do leave the insulation on the wire also it insulates it from a short against a green tree or tree leaf or even a weed or branch that may fall make sure that if it is bare wire that you keep it up from the ground and we will get into that also later so no unsuspecting person comes in contact with the line in the event it is energized with rf currents rf burns can hurt and burn deeply into the flesh of a finger or hand rf is a sort of invisible energy and it is the forced movements of electrons along a given path that is an ac style current many tuned circuits of today s time can actually go down to several layers of skin with just one touch it burns and sometimes actually fries your skin into a white powder this is called rf bite since it feels like you got bit by some sort of bad bug or stung by a bee that has no poison but can seriously hurt amplified rf also hurts worse due to the added power applied to the antenna if you are using a tube type amplifier depending on the wattage it has been tuned to can and will give you one powerful bite and it will hurt badly make your antenna by the tried and true formulas dipole antennas often are the easiest to build and then turned into inverted v antennas by raising the center of the antennas up into the inverted v style it s a good idea to have your antenna at least one half 1 2 wavelength of the antenna one quarter 1 4 wave is the minimum height above ground for effective performance wire j poles for vhf are easily built and can be used in an emergency these inventions simply use the ever popular 300 ohm antenna lead in wire you can use them for any frequency including the hf bands but you will need a tall tower or a high tree to hang them high in the sky as of this writing 300 ohm antenna wire is pretty scarce a roll of 300 or 450 ohm antenna wire was 55 00 just a year ago now if you can find it from any source the same roll costs 95 00 here s several other feed lines you may consider to use choose which ever line fits your particular need rg8 mini 8 can handle up to 2 kilowatts rg8u which is the large wire with either foam or plastic center insulator and can be used up to 3 kilowatts hard line such 9913 series is the best for vhf or uhf transmissions 300 ohm covered ladder line is great if you have a long run say more than 150 feet 45 7 m open feed line is trouble but you can use it if it doesn t act like like an antenna if you cut open ladder line in less than a wave it can act as your antenna instead of your radiator antenna element avoid using odd lengths of transmission line and try to do the wave lengths version to prevent parasitic transmissions and falling on your neighbors antenna or bleeding off into someones cell phone or perhaps even setting off home alarm systems that are close in your neighborhood car alarms that are not shielded can oft times be set off by using certain frequencies please take note here if you are running amateur radio and it s been checked out it s not your fault that your neighbors are having problems it s the poor design shielding and the sensitivity of their equipment that is at fault sometimes a solution can be reached other times there is no solution other than they have to put a filter or a suppressor on their equipment to keep their equipment from malfunctioning and acting as a receiver the fcc also states that our equipment must not cause unwanted interference from occurring in order to defend yourself make note of the frequency you were using at the time the incident occurred and if you have not had your equipment tested have your equipment put on a spectrum analyzer or a harmonic detector to prove your equipment is not causing any unwanted interference if your equipment is clean then it s up to the other party to take action to prevent them from getting on the ham band screen your vhf and mhf bands there are frequencies that we use that can cause malfunctions of rc cars airplanes and robots its not the hams fault it s mainly due to a flaw in design shielding or it could be that these toys are acting as a receiver such was a case not long ago and we will discuss the outcome of that incident but first let us talk building antennas maximum output what is maximum output the term peak envelope power or pep is the maximum output power allowed by law peak to peak envelope cycling from an ac source rf output with recent changes to some laws the local government can also regulate how much power you can use legally amateur radio operators can run up to 1500 watts that s a lot but consider this a ten thousand dollar set up with a 50 cent antenna isn t gonna serve you well whether you live in the country or in the city the antenna is the root of good transmit receive functions formulate then make the way to find out what length you need for a dipole antenna which is the most common antenna used you use mathematical equation 468 fmhz whereas 468 is the one standard the fmhz is frequency in megahertz and that give you the total length of a dipole antenna in feet divide by 2 and place a ceramic dog bone or even pcv pipe insulator between them in the middle where you just cut and you got a dipole antenna attach a feed line and run to your tuner or if you are gonna use resonant antennas attach to your swr meter and check for high swr readings usually less than a 1 5 to one or less is acceptable but a 1 1 match reading is the very best using resonant antennas can be the most fulfilling experience of antenna use however space and materials can pose a factor in using several antennas that are resonant to each band raising or lowering the antenna can help with swr but also one more thing to keep in mind it s a good idea to raise the antenna at least 1 4th wavelength above ground inverted v antennas can be tied off as high as possible but can go as low as 3 or 4 feet 0 9 or 1 2 m from the ground place a warning sign on the tie off point if your antenna is low enough to touch telling anyone that high voltages can be present at any time and not to touch the wire in any way stretch out the legs of the antenna as much as possible and pull them as high in the air as possible the more capture area that is available the better the transmit or receive secure line with good strong nylon or rayon rope use either 1 4 or 1 2 inch 0 6 or 1 3 cm plastic nylon or rayon rope and then you will find that these works best but you should inspect them at least twice a year for frays or weathering problems replace if necessary making a new design for many years now designing antennas has been a passion for many a ham operator the next one on the list is a cage dipole for this you will need either 4 or 6 inch 10 2 or 15 2 cm thick wall pvc sewer or water pipe and a way to cut it in either 1 4 or 1 2 inch 0 6 or 1 3 cm spreaders use of a compound mitre saw makes this job easy use a 12 saw to cut the 6 and 4 inch pipes watch out though since the last foot of the pipe could buck against the saw and may not cut through the pipe and throw it back at you cut only where it will not be dangerous usually 12 to 14 inches 30 5 to 35 6 cm of the pipe will be left if you own or have a friend who owns one of the saws use it to cut the pipes once they have been cut measure the outside diameter of the pipe spreaders on the outside in metric cm and mm after you have the circumference divide by 6 if you are using 6 wires or divide by 8 if you plan on using 8 wires for this project after you have the pattern down use a drill with a 1 8th or a 5 32ths drill bit depending on the gauge wire used to put 6 or 8 holes in each spreader be accurate as possible do not use the same formula for the cage dipole it will be shorter than a regular dipole it is relative to the size spreader used you can only use the original formula as a starting point depending on spreader size you may have to reduce the length by as much as 4 or more just remember that you will either use 6 wires or 8 wires electric fence wire is often a choice in this type of an antenna as it is relatively inexpensive and can be bought in large rolls of one quarter or half mile or more wire on one spool tin wire will work in this project however copper is best using anything other than copper can compromise performance measure carefully although not critical at this point it s always better to go a little too long than too short and then have to add wire cut full run lengths of 6 or 8 wires its always a good idea to have a couple friends working with you when it comes to this project make the wires you have cut come together at the center when you have done your measurements assembling your antenna and this where the fun comes into play slide 5 spreaders on the wire using 4 of them easing them all the way down to the other end next space the spreaders with the wires through the holes at intervals of either 18 or 20 inches 45 7 or 50 8 cm apart put contact cement on the tooth picks or match stems before sliding them into the holes with the wires to hold them firm leave one spreader at the first end that way it will show you where to place your wires into the spreaders continue with the spreaders using 4 or 5 spreaders at a time leaving one at the end each time tighten wire and then peg the wires with the sharp toothpicks or wood matches using only the wood on the matches after you reach the end of one side of the cage gather up all the loose wires at both ends and tie them together using a piece of wire wrapping all wire ends together near the center of the spreader lay this leg of the dipole aside and do the same with the other leg make it count whether you use 18 inch 45 7 cm or 20 inch 50 8 cm spacings in between the spreaders to make it look good don t change the spreaders in alternately positions if you use 18 inch 45 7 cm spacings use them all the way to the end of the antenna if you use 20 inch 50 8 cm spacings use all spacings at 20 inches 50 8 cm apart larger wires in gauges of 14 or 12 can add weight to this project so it takes a lot to get these antennas going don t rush this project take your time do it right the first time and then you can rest assured that your antenna will serve your purpose the capture area of a 6 wire cage dipole has increased 5 times an eight wire antenna increases gain of capture by 7 although it is hard to work with and build this antenna for amateur radio use it s one of the best zoom xoom and voila one of the best kept secrets of amateur radio antennas are either the box or delta loop antennas resonant antennas cut to the exact frequency in the middle portion of the band and used with a tuner of sufficient size can tune several bands the formula used to find a full wave loop antenna is 1005 fmhz this gives you the length of a full wave loop antenna for the band you are using horizontal positioning into a triangle shape makes it a delta loop if you put it into a square or rectangle shape you have a box loop antenna out in the country is where this antenna is most often used it requires a large area of land and also it can be fed either in the middle or an end portion of the loop when hoisting this little monster of an antenna into the air watch out as we said before for power lines trees that are spaced far enough apart provide ample heights above ground for this antenna trees are often called poor mans towers and either can be accessed for use by using several methods including a good fishing pole and a 4 ounce sinker properly aimed at a high branch in the tree when it is successful tie a masons line or even affix the rope you are going to use to the line and gently roll in your catch over the branches of the tree and pull it down to the ground don t forget to use adequate lengths of rope or safety cord for this project you can use pvc pipe here as an insulator cut 3 or 4 pieces of 1 1 2 inch 3 8 cm pvc pipe about 6 or 7 inches 15 2 or 17 8 cm long drill 1 2 inch 1 3 cm holes using a good drill bit and never drill close to the end of the pipe about 2 inches 5 1 cm from the end gives you a good spacing for the insulators for the feed point use yet another piece of pvc pipe drilling a hole through the center to provide for a strain relief for the feedline put the stress on the pipe not on the antenna or on the feedline pull up your antenna into the trees or your tower very carefully making sure that it is as close as possible to the design you chose to make the antenna box or rectangle loop or a triangle spacing them out as much as possible yes you can fudge a little if you have to on the sides making one a little longer but its best to keep your antenna as practical as possible to the design,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to create a simple am radio,radio stations broadcast on medium wave bands and send signals into the air all around us only a few simple parts are needed to pick up am radio waves some electronic components wire a paper tube and a speaker assembly is simple and doesn t require any soldering this simple radio will be able to pick up signals transmitted within 50 kilometers 31 mi,gather your supplies you likely already have many of the parts you ll need for this project excluding some of the electrical components these can be bought at most hardware stores home centers and electronics stores you ll need 1 megaohm resistor x1 10nf capacitor x1 15 20 inches 38 51 cm of red insulated wire 15 20 inches 38 51 cm of black insulated wire 45 60 feet 14 18 m of 26 awg 0 4 mm enamelled wire for the inductor 200pf variable tuning capacitor 160pf will do up to 500pf works 22uf electrolytic capacitor 10v or higher x1 33pf capacitor x1 50 100 ft 15 30 m insulated wire any color for the antenna 9 volt battery x1 electronics breadboard electrical tape operational amplifier type 741 or equivalent also called an op amp 1 x research source x1 toilet paper tube or small non conductive cylinder 1 75 2 inches 44 51 mm in diameter glass bottle cardboard plastic tube etc speaker wire strippers or a similar item like sharp scissors or a knife small knife or medium grit sandpaper make an antenna the antenna is one of the simplest parts of a homemade radio all you need is a long piece of wire ideally the wire should be 50 feet 15 2 m long but if you don t have that much you can use as little as 15 or 20 feet 4 6 or 6 1 m when choosing wire for your antenna prioritize small diameter insulated wire like ones in the 20 or 22 gauge as these work best boost the reception of your antenna by looping its insulated wire into a coiled circle you can keep the coil from unraveling with zip ties or electrical tape loop 50 feet 15 2 m of wire about 5 times cut and strip jumper wires jumper wires will connect components installed on the breadboard later cut one piece of black wire and one piece of red wire so that each is about 5 inches 12 7 cm long 2 x research source use wire strippers or a sharp knife to remove about 0 5 inches 1 3 cm of insulation from both ends of each piece of wire jumper wires can always be cut down to size if they turn out to be too long so you may want to cut these a little on the long side at first make a coil to serve as an inductor when you wrap wire around a cylinder with no space in the windings of the wire it allows the wire to pick up radio waves as electromagnetic energy 3 x research source this process sounds complicated but making one is simple wrap 90 turns of enamelled wire into a tight coil around a cylinder 1 75 to 2 inches 44 to 51 mm in diameter 4 x research source start winding your inductor at one end of the cylinder leave about 5 inches 12 7 cm of slack where you fasten the wire with electrical tape to the lip of the cylinder wrap leaving no gaps in the windings aim for cylinders 1 75 to 2 inches 44 to 51 mm in diameter avoid metal cylinders because metal will throw off your signal wrap the cylinder completely to finish the inductor the more windings your inductor has the more inductance it has 5 x research source and the lower the frequency it will tune to continue wrapping until the whole cylinder is completely coiled with wire fasten the end with electrical tape then measure another 5 inches 12 7 cm of slack and cut the wire off at this point since the wire is covered with enamel scrape the ends with a small knife to reveal 0 5 inches 1 3 cm of bare copper so that we can connect it to the circuit alternatively use medium sandpaper to sand the ends the windings of your inductor can also be held in place with a liberal application of hot glue or a similar adhesive 6 x research source position the breadboard lay your breadboard on the table in front of you lengthwise so its long edge faces you which side faces up won t influence how the breadboard works the five holes in a column are electrically connected to each other but not to any other column circuit components like capacitors and resistors are connected by being inserted into adjacent holes in a column on the breadboard 7 x research source there is one exception to the connections on a typical breadboard the long connected rows at the top and bottom of it connect left to right not up and down like the rest of it there are usually two rows on the top and two on the bottom we will use only one row on the top and one row on the bottom place your op amp on the breadboard notice that the op amp has a small semi circular divot on one edge which is used to orient it properly if there is no divot there should be a small circular depression or dot on one corner hold the op amp so that the divot or dot is on your left the printed logo letters and numbers on the device are the right way up when viewed this way most breadboards have a long trough running across the middle separating the board into two equal halves place your op amp with the divot on the left centrally on the board so that four pins are on one side of the trough and four are on the other this will allow an uncluttered layout with the input the antenna and tuning capacitor on one side of the breadboard and the output the speaker on the opposite side 8 x research source the pins of amplifiers are numbered to identify the pin numbers place the divot the left of you pin 1 is the first pin on the left of the bottom row sometimes in addition to or instead of the divot pin 1 has a circular depression or dot above it the pins are numbered consecutively from 1 starting on the bottom row and continue counter clockwise on the other side of the device confirm the numbering of the legs of the amplifier after installation is as follows on the bottom row moving left to right 1 2 3 4 from the leg opposite 4 moving right to left 5 6 7 8 9 x research source the only pins used in this radio are pin 2 inverting input pin 4 v pin 6 output pin 7 v it is important not to reverse the polarity to the op amp as it will destroy it the op amp is now oriented so that the top and bottom row match the polarity of the v and v pins when they are connected to the battery later this layout avoids crossing the jumper wires and possibly causing a short circuit put your 1 0m ohm resistor over the op amp current flows both ways over a resistor so you don t have to worry about its orientation on the board 10 x research source place one lead into the hole directly above the op amp s 6 pin the opposite lead should be connected to pin 2 of the op amp place the 10nf capacitor insert the short lead of the 10nf capacitor into the hole directly below the connecting lead of your 1 0m ohm resistor in the bottom row of op amp pins next place the long lead of the 10nf capacitor in a hole four columns to the left 11 x research source hook up the 22uf electrolytic capacitor stick the short lead negative side of the 22uf capacitor in the hole directly above the lead connecting your 1 0m resistor to the top row of op amp pins the long lead can be put into a hole four columns to the right of the short lead 12 x research source electrolytic capacitors only accept voltage going in one direction electricity must enter in through the shorter lead applying voltage incorrectly can cause the capacitor to fail in a puff of smoke 13 x research source add the jumper wires to the circuit use the red jumper wire to connect the hole directly above the 7 pin of the op amp and the nearest free hole of the long connected rows at the top the black jumper wire connects pin 4 of the op amp to the nearest free hole of the bottom long connected rows place your 33pf capacitor in the hole above the lead for your 10nf capacitor that isn t yet connected anything insert one lead for your 33pf capacitor the other lead of the 33pf capacitor can go in an empty hole four columns to the left 14 x research source this capacitor like the first one you placed isn t polarized so current can pass through it in both directions it won t matter which lead goes in which spot attach the antenna the antenna yet unused until this point is now ready to attach insert one end of the antenna into the hole directly above the empty lead of the 33pf capacitor this is the same lead you just placed out of the way four columns away to the left 15 x research source you can improve reception by spooling the wire of your antenna across the room as far as possible or by winding it into a coil as described in the step on making the antenna connect your variable capacitor insert one lead of the variable capacitor into the hole above the rightmost lead of the 33pf capacitor the other lead connects with the black jumper wire in the long connected row at the bottom attach the inductor coil use the 5 inches 12 7 cm of slack on either side of the coil to fasten it with the variable capacitor and black jumper wire in the long connected bottom row the remaining lead attaches at in the hole below the junction of the variable capacitor the 10nf capacitor and the 33pf capacitor 16 x research source plug in the speaker place your speaker on the table to the right of the variable capacitor the red lead goes into the topmost row of the board to connect with the red jumper wire the black lead goes into the hole directly above the unused lead of your 22uf electrolytic capacitor on the right side of the capacitor in many situations you ll need to untwist the wires for the black and red leads attached to your speaker so they can be tied in to the radio circuit attach your power source now that your circuit is finished all it needs is some juice use electrical tape to attach wires to the positive and negative sides of the 9 volt battery then add the positive wire usually red to any hole on the topmost row of the breadboard so it connects the speaker and the red jumper wire add the negative wire usually black to any hole on the bottommost row of the breadboard to supply the black jumper and variable capacitor with current 17 x research source listen to the speaker for noise once the circuit has power the electricity will begin to flow to the amp and the speaker the speaker should now be making sound though it might only be faint noise or static this is a good indication that all of your components are correctly connected turn the variable tuner to adjust the frequency turn the variable tuner slowly to shift the frequency your radio is reading and find audible radio stations the further away from am radio stations you live the weaker the signals will be be patient and turn the knob slowly with a little patience it s likely you ll be able to pick up an am radio station troubleshoot the circuit circuits can be touchy and many require troubleshooting especially if this is the first circuit you ve ever built all leads need to be firmly inserted into holes and each part of the circuit needs to be hooked up in the right fashion for it to operate sometimes you may have thought that you ve pushed the lead all the way in to the board without it actually making a good connection inspect your connections on the breadboard to see if you have not connected a component in an adjacent column the adjacent columns are not connected therefore that component will not be connected to the others and may even be connected to the wrong item the rows at the top and bottom on the breadboard are separate make sure that the holes where the jumper wires are plugged in belong to the same row not adjacent rows some breadboards have the top and bottom rows split into a left side and a right side 18 x research source this is used when there are 2 different voltages in a circuit in this radio there is only one voltage is used if the jumper wires are connected such that one is in the left side of a row and one is in the right side of a row the radio will not work the solution is to connect the jumpers in the same group of 5 holes of the same row or to bridge the two rows with a small jumper wire at the middle of the rows adjust connections until you can hear audio when power is supplied if this fails to work you may need to rebuild the circuit from scratch 19 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to create an internet radio station,internet radio stations are accessible from anywhere in the world this makes it a popular service for expatriates and for listeners with interests not adequately served by local radio stations internet radio stations offer content across genres that is simulcast over the web with a netcast stream,find a designated space though having an online radio station is accessible and simple it is still nice to create your own designated studio space if you can find a corner of a room in your home or a small room where you can add acoustic enhancement you ll want to keep your computer there as your base of operation along with a large desk get a microphone 1 x research source you don t need much gear to create an internet radio station however if you plan on talking on your radio show or inviting guests to your station you ll want to invest in a good microphone consider how many people you want to have on your station speaking at a time if you only plan on streaming music with no talk breaks you won t need a microphone consider acoustics if you do plan on speaking a lot on your radio station you ll want to think about improving the acoustics of your studio area to listen for the acoustics in your room walk around and clap your hands listen to see if your hear a harsh ringing or a light reverberation 2 x research source if you hear something closer to the ringing you ll want to add some acoustic treatment add acoustic panels to your walls if you can make the furniture in this area plush and add soundproof foam consider a

how to start a low power fm radio station,you have the means to start a low powered radio station without a fcc license low powered fm radio stations are a good resource for nonprofits schools churches community groups and unions note that the fcc rarely hands out permits for commercial free radio 1 x trustworthy source federal communications commission independent u s government agency responsible for regulating radio television and satellite and phone communications go to source luckily there are alternative ways to get your voice heard through the fm airwaves,understand unlicensed broadcasting unlicensed broadcasting is legal using a low powered transmitter which was discussed in part 15 of the fcc s rules these devices are limited to 200 feet 61 meter range the transmitters are manufactured under the regulation of the fcc and have visible indicators for you to tell 2 x research source one of the disadvantages of this system is that you have to accept any disturbance from a higher powered radio station find an available frequency on the radio before you take into account the necessary expenses of a low power fm radio station you should seek out availability the fcc allows commercial radio stations to bleed into or overpower your radio station search through your local fm stations and find a station without any radio programming the key is to find the purest static channel make sure there aren t other voices or sounds lingering in the background if there are a couple clean stations in a row then you re in good shape if you live in a metropolitan city like chicago or l a you will have trouble finding a station like this you can do a quick check by visiting radiospark org rfree for a search of available stations in your area find out what type of station your community needs you are a member of a community and feel the need to power a radio station that your community is lacking consider if other members of your community want the same type of programming on the airways a good way to receive feedback is by creating flyers with information about your radio station hang the flyers around town and in community active spots like a coffee shop library or a venue space if the station becomes popular it is legal to profit from advertisements say on the flyer what do you want to hear on the radio in big bold letters and then explain what your station does make a list of necessary equipment it ll help you keep track of what you need by making a quick list of all the equipment you ll need to power the station this includes a transmitter antenna and basic sound equipment microphones mixer cd player etc take a quick inventory of media devices you own like a turntable cd player cassette player etc do a basic search online to determine a rough price of the gear you ll need create the mission and vision for your station mission statements are meant to be a brief write up of your organization this is an area where you can share the philosophy model you are basing your radio station around other items to include are your goals and your performance standards these are goals to strive for with a mission statement to make it

benefit your long term goals look into some organizations that could be interested in your radio station once you find a local organization draft a letter explaining your fundraising goals and include your mission statement 5 x research source there are many websites that allow you to make a fundraising pitch online gather your source equipment your source equipment includes a cd player cassette player record player or other form of media players you aren t required to have this equipment available but it will benefit you if you are a music based station consider getting used audio equipment from craigslist or other music posting websites use a reliable computer there are many benefits to having a computer for your radio station and studio you can generate the bulk of your station s broadcast with only a computer playing music miscellaneous sounds and even your own voice many radio stations record shows on computers and play them at a selected time over the airways if you are first starting out a computer will cut down on a lot of your audio costs you can upload your radio show as a podcast or as an internet radio station with a computer get a microphone and audio console unless you plan to play music alone you should invest in at least one microphone if not two you will also need an audio mixer to switch between multiple audio outputs like a turntable microphone and computer for a good quality microphones invest in a sennheiser md 421 or a shure sh 55 6 x research source there are options if you don t want to deal with audio equipment you can invest in a usb microphone that goes directly into your computer these mics have been continuing to grow and offer a range in quality consider getting help from a tech savvy friend if you re beginning to feel overwhelmed obtain other audio equipment asides from the microphones and mixing boards you ll need cables to attach everything together most transmitters take an ⅛ jack headphone jack so you ll need to use the right converters for your mixer other cables that might help you are xlr cables for microphones and rca cables for external audio players if you went with the usb microphone you don t need to worry about this step you ll also need one or two sets of headphones depending on how many people plan to talk for future endeavors you should have two headphones or more if you use multiple headphones you will also need a headphone splitter acquire a part 15 transmitter search through the internet for a professional grade low powered fm transmitter there are several options available that are all verified by the fcc you can spend a small amount of money 80 or spend a larger sum of around 300 7 x research source for a cleaner signal shop for a mono transmitter opposed to a stereo transmitter some transmitters come with an antenna but these models aren t as powerful or reliable use a good antenna remember a good antenna is a must for clear and long transmission an antenna that works well on one frequency may not work as well on another some audio stores will have antennas for fm transmitters but you will probably have more luck shopping online you can also purchase a custom antenna tuned to your radio frequency check out radio brandy for custom antennas http www radiobrandy com fmantenna html prepare a few programs if your station is dedicated to music prepare music specials if your station is about science create some interesting programs related to science consider if you want the length of your programs to be 30 minutes or an hour you could also plan to do a quick 10 minutes of talking every hour of a music show plan for a week of broadcasting and choose certain programs for individual days consistency is important for programs to develop a following the key to planning programs is that each show is exciting in some way when in doubt throw on a catchy playlist plug everything in before going live you should ensure that everything is plugged in and properly connected together follow each cable in your system and double check each end to be sure everything is in the proper place do a quick test of your broadcast and check the levels on your audio mixer or computer tune to the station power your transmitter on and tune to the radio frequency you choose that isn t occupied by another station if you haven t found a station yet go through the fm stations using a normal radio take note of the channels that don t have any broadcasting 8 x trustworthy source federal communications commission independent u s government agency responsible for regulating radio television and satellite and phone communications go to source begin broadcasting have a friend listen to the station in a separate room you can t have the radio tuned to your broadcasting station in the room with you when the microphones are turned on it can create feedback that will be audible over the radio when the microphone is turned off you can listen to the radio in the same room consider the future build your station up to fit your own means and eventually you can build it into a legitimate station it is good to begin broadcasting with a part 15 transmitter to

how to use a shortwave radio,shortwave radio also known as high frequency hf radio is considered by some to be the first internet shortwave 3 30mhz signals travel great distances especially at night and can be tuned to listen to broadcasts originating in other countries earning shortwave radio the nickname of world band radio sound quality can vary greatly but is largely intelligible in just a little time you too can become a swl a shortwave listener,compare radio features and quality by going to a store that has a selection of short wave radios from which to listen analog shortwave can be found at 30 70 and well beyond amplitude modulation am is a common mode for broadcasters but there is also single side band ssb mode an ssb radio will receive both ssb and am modes but an am only mode radio will not allow intelligible ssb monitoring digital tuners sometimes called pll or phase locked loop are more expensive but make it easy to precisely tune and lock on a particular frequency drift is virtually eliminated these tuners can also easily scan and memorize frequencies however many inexpensive digital tuners present the listener with chopping sounds or automatic muting while tuning that analog tuners do not exhibit this would only be a problem when attempting to scan shortwave bands for content not when there is a specific frequency that you wish to tune see tips upgrade to a larger and or external antenna to improve reception google swl antenna for ready to install types from manufacturers or make your own nearly anything will be better than just the telescopic rod type antenna included with the radio adding long length of wire clamped to the rod antenna with a simple alligator clip can work wonders move the wire around to find the optimum location for best reception become familiar with shortwave bands there are multiple shortwave bands named 25 meters 31 meters 49 meters etc each band encompasses a specific frequency range some radios show frequency in megahertz mhz and other in kilohertz khz you may need to consult your radio s manual in order to find out how to get into specific bands generally most bands have the clearest signals at sunrise and sunset although some are better at night and others are better during the day see sources below scan the shortwave bands and find content hit or miss annual publications like world radio tv handbook and passport to world band radio provide frequencies and schedules of broadcasters there are websites that will tell you which broadcaster is using the frequency 1 x research source as well as provide a schedule of english language shortwave broadcast 2 x research source some people look for certain kinds of content foreign stations this pursuit is often referred to as dxing dx is the telegraphic shorthand for distant specialized shortwave utility or ute transmissions e g maritime naval aviation or military signals numbers stations broadcasts of voices reading in unidentified code the origin is uncertain and the purpose is suspected by many to be espionage interactive communication between amateur radio operators request and collect qsl cards by sending an swl short wave listener reception report to a broadcaster this is optional but many shortwave listeners enjoy collecting qsls as keepsakes and you provide the broadcaster with valuable feedback and information to put together an swl reception report you ll need to record the following information when and how the station identifies itself the name of the program content of the news or other program names of the announcer s items unique to the locality of the station how well the signal was received using the sinpo code signal refers to the strength of the signal received interference indicates whether other stations were interfering with the signal noise identifies the presence of atmospheric or other noise on the frequency propagation refers to the fading characteristics of the signal overall tells the station how well you received their signal,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to host your own talk radio show,have you ever been listening to your favorite morning show dj during your daily commute and thought to yourself this seems easy i can do this while radio broadcasting can be a rewarding way to make a name for yourself and affect the lives of thousands or even millions of listeners it s not always easy hosting a radio talk show once meant paying your dues for years as a low level radio employee today however the internet has given talented amateurs the chance to make a name for themselves to learn how to host your own talk radio show see step 1 below to get started,get involved with a local station if you re starting with zero experience the best way bar none to get any sort of radio show is to start participating in the process of creating an existing radio show working or volunteering in a radio station gives you an introduction to the workflow and regular tasks that go into producing a successful radio show it also gives you much needed experience to put on your resume when you re applying for airtime most importantly it gives you a chance to make contacts inside the station knowing someone in the industry can make all the difference in the world when it comes to landing your first show radio station staff are much much more likely to hire people they know and trust to be show hosts than they are to hire strangers one great idea for building up your radio station experience is to try volunteering for a local community radio station like for instance a college radio station these stations are usually not operated for profit and depend on the work of volunteers to stay on the air which means it can be relatively easy to find a place on the staff compared to a for profit station get an internship some radio stations offer internships and apprenticeships to interested applicants especially young students some of these internships are integrated with a local school or college s communications department which means that they usually recruit solely from the pool of students in the department while other internships may accept applicants from the general public depending on the amount of time you work an internship can sometimes be more useful for getting a show than working from the bottom up in the station good internships are career focused and offer opportunities for employment after the completion of the internship however even with an internship it may be necessary to work in the radio industry for several years before getting a show if possible get a broadcasting education following the correct educational path for becoming a radio host will only help your chances of getting your own show also as noted above educational programs often pave the way for valuable internship and apprenticeship opportunities if it s financially feasible for you to do so consider earning a degree in communications or broadcasting to boost your resume and give you valuable background knowledge and experience it s worth noting that an educational background in communications or broadcasting isn t absolutely necessary for a successful career in radio several of the most recognizable names in radio like howard stern have communications degrees but others have no pertinent educational background for instance adam carolla one time host of loveline and the adam carolla show completed only a partial junior college education which included work in a ceramics major 1 x research source be prepared to pay for time on for profit stations though all stations will have their own rules for their show hosts generally local for profit stations will charge the hosts for their show time 2 x research source times where listener numbers are high like morning and afternoon commute times are generally expensive while less popular times are generally cheaper the hosts can pay for their shows with their own money solicit donations from viewers or sell advertising time to third parties if they make more money from advertising fees than it costs to keep the show on the air they generally keep the difference as a profit successful radio hosts can support themselves this way understanding ahead of time that you may need to pay for your show time is crucial you don t want to pursue a coveted time slot only to find out that you can t afford to run your show because of the cost of hosting a radio show it s often a wise idea to retain another job at least until you can generate enough advertising revenue to support your show dedicating yourself full time to your radio career is great for your show but not if you run out of funds and have to go off the air in a few months costs vary for instance at some local stations radio time can cost anywhere from 60 200 per hour depending on the time slot consider starting with internet radio for first timers to the world of radio broadcasting the internet offers a way to get your voice hear with very few if any up front costs and no experience requirements if you have the computer know how you may want to set up a dedicated audio stream to broadcast your show see how to stream live audio or an online guide like the one here you may also want to try a cheap or free online broadcasting service like live365 com cheap free trial or radionomy com free for 9 months with conditions the downside of having an internet radio show is that it s basically up to you to promote your own show and grow your audience you won t have the resources of an established station to help you another great option is to record a regular podcast podcasts are essentially pre recorded talk radio shows that listeners can download and listen to as they please for more information on podcasts see how to start your own podcast or scroll down to the podcasting section below pick a theme or format for your show before you start broadcasting you ll want to have decided on a purpose for your show while many shows are remarkably flexible in terms of their structure and the topics they cover in general most successful talk shows have a pre defined theme or goal this can be quite broad so don t feel the need to pigeon hole your show with an extremely specific theme simply ask yourself what is my show about below are a few common talk radio show themes to get you started news current events political commentary music news underground music discussion humor parody educational topics history science etc advice relationships diy projects etc niche topics paranormal conspiracy theories etc schedule out your show s time beforehand don t wing it in the studio unless you re an experienced broadcaster scheduling or blocking out the time you have available for your show is a must especially if it s your first show having a plan beforehand allows you to keep the momentum of the show high and makes it harder for you to run out of things to talk about during your first few shows you ll inevitably discover that your schedule doesn t perfectly match with reality some segments may take longer than you anticipated while others take less time take note of these differences and adjust your schedule as needed let s say that we ve just gotten our first 90 minute political talk radio show here s an example of a schedule we might have for our first show 5 minutes theme song and introductions 20 minutes guest interview author jane smith 15 minutes discussion topic 1 minimum wage too high or too low 5 minutes ads 10 minutes take calls 15 minutes discussion topic 2 gerrymandering how big of problem is it in the modern age 5 minutes ads 10 minutes take calls 5 minutes allow guest to plug upcoming events follow with farewell and outro music have a consistent recognizable structure when it comes to talk radio consistency is key listeners want to be confident that they ll be able to hear the same content and style of discussions whenever they tune into your show some change may be unavoidable for instance if a particular aspect of your show isn t working out it s better to drop it than allow it to limp along as an unpopular part of the show however whenever possible you ll want to keep the basics of your schedule the same from one show to the next while allowing for fresh content in the form of new segments and so on invite new guests and old favorites to participate in your show one way to keep your show fresh and interesting while keeping its format consistent is to continuously invite interesting exciting guests on to your show guests bring their own knowledge and conversational style to the show contributing to enlightening or at least entertaining discussions usually in exchange for coming on the show the guest is allowed to promote his or her personal projects on air the types of guests you should invite will vary based on the format of your show for instance if you re running a serious art criticism talk show you might invite guests who offer new perspectives and unique expertise like professors and artists on the other hand if you re hosting a crass shock jock comedy show you might want to invite fellow comedians or even bizarre local personalities take calls from listeners it s almost always a good idea to encourage a friendly open atmosphere between yourself and your callers if you ve got an active audience it s easier to keep the momentum of your show s dialog high than if you don t opening up your phone line to callers allows you to briefly take a break from thinking up new interesting avenues of discussion instead you can let your listeners direct the conversation for you all you have to do is respond if you re on a station with rules against profanity be on the lookout for prank callers always know how to quickly disconnect a call if your station operates on a time delay be aware of how to delete the last few seconds of airtime in the event that a caller says something inappropriate most stations will have an easily accessible delay button somewhere near the main sound board if you re broadcasting online you may want to experiment with taking callers via voicechat software like skype otherwise you may want to have a text chat channel for your listeners which you occasionally monitor for relevant discussion avoid dead air whether you ve got a show on community radio with a tiny local audience or a nationally syndicated morning show you ll want to follow the golden rule of radio broadcasting avoid dead air distracting periods of silence ordinary pauses in conversation are one thing you don t need to be talking for every single second of your show however you will want to avoid stretches of silence that are more than a few seconds long these are awkward to listen to sound unprofessional and can lead to an immediate dip in listenership if it sounds like you re having a technical error you may find that it s a good idea to keep a piece of new music or a similar audio clip queued up and ready to play in the event that something takes you by surprise and you need a few minutes of time seek out advertisers as noted above it s a very real possibility that you may have to pay for your show s airtime to help pay for your show try to find advertisers who are willing to put up a little money to have their message broadcast on air advertisers can pay you a fee or agree to cover some of the costs of your show in exchange for you dedicating a chunk of your airtime to ads some radio show hosts read the advertiser s ad themselves while others opt to play pre recorded ads generally rates for radio advertising increase with the length of the ad the desirability of the time slot and the number of listeners to the show ad prices can also vary greatly by market for instance 60 ads in a market like los angeles can cost up to 500 while the same number of ads might go for as little as 3 in a small rural town 3 x research source don t forget to promote your show never forget that as a radio show host you live and die by your listeners the more listeners you have the better with more listeners you can charge your advertisers more per ad negotiate more lucrative deals with your station and promote yourself and your guests to a wider audience so always be trying to increase your listenership by promoting your show one great way to do this is by advertising on other shows especially those in desirable time slots that broadcast from the same station as you many stations offer a reduced in house rate for cross promoting your show consider recruiting a co host for talk radio shows having a second or third or fourth person in the studio with you every show makes your job easier in just about every way imaginable most importantly co hosts offer their own unique personality and thoughts to every discussion you have ensuring that your own voice and views don t get stale it also allows you to have friendly debate the back and forth between a pair of co hosts who can lovingly bicker is often one of the most entertaining parts of a talk show if you re thinking of getting a co host make sure it s someone you get along with and who understands the commitments of the job co hosts have other benefits too for instance some may be willing to split the cost of airtime with you or help search for and book guests schedule regular features for the listener some of the fun of listening to their favorite shows is from anticipating listening to and even participating in their favorite recurring features as long as you obey the rules of your station and of course local laws there s virtually no limit when it comes to what sorts of segments you can run so be creative below are just a few ideas to get you started call in trivia contests for prizes or recognition live or pre recorded man on the street segments 100th caller wins type contests soliciting listeners for certain types of stories on air creative comedy improv exercises create memorable one off segments just because your viewers are likely to appreciate the consistency of recurring segments doesn t mean that you should necessarily shy away from special one time events and features experimenting with new ideas while keeping the basic format and structure of your show intact allows you to continually innovate and surprise your audience it s also a good way to find new directions for the show to go in anything that gets an especially good reaction can eventually be made a recurring segment build a relationship with frequent contributors if you notice that certain people seem to call in to the station on a regular basis or that certain guests seem especially popular with your listeners don t let these people go to waste instead try to create a friendly working relationship with them talk to these people off the air and ask if they d like to become a regular part of the show even if they aren t interested in joining the show as a dedicated cast member they may appreciate being made a friend of the show or gaining recognition as an official contributor for instance if one of your callers has a boisterous outrageous personality and insane political beliefs you may want to have a semi regular segment where he calls in and comments on the issues of the day create an on air persona some talk radio shows especially those that examine or critique serious topics are dignified affairs however many talk shows are known for the exaggerated crass or outlandish characters assumed by their hosts if your show is mainly interested in entertaining your listeners consider creating such a character for yourself the interplay between a crazy host character and a straightman co host or an unwitting caller can make for great radio when in doubt learn from the greats no one s radio show is perfect from the get go it can take years of experience to develop your broadcast craft to the point that you can deliver a great show every day during this time it s a great idea to look to some of the best radio shows and podcasts in the world for inspiration there s no shame in getting ideas from those who are already successful they too had role models in the world of broadcasting before they became famous for instance howard stern cites radio host bob grant as an influence 4 x research source below are a few great radio shows and podcasts you may want to consider listening to this american life politics serious issues human interest stories the howard stern show shock jock style raunchy humor the ron and fez show humor chat car talk no longer running automotive advice comedy bang bang podcast absurdist comedy improv the bugle podcast news politics record your show to the listener the difference between a radio talk show and a podcast is minor both involve listening to a host and or a set of co hosts talk about familiar subjects with or without a guest however for you the host recording a podcast is a little different than recording a live show you ll perform your show basically as you normally would but rather than broadcasting it live you ll record it and offer it for download on the internet to do this you ll need to an equipment setup that allows you to record reasonably high quality audio files and sufficient hard drive space to store them for the most basic podcasting needs you can get away with a computer and a reasonable quality microphone which usually run upwards of 100 at audio equipment stores edit your audio file after recording your show you may want to listen to your audio file and if necessary cut out any portions that you don t want to make the final podcast to do this you ll need audio editing software some free programs like audacity are available online insert ads intro and outro music or anything else you d to add to your podcast when you re done save your file in a widely used audio format that will be easy for your audience to use like mp3 upload your show to a hosting site make your podcast available to your listeners online a variety of free hosting sites like youtube com soundcloud com and many others allow you to upload audio files with a free account note that with these sites per file bandwidth limits may require you to split your podcast into multiple parts you may also want to try hosting your podcast on online audio stores like the itunes store google play store and so on generally most podcasts are offered to the listener for free and are supported by donations sponsors or advertisers charging money for your podcast can decimate your potential listenership when you re competing against literally hundreds of good free podcasts so it s not usually a good idea optionally create a blog or website for your podcast generally the most professional podcasts have their own websites which contain links to the podcast episodes as well as podcast news a store for merchandise and so on you may want to purchase your own domain name and build your site from scratch but for

how to make a crystal radio,making a crystal radio is a fun and relatively simple project that allows you to listen to nearby am radio stations aside from the germanium diode and earpiece the radio can be constructed with things you re likely to find around your house toilet paper and paper towel rolls masking tape screws wires and scrap metal and wood the process involves making a capacitor coils a holder and then connecting it all together with wires,gather your materials empty clean paper towel roll two 6 inch by 6 inch pieces of aluminum foil one piece of 7 inch by 7 inch white paper printer paper will do two 1 foot long pieces of wire masking or some other non conductive tape x acto blade or wire strippers scissors cut two 6 inch by 6 inch pieces of aluminum foil use a felt pen and ruler to draw the 6 by 6 squares on the foil before cutting them out fasten one foil square around an empty paper towel tube start about a half an inch up from the bottom of the tube wrap the foil around the tube and fasten it with masking tape if you don t have masking tape you can use any other type of tape as long as it isn t electrically conductive electrical tape is another safe bet fasten the other foil square to to a piece of white paper the paper should measure 7 inches by 7 inches and the foil square should sit right in the center or it so that it looks like a silver square inside of a white one use masking tape to fasten the foil square to the white paper tape all around the foil square to ensure it sits smoothly against the paper fasten the paper foil square around the paper towel roll wrap the square around the roll with the aluminum side facing out and tape it to create a tube the paper foil square should form a tube that s slightly larger than the paper towel roll the fit should be snug but not so snug that you can t easily move the paper towel roll in and out of the paper foil tube be sure to have the aluminum foil facing out so that the paper touches the roll you want to insulate the two foil squares from each other so make sure they don t touch strip the last inch of insulation from both foot long wire pieces you can use an x acto blade to gently cut around and strip the insulation from the wire be sure that you don t damage the bare wire if you have them you can also use wire strippers to strip the insulation from the wire bend the bare wire ends at 90 degree angles take the bare ends of both pieces of wire and bend them at 90 degree angles this should be easy to do with just your fingers attach one wire to the paper foil tube tape one of the bare wire ends to the top corner of the free moving free moving aluminum foil paper tube the one that you ve placed over the paper towel tube use a few pieces of tape to ensure that the wire is well attached to the foil it must touch the foil as that is what will conduct electricity attach the other piece of wire to the foil on the paper towel tube tape the bare end of the other one foot length of wire to the top corner of the foil square that s on the paper towel tube the wires should sit across from one another so that you could draw a line between them along the length of the tube move on to your coils now that your capacitor is complete you can move on to making your coils gather your materials one toilet paper roll insulated wire most will do 26 gauge enamelled magnet wire recommended masking or other non conductive tape sandpaper ensure that the toilet paper roll is free of debris make sure it has no glue or left over bits of toilet paper stuck to it before you begin place two pieces of masking tape along the length of the toilet paper roll place one piece of tape along the length of the toilet paper roll and then cover that piece of tape with another piece of tape the second piece of tape should exactly cover the first one let a piece of the second piece of tape hang over the end of the roll as you ll need to lift this back up as you add wire to your coils be sure to leave a foot of wire at each end of both coils leave a foot long piece of wire sticking out from each end of each coil these should be at both the top and bottom of each coil these pieces are what you will use to connect the coil to other wires you ll have 4 one foot long pieces of wire sticking out in total one at the top and bottom of each of the two coils start your primary 25 turn coil peel back the second layer of masking tape and place a piece of wire beneath it then close the tape over it to anchor the wire there wind the wire around the toilet paper roll 25 times being sure to make tight close winds don t forget to leave a foot long piece of wire at both the start and finish of your coil 25 turns will work out to roughly 13 feet 4 m of enamelled wire enamelled wires are ideal for the coils because their coating is easier to remove once they re coiled and you will need to remove some of the coating in order for the tuning bar to work with the coil we ll come to this later finish the primary 25 turn coil lift up the second strip of tape place the wire beneath it and place tape back down to fasten the wire there be sure to leave a foot of wire free when you cut the end of the coil start your secondary 90 turn coil lift up the tape and place another piece of wire beneath it roughly 1 8th of an inch down from the end of the primary coil fasten the wire to the roll by closing the tape over it and then wrap the wire 90 times around the roll as with the primary 25 turn coil make sure that the wire is wrapped in tight close turns 90 turns will work out to roughly 42 feet 13 m of enamelled wire finish the secondary coil lift up the second layer of tape and secure the final turn of wire beneath it clip the wire off leaving a foot of wire free don t forget to leave a foot of wire on each end of the coil for connecting to other wires lightly sand the surface of the secondary 90 turn coil you only need to sand a small amount of the surface roughly a half inch to an inch at the top of the coil will do be very gentle and be careful not to sand between the wires sanding between the wires will cause them to short into each other and will make your coil ineffective bare the ends of the 4 pieces of wire sticking out from the coils each coil will have a foot of wire hanging from its top and bottom remove the enamel insulation from these ends so that you can connect them with other wires if the wires are enamelled you can sand them scrape them or dip them in nail polish remover to bare them gather your materials note that you can use scraps for the wood and metal pieces one piece of wood for the base at least 8 inches wide by 12 inches long two pieces of wood to hold the capacitor at least 6 inches long and roughly 1 5 inches wide needs to fit inside capacitor one small piece of wood to mount tuning bar on around 1 inch thick by 2 inches long will do the height should be the diameter of your finished coil piece of metal for tuning bar strip from paint can works pliers to help bend metal screws to connect wooden pieces together screwdriver your homemade capacitor your homemade double coil toilet paper roll masking or other non conductive tape screw together the capacitor holder take the two pieces of wood that are roughly 1 5 inches wide by 6 or more inches long and screw them together to form an l shape these pieces of wood do not have to be the exact same length many people use scrap wood to construct the base so if you have other sizes lying around you are welcome to use those just make sure that the piece of wood on which you ll mount the capacitor is small enough to fit inside the capacitor attach the capacitor holder to the right side of the base place the base down flat in front of you use screws to fasten the holder to the top right corner of the base on the longer side so if the base is 8 by 12 inches do this on the corner edge of the 12 inch side the bottom of the l should be lined up with and perpendicular to the right end of the base the top of the l the longer side of the l should be parallel with the base once fastened it should look like a rectangle with one invisible side or like a horizontal toilet paper roll holder which is essentially what it is place the capacitor on the mount ensure that the movable paper foil tube side is facing outward so that you can easily adjust the size volume of the capacitor use a thumbtack to fasten the other paper towel roll side of the capacitor to the mount attach the tuning bar mount to the base it should sit on the right side of the base across from the capacitor mount roughly 3 or 4 inches in from the right end of the base leave room 2 5 to 3 inches at least between the tuning bar mount and the capacitor you ll be placing the toilet paper roll double coil in this space if the base s bottom is quite thick you can use strong glue to connect the tuning bar mount to the base instead of screws make the tuning bar cut a thin strip of metal and bend it lengthwise so that it makes a v shape keep the last half inch or so of the tuning bar flat this is the side that you ll attach to the mount the bottom point of the v is what you ll place on the secondary coil in order to tune your radio attach the tuning bar to the tuning bar mount puncture the flat end of the tuning bar and use a screw to attach it to the end of the mount that s closest to the capacitor mount be sure to firmly but gently screw the tuning bar in so that you can still move it around make sure it s not too lose as you ll be tuning the radio with it and need it to stay where you put it fasten the coil to the base in front of the tuning bar exactly where you place the coil will depend on the length of the tuning bar place the coil at a distance from the tuning bar that allows the bar to sit on top of the coil you need to be able to move the tuning bar back and forth over the secondary coil much like a windshield wiper moves across a car window you can use masking tape to fasten the coil to the base just place a strip on the inside of either side of the coil and connect it to the base gather your materials 1 x research source long wire for

wires to connect do the same as you would with one wire but with all of them you can do them one at a time or take all the wires you need and twist them all together at once whichever you find easiest it is easier to twist smaller wires onto thicker wires than the other way round connect a wire to a ground source to make your ground wire you ll need to connect a bare part of your wire to a piece of clean bare metal that goes down to the ground common sources of this include cold water pipes faucets and steel support beams if you use pipes go close to the wall to find ones that aren t insulated or enamelled you may have to scratch them up a bit to bare some metal and make the pipes more conductive tape the ground wire in place on the left side of the base this will be connected to the adjustable side of the capacitor as well as the wires coming from the right ends of the 25 and 90 turn coils so keep that in mind while placing it on the base attach a wire to the tuning bar loosen the screw holding the tuning bar to its mount wrap the bare end of a wire around the screw and then gently retighten the screw make sure that the wire touches the tuning bar both ends of this wire need to be bare as they will conduct energy from the tuning bar to the ground wire connect the following capacitor and coil wires to the ground wire twist them all together tightly wire on the adjustable paper foil side of the capacitor should be on the left side of the base wire on the right bottom end of the primary 25 turn coil wire on the right bottom end of the secondary 90 turn coil wire attached to the tuning bar tape the antenna wire in place on the left side of the base it will be connected to the top left end of the primary 25 turn coil so keep that in mind while placing the antenna on the base the antenna can be any wire insulated or bare although insulated is recommended most important is that the antenna is as high and long as possible and that it is not grounded i e connected to any ground sources such as basement floors or pipes if tying to a tree metal post etc use a short piece of plastic rope attach the top left end of the 25 turn coil to the antenna twist the two wires together tightly fasten the germanium diode to the right side of the base you can do this with masking tape ensure that the grey stripe on the diode is facing up and outwards towards the edge of the base instead of the coils make sure the diode s wires are sticking out from under the tape as you ll be connecting them to other wires place the diode in line with the right end of the capacitor the paper towel side that can t be extended as this is the wire you ll be attaching it to attach the following wires to the top diode wire these wires will attach to the side of the diode that doesn t have the grey line on it wire on the right unmovable side of the capacitor wire from the top left side of the secondary 90 turn coil attach earpiece to the ground and diode wires attach one wire of the earpiece to the ground wire grouping and the other end of the earpiece to the wire of the diode that remains free i e the one that isn t already attached to the 90 turn coil and the capacitor you ll be attaching the earpiece to the side of the diode that has the grey line closer to it listen to the radio you will likely need to adjust the tuning wand and capacitor before you hear anything start with adjusting the wand and then gently pull out the paper foil side of the capacitor to increase the volume don t over sand your tuning coil if you over sand your tuning coil it could cause each wire turn to become electrically connected which will cause the coil to be ineffective remember to be careful when sanding the coils that you only lightly sand the surface not between the coils ensure that your tuning bar is not insulated depending on what material you re using your tuning bar could have a coating on it that prevents it from being conductive if you re having trouble picking up anything when you test your radio try sanding the bottom point of the tuning bar where it would hit the coil to make it more conductive also try sanding the part of the tuning bar that is under the screw use a high impedance ear piece speaker low impedance speakers 4 8 ohms head phones 8 ohms and earbuds 32 ohms do not work with a crystal radio old fashioned high impedance 2000 ohms headphones from 1940s 1950s are suitable but are rare therefore expensive piezo ear pieces are good because they have a high impedance of 6k 10k ohms 2 x research source old telephone ear pieces that are 150 ohms are not suitable note that impedance is not the same as dc resistance and needs specialized equipment to measure 3 x research source check to make sure you have a good quality ground another possibility if your radio isn t working is that your ground is not of a high enough quality try a different pipe in the house make sure it extends to the ground good grounds include a steel rod for your house wiring check below your electric meter and ask an experienced adult to connect this a cold water pipe sink faucet as long as piping is metal or a steel beam house support 4 x research source decent but less effective grounds include a heating or air conditioner register metal window frame a longer 20 foot ground wire laid on the floor or a ground wire wrapped around a metal drain pipe or water pipe 5 x research source check your antenna the most effective antenna would be a wire run out an upper floor window to a nearby tree branch the higher and longer your wire is the better 6 x research source other suitable choices include a wire run along the ceiling of an upper floor room or hallway or a wire run along a basement ceiling 7 x research source avoid running your antenna along basement floor or inside any metal buildings this would work well for a ground but not for an antenna 8 x research source make sure that the wire does not run close to anything that is conductive metal roofs chain link fences etc,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to become an amateur radio operator or ham operator in the usa,being an amateur radio operator is a fun and a very rewarding hobby in the us you can start with an amateur technician class license issued by the fcc after you pass a basic test enjoy clear 2 way fm communication using repeaters in some cases hundreds of miles away with an inexpensive portable radio you may even talk to astronauts on the international space station ham radios are often used during disasters or other emergencies and for many special events such as the boston marathon join us,talk to other local hams visit a local ham field day event or monitor some ham blogs or radio frequencies and confirm this is something you are interested in doing it takes a bit of commitment to study and pass the exam so you need to understand your own personal motivation to succeed some hams have specific objectives related to emergency teams search and rescue skywarn weather spotting perhaps animal telemetry systems or a general interest in radios and meeting new people with similar interests some hams obtain the license as necessary for other activities such as operating a police scanner in us states that restrict the possession or use no prior experience with radios electronics math science or fcc regulations is required but you will need to learn or memorize at least some of the basics in order to pass the exam find the dates times and locations of upcoming license exams in your area plan to take a test that is not less than three to four weeks away this should provide enough time to prepare for the exam make note of whether or not the scheduled exam allows walk ins or if preregistration is required regardless of which type exam it is if you have a disability be sure to inform the contact person so that s he may make arrangements to accommodate you for this test furthermore realize that the exam is not given by the fcc or its agents but rather it administered by ve s or volunteer examiners the ve s are hams that hold licenses that are at least one grade up to extra class higher than the test they are administering ve s are not compensated for their time and do this work for the benefit of the community and hobby a small fee determined by the fcc is collected by the ve to cover the costs of the testing materials rental of testing space etc ask for a list of items that will be expected of you to furnish on the exam date suitable forms of id etc some clubs offer monthly exams others might only offer exams annually or when there are enough requests decide if a self paced learning or a quick class room session is best for you some clubs offer one and two day licensing the quick licensing method consists of one or two weekends spent in class followed immediately by an exam if this method appeals to you use the link in the last step above tips to contact a club near you to see if it offers ham licensing classes you may find useful online resources to assist your self paced learning obtain the latest test question pool for technician class examination download from the national conference of volunteer examiner coordinators 1 x research source or elsewhere online or purchase a softcover copy from your local radio supplier or bookstore make sure the book contains the current technician question pool because they are updated every four years or so the current pool as of this writing for technician exams should be identified for use during the period between july 1 2018 and june 30 2022 print out the pool questions if there isn t always an electronic device available for use when you have the opportunity to study if the test date chosen falls after the current test question pool expires ask which pool the test will be based upon there are also many online apps you can download and other useful information to help you study and even take practice exams prepare for what is expected the test itself is highly structured it consists of 35 questions selected from each topic area and is a multiple choice format the questions come from the pool of about 424 questions described above each question has four possible answers only one answer however is correct a passing score requires that 26 of the 35 questions be answered correctly the question pool downloaded or purchased in book form lists every approved question and all four possible answers for each question word for word study the question pool to prepare for the test pool questions described above present the correct answer letter in a key at the top of the question read the question review the answers and select the answer that you feel is correct check your selection against the answer provided in the key highlight the correct answer or strike through each of the three incorrect answers as mentioned above the actual exam poses the questions and answers word for word as the pool questions the only difference is the order of the answer choices do not try to learn by associating a question number to an answer letter question 46 is answer b question 211 is answer d and so on after highlighting the correct answers during subsequent reviews read the question and only the highlighted answer do not read the incorrect answers this will assist associating the correct answer with each question dedicate time each day reading the questions and only the correct answers studying twenty to 30 minutes once or twice a day should be sufficient preparation an exam that is 3 or 4 weeks away take practice examinations online or in a downloaded app it s free and an excellent method to determine if you re ready for the test some exam sites to check out http www aa9pw com radio look for the technician exam link on the left side and http www eham net exams try them all and use those you like best when able to score 80 or better consistently you are ready if you can t score 80 or better either wait until you can or take the exam as practice anyway this will let you know what it is like when you are ready who knows you might just pass contact the ve volunteer examiner giving the test once again a few days before the scheduled exam use this opportunity to verify location time etc of the exam make sure the ve s have been able to accommodate any disabilities you informed them of in the first contact with them weeks ago take the exam bring the required documents identification and any certificates if upgrading and exam fee to the session as of this writing 2017 the exam fee is 15 fee may vary from vec so it s also best to ask the ve what the fee is to confirm a exact amount if you fail you can take the test again right away no need to wait for the next exam session a second testing fee may be required however if you miss it by more than a couple questions it might be best to study a bit more before retesting you may also want to be prepared to take the general exam which may be offered to you immediately after you pass the technician exam some examiners allow you to take technician general and extra examinations at one sitting with one fee you will be notified by email or by letter if you have arranged that with the ve when your license and callsign have been issued print out a copy and keep it in your possession to show you are now a licensed ham especially in states that restrict the possession of police

how to start your own radio station,if you love sharing new music or having conversations with your friends you ve probably thought about having your own radio station unfortunately the fcc is not currently accepting applications for new commercial am or fm radio stations you can still start your own radio station by creating one on the internet you can set up a basic radio station with a simple cable or gathering the materials you need set up your server configure an audio source app and stream to your listeners to create a more professional sounding radio station,plug a cable into your computer plug a male to male 3 5 mm rca cable into the headphone and microphone jacks on your computer plugging one end into headphone jack will cause any audio you play on your computer to go through the cable plugging the other end into the microphone jack will allow whatever you re playing on your computer to be broadcast to anyone you stream with 1 x research source you can get the appropriate cable from most music stores or large stores like walmart sign into an online streaming service once you have your cable properly set up sign into any streaming service that you would normally use to talk to your friends online this could be something like skype twitch ustream tv if you want to broadcast to more than one person you ll need either the premium skype subscription or to use a streaming service that allows for group chats 2 x research source play your audio choose the mp3 player you d like to use to create and play your playlists for your station you can use something like itunes or even youtube to play music if you re interested in talk radio you can record your own audio and then play it back directly from your recording software 3 x research source because you ll have a cable plugged in to the microphone and headphone jacks anyone you stream with will hear the audio you play on your computer keep in mind that with your microphone jack occupied though you won t be able to add any live commentary without unplugging it each time use a radio station website if you don t want to mess around with cables you can use a subscription website that creates a radio station for you radioking com airtime pro or looksomething com only require that you pay for and log in to their services you choose your audience size the type of music you want to play and the website does the rest 4 x research source 5 x research source this is not necessarily the best option if you want to broadcast something other than music because you can only choose the types of files that the website provides choose software to create a more professional sounding radio station than what you ll get with a basic streaming set up you ll need software or apps you ll need an app to play music or other audio to turn your audio feed into an audio stream that can be broadcast and one to act as your server 6 x research source there are a lot of options for these types of apps and software but the easiest to work with are winamp for playing audio files edcast for turning your audio feed into a stream and icecast2 for your server download an mp3 dll file to broadcast the audio from your computer over a server you ll need to download a dll which stands for dynamic link library file this type of file keeps all of your mp3 files in one place and allows the other software you need to load the mp3s one at a time this frees up memory and storage space on your computer for an online radio station you ll want to download lame_enc dll type the dll name into your favorite search engine followed by download and it should pop up 7 x research source this dll will allow you to broadcast in mp3 formats and is also compatible with older players you re your audience might use 8 x research source this dll will download as a zipped version so you ll have to open the zipped file to access the individual files you need insert the dll into the winamp app s root directory because you re using winamp to share your audio you ll need to insert the dll file into winamp s root directory this basically makes the audio files on winamp accessible to the other software you need to broadcast your radio station to do this find winamp in the program files on your computer open the winamp program file c program files winamp and insert the dll file where it asks for the source 9 x research source estimate size of audience once you have all of the software you need for your radio station you ll need to figure out how many people you want in your audience this will affect the size and type of server you need it s probably best to start with a smaller number and change it if the radio station becomes more popular ten is usually a good start 10 x research source calculate your required bandwidth once you know how many people you want to broadcast to you can calculate the amount of bandwidth your radio station requires high quality mp3 broadcasts require an upload speed of about 192 kilobits per second kpbs multiple this by the number of listeners you expect or want this will give you your radio station s required bandwidth so for example if you want 10 listeners your bandwidth would be 10 x 192 1920 kbps consider a dedicated radio station server most home internet connections have a maximum upload speed of around 500 mbps this means you could really only broadcast to about two people and you would be using up most of your upload speed on the station if this is the case you might want to consider getting a separate server they cost around 6 per month for an ad free option 11 x research source you can also use a free server but these will give your listeners ads some will just show the ads in their web browser instead of interrupting the audio coming from their radio station check out freemstreamhosting org for one example get the server s host s information for your radio station to stream to the external server you ll need some information from the host make sure you get their ip address or url correct port number stream password and server type usually shoutcast for an external server you ll need to plug this information in later edit the server s configuration menu to get your server up and running you ll need to edit the configuration menu to make sure that the server broadcasts your audio from the correct files open your server app shoutcast for an external server or icecast2 if you re using your home server and click edit configuration then change some of the information within it the sources tag should list your maximum audience size the source password should be the password for your stream app edcast in this example and the hostname tag should be your ip address set the port tag to 8000 12 x research source for the ip address you ll either need to enter your own ip address if you re broadcasting from your home server or the ip address of your external server you should get the external server address from your server host and you can find your own ip address at whatsmyip net save the server configuration once you re done editing click save you should save the server configuration as icecast xml or shoutcast xml in the icecast2 or shoutcast root directory when you re saving this will come up as c programfiles icecast2 or c programfiles shoutcast 13 x research source launch your server once you have your server configured you ll need to start it up to prepare it for your radio station open your server app and click start server in the app s main window 14 x research source download the edcast winamp plugin once you have both winamp for playing audio and edcast for turning your audio feed into an open stream you ll need the plugin that allows edcast to use winamp as its source open winamp then click on options then preferences then plugins under plugins select dsp effect and then choose edcast dsp v3 dsp_edcast dll click configure active plugin to install the plugin to winamp 15 x research source set edcast s output source once you ve set winamp to use edcast as its input source you ll need to set edcast to output to winamp open edcast and click on the picture of the microphone on the main page this turns your computer s microphone off as edcast s source of sound if you disable the mic the edcast winamp plugin will make edcast automatically choose winamp for its output 16 x research source configure the source app for your chosen server open your edcast app and click add encoder this allows you to link edcast to your server settings input your server type shoutcast if you re using an external server icecast2 if you re using your own your server s ip and the port number and password for the app 17 x research source set the encoder type setting the encoder type tells your apps what type of audio files they should broadcast usually acc or mp3 files are the best because most players can play both of these files aac files are okay if you are broadcasting at a lower bit rate but the sound isn t always great and not every player can play it 18 x research source get licensed there are very specific rules governing how you can broadcast music to protect yourself from any sort of lawsuit you ll want to get licensed to play music you can use a licensing server like live365 com or loud city to do this without having to get individual permission from each artist whose music you want to play these services require that you pay a monthly fee based on your audience size 19 x research source record audio if you re starting a news talk radio station rather than a music station you ll need to create your own audio files instead of just relying on music playlists most computers come with some type of audio recording software which you can use to record the audio you want your listeners to hear connect from your audio stream app once you have your server and other apps configured you re ready to connect to your audience open edcast s main window and click connect this connects your server to your playing app 20 x research source play your audio open winamp and begin playing your audio whether music or talk with your audio stream app open and connected to your server you ll start streaming right away share your url there s no point in broadcasting your radio station if no one is listening so you ll want to make sure you share the url of your station if you have an external server you ll get a separate url from the server host if you re using your own server through icecast2 your radio stream will be http youripaddress port mountpoint without parentheses you can find all of this information in the configuration page of your server app share your url everywhere you can think of social media by telling your friends or family in person or even putting up signs at your favorite places to hang out 21 x research source if you don t want to share a url with your ip address you can also register your own domain name for free at http dyn com dns rdr dyndnsorg this will also allow you to choose a website name that tells your audience what they re listening to,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to use a uhf radio,uhf radio is a short range communication band the radio waves in this band are compact making them ideal for speaking in tight spaces such when inside a building they are less useful for long distances or outdoor areas with broad obstacles like trees rocks and walls to use uhf tune your radio to frequencies around 460 470 mhz select a radio channel being careful to avoid ones that aren t reserved or licensed make sure you have any necessary licenses in the usa press the transmission button to make your voice heard to anyone using the same channel and release to return to receive mode,choose a radio tuned to public ultra high frequencies or uhf frequencies uhf is a large portion of radio spectrum from 300 mhz to 3 ghz but specific bands groups of frequencies in it are available for public use roughly in the 460 to 480 mhz range depending on where you live check the labeling on the packaging before purchase most uhf devices including handheld radios will automatically be set to use specific frequencies many radios may be able to monitor other frequencies outside the uhf band many other licensed services use other portions of the uhf spectrum including cellphones and wifi commercial operations and public safety agencies making it important that public channel transmitters only use specific frequencies in america 22 channels of family radio service frs and 30 channels of general mobile radio service gmrs channels exist between frequencies 462 467 725 mhz 1 x research source in australia and new zealand the 80 channels of so called citizen s band radio cb is between 476 4250 477 4125 mhz 2 x research source note that this is completely different from the 40 channel citizens band radio service in the usa located in the 27 mhz range if necessary you can get a portable mobile or base antenna compatible with those frequencies giving your radio better range find them online or at electronics stores uhf antennas are generally quite short because an efficient quarter wave antenna measures around six inches long turn on the radio and choose a channel turn the tuner selection on your radio if it is an older unit without channels already set you ll have to tune into a specific frequency to use it the uhf channels are 12 kh apart from each other and can be found by turning your channel selection dial your device might instead have buttons to select up and down channels the public uhf radio band is divided into 50 to 80 channels depending on your area 3 x research source the gmrs channels share many of the same frequencies as the 22 frs channels many handheld devices have in the past been marketed with both frs and gmrs settings in the usa a personal license is required from the fcc for use of a gmrs radio outside of the 22 shared frs channels or at output power higher than authorized for frs e g 2 watts on 1 7 or 15 22 and a half watt on 8 14 or one without an antenna that is a non removable integral part of the frs transmitter type for example tune into 462 5625 frs channel one for a shared frs gmrs channel some radio receivers have a squelch or quiet control which can be adjusted to limit the noise caused by interference from weak signals adjust the squelch until you hear very little noise or only strong local transmissions push the transmission button to talk anyone who has seen a walkie talkie will have an idea of how to operate a uhf radio wait for others on the channel to stop talking if you hear any press down the transmission button often found on the side of the unit speak into the microphone which can be found on the face of a handheld radio or on an attached speaker microphone headset on larger radios use the handheld microphone attached to the radio by cord and its transmit button when you speak your voice will be sent out on the channel you ve chosen anyone tuned to that channel will hear by letting go of the button your radio stops transmitting and returns to the receive mode follow proper radio etiquette a large part of etiquette is being polite don t interrupt others unless you have an emergency invent a unique call sign which can be anything you want besides your name use call signs to respond to others and state yours every ten minutes or so to check if your radio is still in range of others keep your sentences clear and to the point 4 x research source in the usa anyone using a gmrs transmitter is required to have a call sign issued by the fcc and to state that call sign at the end of each transmission or group of transmissions or every 15 minutes in a long series of transmissions 5 x research source 47 cfr 95 1751 gmrs station identification use clear or over and out and your call sign when your conversation is finished to indicate that others can use the channel learn other radio phrases such as break break break or mayday mayday mayday for an emergency learn the international phonetic alphabet alpha bravo charlie etc as well for spelling out words which will help in an emergency or any time reception is weak or garbled some channels are reserved for specific uses by law or by convention once you reach someone when using a hailing channel both of you should change your radios to select another available channel find out if you need a license for some devices and channels check your government s rules before using the radio to transmit in the usa all radio transmitters must be certified by the manufacture for compliance with specific rules and have an fcc id label associated with its testing and certification for use in frs or gmrs bands in particular a ham radio cannot legally be used in the usa to transmit on frs or gmrs frequencies other than certain limited emergency uses as permitted by statute currently in america you also need an individual personal fcc issued license to transmit with a gmrs radio a gmrs license is for example required for transmission on a radio having outputs exceeding 2 watts even if using an frs frequency 6 x research source in the usa combination frs gmrs radios may use 2 watts on channels 1 7 and 15 22 when you select channels 8 14 your radio will only work under the half watt limit no personal license is necessary for use of frs frequencies because the operator of a certified frs unit is granted a license by rule an frs unit may also communicate with a gmrs unit 7 x trustworthy source federal communications commission independent u s government agency responsible for regulating radio television and satellite and phone communications go to source under australian and new zealand s cb system you do not need a license avoid reserved channels some channels are designated to serve specific functions others are frequented by local groups of people participating in specific functions check the documentation in your area for channel uses for example in australia and new zealand 5 and 35 are used for emergencies 8 x research source in australia and new zealand channel 11 is for establishing contact with someone channels 31 38 and 71 78 are reserved for contacting duplex repeaters furthermore cb radio users also tend to keep 1 8 open for ranged communication 10 for clubs and park guests 11 for locating someone else and 40 for truckers 9 x research source in america some areas may use gmrs channel 6 472 6725 as a distress signalling channel also sometimes configured on frs gmrs radios as channel 20 but limited to 2 watts of output power frs channel 3 462 6125 is also used as a distress frequency 10 x research source there are 8 gmrs frequencies in the usa reserved for use as inputs to repeaters generally in the range of 467 550 to 467 725 channel assignments of these vary among different radio manufactures e g 1 8 on some and 15 22 on others put in a privacy code to reduce noise when public channels are busy your radio may have a setting that allows you to choose a code such as a second channel input button set your main channel first before picking a privacy code when you set a code your radio will tune out all the chatter on that channel other than that from people using the same code 11 x research source different manufacturers have different codes for example motorola uses codes 1 38 all leading to different privacy frequencies 12 x research source using privacy codes does not make crowded channels any less crowded and may contribute to more unintentional interference because you cannot hear others already talking on a channel when your privacy codes are active in your unit it is harder to avoid breaking in rather than waiting your turn privacy channels aren t private anyone who is on the standard channel you chose will hear you you won t hear them because they aren t using your privacy code use your uhf radio lawfully different countries have varied restrictions on how and when you may use the public uhf band under the us regulations of the fcc you are not allowed to transmit advertising to transmit message for which you are being paid transmit obscenities or profanity to intentionally interfere with others or to transmit for criminal false or deceptive purposes 13 x research source you are generally required to yield a channel for emergencies and to attempt to assist others who are transmitting a distress signal it is illegal to transmit any intentionally false distress signals personal

how to use a kite antenna in amateur radio,amateur radio ham radio operators and engineers have been experimenting with radio and antennas since marconi the use of a kite to support an antenna makes for great days operating and a wonderful hf antenna,be a licensed amateur radio operator to transmit on the radio when planning this project keep safety in mind as well first do not fly kites near power lines near airports or where there are low flying aircraft near busy residential or industrial areas or anywhere when there is a chance of lightning moreover be sure to ground the antenna wire as discussed to avoid shock collect the equipment together for this project you ll need the following equipment portable hf radio power supply 12 v battery or mains lifting kite and line the kite that you choose is very important lifting kites usually use just one line and once in the air you have no control over the direction of flight the type of kite can vary from a small box kite to a large lifting kite antenna wire earth rod rf choke or high value resistor antenna matching unit get a strong control line this is the line that provides the security and keeps you kite safely attached to the ground the line will need to be very strong for lifting kites and you will need to see advice at the time you purchase your kite one suggestion is climax dacron it comes in various different sizes check local laws on the maximum height of your kite in the united kingdom it s 60 metres 200 feet above the ground in the usa it is recommended to stay below 500 feet above ground level as aircraft rarely flow that low but do check local regulations first before assuming this is okay 1 x research source select some wire to use for the antenna and also decide how long the wire needs to be taking the uk maximum height of 60m 200 feet we need to do some calculations a kite doesn t fly vertical so to get a kite 60m or 200 feet into the air you will need to let out say around 80m 262 feet of line 80m 262 feet of wire makes for a good antenna on 1 9 mhz or 3 5 mhz the antenna will also work on 7 mhz but you will require an antenna matching unit look for lightweight but strong wire many electronic shops do large reels on single colour wire around 100m per roll equipment wire be aware that some insulated wire is more prone to building up static charges than others for example kynar insulated wire wrapping wire picks up static very quickly surplus antenna wire which consists of braided copper around a steel core works much better and does not build up nearly as much static get an earth rod this is very important as voltages may be induced on the wire you are flying and these need to be discharged safely to ground you can pick up an earth rod from a diy store it is recommended that you use of either an rf choke or a high value resistor 100k for example from the random wire input to the ground this should be connected before launching the kite static can build up on the line very rapidly you will need some incidentals such as a hammer to bang in the earth rod a bungee cord and a couple of climbing style carabiners the carabiners are used to attach the kite line to the kite and also to get the kite down at the end of the day find a suitable flying site check local laws and book the right weather as earlier stated you should not fly your kite close to an airfield or in a busy residential area but this article assumes you have a nice suitable location in mind lay out the kite and run out the control line to its full extent do the following to prepare the kite and antenna for flight beside this run out the wire antenna the wire antenna should be a good 5 to 10 meters longer than the control wire do not connect the wire antenna directly to the control line as this can cause the line to fail the two lines should be separate it is recommended that you use a small length of rope on the kite before attaching the wire antenna secure the main control line to the ground you won t be able to hold the kite because these kites pull far too much so you need to locate a suitable fence or tree you can use a ground stake but these are not always strong enough and you won t be able to pull a tree out of the ground hopefully put the earth rod into the ground in the first instance attach the wire antenna to the earth rod use the rf choke or a high value resistor from the random wire input to the ground have the battery and radio and matching unit close to the earth rod at this point you should be ready to go check once again that the weather is ok with no lighting forecast walk over to your kite ensure the lines and antenna wire are not tangled and launch the kite if the wind conditions are ok this should soar into the air taking the antenna wire with it check the tension on the antenna wire as it s 5 to 10 meters 16 4 to 32 8 feet longer it should sag down below the kite line you can adjust this later earth the antenna matching unit and then connect the long wire antenna you may want to let out a little more kite line to take up the slack in the antenna wire tie a knot in the antenna wire about 2 feet above the ground and attach a bungee cord this allows the kite line to jerk in the wind but dampens the pull on the antenna wire connect the antenna matching unit and tune the antenna for the band you would like to operate get the kite down this can be fun depending on the strength of wind use a carabiner and walk down the line you will find the pull on the line is too great to wind the line in and getting the kite down needs to be completed in a safe and controlled way the line can be very dangerous if it pulls through your hand causing burns or worse the carabiner method keeps your hand and fingers safe and does not cause wear to the kite lines have fun and be safe flying kites can be dangerous exercise all precautions to ensure it stays fun and is not endangering anyone the safety of you and others has to be number

how to find the andromeda galaxy,the andromeda galaxy also known as messier 31 or the great spiral galaxy is one of the most distant objects that the unaided human eye can see use the constellations around the andromeda galaxy to help you pinpoint its location in the sky you can see the galaxy faintly with your eyes but binoculars or a telescope will make it clearer to maximize your view go out on a dark night in autumn or winter locating it for the first time is a little tricky but once you find it it s hard to ever lose it again,go away from the lights of the city any light pollution can make it difficult to find the andromeda galaxy it is best to go away from any urban areas street lights or lit parks take a hike onto a mountain go out into an isolated field or find another area without any light pollution 1 x research source adapt your eyes to the dark the andromeda galaxy is not as bright as other stars around it when you go out to stargaze give yourself fifteen minutes to adjust to the darkness you may realize that you can see more stars than you could at first 2 x research source use a star chart to determine where the galaxy will appear in the sky the position of galaxies stars and constellations can change with the seasons look for a star chart designed for the current month you can often find star charts for free online they are also sometimes sold at planetariums or by astronomical societies the star chart may also tell you what the best of time night to see the andromeda galaxy is based on the season for example in september and october the andromeda galaxy will rise in the eastern sky of the northern hemisphere by midnight it should be directly above your head 3 x research source if you live in the southern hemisphere you might look towards the northern horizon in december to see it it may not rise high in the sky 4 x research source download a stargazing app there are many apps that can help you find the andromeda galaxy and other stars these will adjust the star charts based on your position hemisphere season and time of night these include the star chart app nightsky app and goskywatch locate the cassiopeia constellation if you can find the big dipper look for the bright star next to it this is called polaris or the north star across polaris from the big dipper will be cassiopeia cassiopeia contains five stars in a w shape the right side of this w will point down directly at the andromeda galaxy 5 x research source find the pegasus and andromeda constellations pegasus looks like a giant rectangle you should see two lines of stars extending from the upper left hand corner of this star this is the andromeda constellation keep in mind that the andromeda constellation is separate from the andromeda galaxy look between pegasus and cassiopeia for a smudge the andromeda galaxy lies between the pegasus constellation and the point of cassiopeia it should look like a blur or a hazy oval in the sky draw a line through the mirach and mu andromedae stars start at the star on the upper left hand corner of pegasus the constellation andromeda begins here follow andromeda down two stars you should see two stars stacked on top of one another called mirach and mu andromedae if you draw a line through the two stars and extend it past mu andromedae you should run into the andromeda galaxy 6 x research source mu andromedae is dimmer than mirach it is also the star closest to the andromeda galaxy look for the companion galaxies if you are using a telescope you may find two faint fuzzy spots beside the galaxy one of them m32 is smaller in size and closer to the actual galaxy core the other ngc 205 is larger in size and farther from the actual galaxy both are companion galaxies to andromeda 7 x research source start by locating the galaxy with your naked eye you can see the andromeda galaxy without any special tools it will look like a faint fuzzy oval in the night sky once you have found the area of the sky where the galaxy is located it may be easier to find it with binoculars or a telescope 8 x research source use binoculars for a closer look binoculars will give you a closer look at the galaxy once you find the galaxy with your eye bring the binoculars up slowly and adjust your view until you can find the galaxy it should look like an oval cloud when viewed through binoculars 9 x research source you can use normal binoculars for this the best binoculars to use have 7x50 8x40 or 10x50 lenses 10 x research source use a telescope for a more detailed examination a typical 8 inches 20 cm reflector telescope will let you see nucleus or center of the galaxy as well as its two companion galaxies the galaxy is so large that you may not be able to see the whole thing at once using your telescope 11 x research source if you are using a telescope keep it at the lowest magnification settings while the andromeda galaxy appears quite small to the naked eye it will appear very large when using a telescope look for the andromeda galaxy in fall or winter in the northern hemisphere the best time to view the andromeda galaxy is between august and september in the southern hemisphere you can see it between october and december during these seasons andromeda will appear as soon as the sky darkens 12 x research source it is possible to view the andromeda galaxy all year long in the northern hemisphere although it may be more difficult to find in other seasons 13 x research source choose a night without a moon the moon can also dim your view of the stars you will have the clearest view of the andromeda galaxy if you go out during the new moon or a crescent moon 14 x research source if the moon is full it may be difficult to find the andromeda galaxy a new moon occurs once a month use an online lunar calendar to find the best night for stargazing this month check the weather for a cloudless evening any clouds in the sky will obstruct your view of the stars

how to find the north star,the north star also known as polaris is often used by campers to help them find their way when lost you may also just want to find the north star for fun if you re into star gazing you can rely on constellations in the night sky to find the north star as most constellations you ll need to use are in the northern sky you ll need to figure out which direction is north first if you do not have a compass you can rely on signs from nature to figure out whether or not you re facing north,use the pointer stars of the big dipper you can easily locate the north star by using the big dipper the big dipper contains stars known as pointer stars which can be used to locate the north star 1 x research source to start locate the big dipper the big dipper is a constellation made up of seven stars the constellation is found in the northern sky in the spring and summer months the big dipper will be somewhat high in the sky in the autumn and winter months it ll be lower in the sky 2 x research source the big dipper is given its name because it s shaped somewhat like a bowl with a handle four stars form a trapezoid like shape the bowl portion stemming off of these four stars are three more stars forming the shape of a slightly bent handle 3 x research source once you ve located the big dipper you can use it to find the north star to do so look at the two bright stars that form the side of the bowl farthest away from the handle s tip these are the pointer stars draw an imaginary line connecting the pointer stars extend that line five times the distance between the pointer stars you should eventually reach a somewhat bright star this is the north star note that you do not actually have to see the north star with this method if clouds or trees or mountains are in the way the north star is still there near the end of the fifth pointer length that point is less than three degrees from the north star and the north celestial pole 4 x research source locate the tip of the little dipper s handle the little dipper is the constellation that contains the north star the tip of the little dipper s handle is the north star if you re able to locate the little dipper you can easily spot the north star 5 x research source you can use the big dipper to find the little dipper once you find the big dipper look away from it as if water was coming out of the open part of the dipper the little dipper will appear as a mirror image of the big dipper it is also a constellation made up of seven stars four stars form a trapezoid base and three extend out from this base to form a handle the last star extending outward is the north star 6 x research source if you live in an urban area it can be difficult to locate the little dipper it is also difficult to discern on bright moonlit or hazy nights you may be better off trying another method 7 x research source rely on the arrow in the cassiopeia constellation using the big or little dipper are the most common means to locate the north star however if the big dipper is low in the sky it can be difficult fortunately you can use the constellation cassiopeia to locate the north star cassiopeia is a constellation that consists of five stars they form an m or w shape cassiopeia is located in the north sky in earlier hours the constellation looks more like an m between midnight and dawn the constellation looks more like a w in the months of february and march cassiopeia is especially likely to appear as a w 8 x research source the three stars that form the middle portion of the m or w can be used to roughly locate the north star look at this point as if it were an arrow follow the direction of the arrow forward you should eventually land on a somewhat bright star this is the north star note that you will have to actually see the north star for this method to work 9 x research source locate the north star with your smart phone there are many smart phone applications that work something like a telescope you enter your location or allow the phone to find your location and then point your phone to the sky the phone acts as interactive map identifying stars and constellations for you some applications can also enhance visuals allowing you to see stars more easily sky guide is an application for iphones the app can track your location and time then you can hold your phone up to the sky and it will provide you a map it can identify different constellations and stars 10 x research source for an android there is an app known as stellarium mobile it works the same as skyguide but with a slightly higher resolution you can better see stars and constellations through your phone when using stellarium 11 x research source invest in a star atlas star atlases have been around for a long time if the idea of carrying your phone around while stargazing kills the fun for you consider buying a star atlas instead you should also always take an atlas with you when hiking in the event your phone battery dies a star atlas is a book that breaks down the night sky by the region and time of year you can use the graphics and charts provided in a star atlas to locate the north star on any given night every star atlas is slightly different there s usually a guide in back that provides information on how constellations are labeled for example small stars may be labeled by dots major stars like the north star may be marked by large red dots 12 x research source a star atlas will provide a map much like a map of a town or city guiding you across the night sky on any given night select the map for your specific region and time of year and use that map as a guide bring a flashlight with you as you go out to stargaze so you can consult the map as needed 13 x research source practice using the star atlas before you go camping it can take a while to get proficient at using a star atlas make sure you get lots of practice so if you need to find the north star in a pinch you re well prepared to use your atlas 14 x research source of course where a star atlas really proves its worth is if it makes you familiar enough with the night sky that you don t need the atlas learn the characteristics and locations of the big dipper cassiopeia orion leo pegasus and crux be able to find directions when the need arises unexpectedly and you re without your compass or gps or atlas plan ahead with your computer you can use desktop applications for your computer to know how the sky will look on a given night these devices can help you plan ahead you ll go outside with a rough idea of where you can expect to find the north star in addition to phone applications stellarium also provides a desktop application you can download on your computer to locate the north star it s available for linux mac and windows your background would be the night sky adjusted for your region and time of year it will show you what you can expect the night sky to resemble on a given night locating the north star for you you ll know where in the sky to look when you go out 15 x research source if you have a mac photopills is a photography planning application you can use this if you re planning on photographing the night sky based on your location and the time of year photopills will simulate the galactic arch for you this will form a map you can use later to locate the north star 16 x research source figure out which direction is north using two sticks if you don t know what direction you re facing finding constellations can be a struggle this can inhibit your ability to locate the north star determining which direction is north can allow you to locate the north star more easily you can use two sticks to do so first find two sticks one stick should be slightly bigger than the other 17 x research

between your eye and the two sticks wait for a star to appear in your line of vision 19 x research source stare at the star for a few minutes and wait for it to move it if it moves up you re facing east if it moves down you re facing west if it moves right you re facing south it if moves left you re facing north 20 x research source create a shadow with sticks if it s daytime you may still be able to see the north star however you ll be unable to rely on constellations as they re very difficult to see during the day instead you can create a shadow with sticks and use that to locate north place a stick in the ground take a stone or other object and place it where the end of the stick s shadow falls 21 x research source wait about an hour the shadow will move either growing shorter or longer place another stick at the end of the new shadow then stand at a perpendicular angle to the shadow you are now facing north 22 x research source pay attention to how moss is growing if you re in an area where moss grows you can use moss to help you locate north look for moss on vertical structures such as trees moss requires a damp atmosphere to grow this means moss usually grows on the north side of vertical structures as the north side gets less sun 23 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to get started in amateur astronomy,when you look up at the darkened sky and gaze at the stars some seem to be blinking and you wonder why all of a sudden you can see a shooting star and the little dipper the moon is in an eclipse and a feeling of wonder overcomes you there is so much up there to learn about and enjoy and it is not difficult or expensive to become involved,read about astronomy merely looking up in the sky will not teach you all you need to know so visit your local library and browse through the astronomy section there are a variety of books which are geared toward beginners as well as the more advanced find one that is an introduction to astronomy and learn about the physics of the cosmos surf the internet under astronomy and be assured you will receive a vast array of information as well as pictures visit a planetarium or observatory many observatories have huge expensive telescopes and offer you an exciting as well as informative way of observing the many wonders of the sky check with your local science museum to see if they offer a star gazing night open to the public visit the observatory at night climb up to the tower and observe first hand through their powerful telescopes what you have learned and seen up until now only in books a planetarium uses projectors to offer an artificial view of the night sky the chairs recline the room becomes black and all you see are stars in a darkened sky this is a great way to get started because you will have access to an expert guide to answer your questions you also will get to meet others with similar interests purchase a star atlas or a star map which will enable you to determine what you are looking at while gazing at the sky your library will probably have one but since maps will be an important part of your astronomical study it is best to buy your own if you are unable to afford one then download free star maps from the internet find someplace dark to observe that is away from city glare good choices might include national and state parks inquire at these places about naturalist lead presentations about the night sky as well use your eyes it is not necessary to buy an expensive telescope because the naked eye can see a great deal in the night sky by observing with only your eyes you get a true feeling of how ancient astronomers practiced their craft if you can try to lie down on the grass and look at the sky above you the darkened sky takes on another dimension in this position and creates a feeling of you being totally alone in a vast universe locate the north star and follow the map of the sky make sure you have the correct star map to coincide with the date and location if you have studied the books you might be able to find the little dipper and other constellations or asterisms buy a pair of binoculars if your naked eye observations have gotten you excited about astronomy get a good set of binoculars and observe the night sky with them for a more close up view 10x50 binoculars are excellent for stargazing obtain a telescope there are several types of telescopes with different features uses and prices however you need not purchase the most expensive one in order to enjoy astronomy the most important thing to consider is the telescope s aperture or the size of the light gathering part of the telescope the larger the aperture the brighter your image will be the next most important characteristic is the focal length of the scope which will determine how much of the sky you can see in the image magnification is much less important than quality of optics a good way to choose a telescope is to attend star parties see below and ask a few of the members for permission to try theirs so you get an idea of which models you prefer join an astronomy club amateur astronomy is very popular in most cities and small towns search the internet to find a club in your vicinity or get information by calling a local planetarium for clubs in the u s a go to http www nightskynetwork org a website dedicated to amateur astronomy which will help you locate clubs and events clubs give you the opportunity to learn from others who have more experience and to meet and make new friends with other beginners who have the same interest in astronomy attend a star party star parties are outdoor meetings where amateur astronomers meet and look at the sky together many are already members of an astronomy club this can be quite interesting especially since each person might find a new area star or planet that you might have overlooked subscribe to an astronomy magazine there are a number of periodicals which cater to amateur astronomers among the most popular are sky and telescope and astronomy these magazines provide monthly calendars a wealth of sky watching tips amazing pictures and up to date information on new products and discoveries subscribe to an astronomy podcast such as what s up in astronomy stardate or skywatch they are free and you can search for them in itunes and many other podcast directories join the astronomical league or similar organization membership in these large astronomy organizations will give you the opportunity to network with other astronomers and to participate in observing programs the astronomical league has observing programs for every age skill and equipment level and by participating in a program and submitting your observation log you can earn certificates of completion and a wealth of new knowledge enjoy your new hobby amateur astronomy can be a lifelong pursuit and there s always something new to look at what s more amateur astronomers actually make significant contributions to the study of astronomy and amateurs have discovered stars comets and other phenomena before

how to stargaze comfortably,stargazing can be a rewarding and engaging activity when done right knowing when where and how to stargaze is key to a comfortable experience so the next time the night sky is clear and you want to go out stargazing for an hour or more gather your comfortable clothing and blankets and lay back and enjoy,layer your clothing depending on the time of year you ll need to bring a variety of clothing with you as your body temperature will drop the longer you sit still likewise you might get warm and want to shed a few layers if you stargaze in the fall or winter try thermal underwear sweaters hats gloves or mittens and scarves if you stargaze in the spring or summer wear multiple light layers try a zip up hoodie light jacket hat and jeans bring one warm coat in case the temperature drops dramatically during the night bring a mat chair and pillow you will want to keep your eyes trained on the sky for an extended period of time so comfort is a must your neck will become tired and sore very quickly unless you lay flat on your back or recline in a chair good options for comfort and warmth are a yoga mat pillows tarp in case of dew or damp grass camping pad camping chair or reclining deck chair 1 x research source if prefer to sit up remember to put something between yourself and the ground so that you don t catch a chill use a blanket for comfort and warmth bringing a blanket or two will both keep you warm and add a layer of cushioning to your chair mat or tarp sit under or on top of a blanket or bundle it under your head for extra support don t bring blankets that are not washable anything you bring with you while stargazing may get dirty or wet since you will be outdoors pack food and drinks you may be out for a while so it s important to supply yourself with snacks and beverages sustenance can be both fun and practical so remember to pack things that you like popular beverage options are hot chocolate coffee tea especially during the colder months water soda and beer or wine if you are over 21 and have a designated driver portable energy filled foods you might want to bring are trail mix granola bars chocolate beef jerky soup in a thermos or pre made sandwiches relax your eyes by bringing binoculars binoculars will help you see more stars planets and constellations than you would with your naked eye this way you won t strain your eyes trying to see everything that s up there 2 x research source try a tent or canopy for longer stargazing trips if you think you ll be out stargazing for a while or are worried about the weather bring a tent canopy or tarp that you can set up this way you ll have shelter from the elements and can take a rest if you re feeling tired or worn out you can also store your extra snacks drinks chairs and blankets underneath the covering 3 x research source stargaze on a dry clear night this way you ll see more stars and you won t get wet from rain or overly hot due to humidity 4 x research source a breeze can mean less pollution near a city but strong wind can be chilly so bring extra blankets and sweaters if it seems windy 5 x research source stargaze in the summertime summer nights during june july and august can offer great stargazing conditions you ll also be more comfortable than you would be in the winter and can pack a bit lighter 6 x research source you are most likely to see meteor showers in the summertime the perseids meteor shower is awe inspiring and visible from nearly everywhere in the northern hemisphere it occurs every august 7 x research source some constellations that can be seen year round meaning they are circumpolar are cassiopeia ursa major and cepheus 8 x research source get out of the city for the most relaxation try to avoid major cities and densely populated areas stargazing will be difficult in these areas because of the light pollution and noise they produce for a relaxed stargazing experience you ll want to find some peace and quiet likely in a more rural area 9 x research source watch out for wildlife if you are able to find a sparsely populated rural area to stargaze in chances are good that some wildlife will be around deer bears coyotes raccoons and possums are common camp crashers research what animals are found in your area and keep a sharp eye out while you are outside at night 10 x research source wherever you decide to stargaze always bring bug spray you certainly won t be comfortable if you re swatting at mosquitos all night you can bring a bright floodlight or something to make loud noises with to deter animals that may come near while you are stargazing bring a friend or family member along this is a good safety precaution in case you lose your way in the dark or are nervous about being alone at night you are also likely to spot more stars with two sets of eyes set up on level ground arrange your tent chairs blankets snacks and drinks on an even surface and make sure that everything is within arm s reach of you this way you won t have to fumble around too much and you won t risk losing anything in the dark remember to clean up after yourself both to avoid animal encounters and to protect the environment position your head at a 30 degree angle to the ground this way you won t strain your neck as you look up at the stars and you will mimic the comfort of lying in bed do this by using a pillow re positioning your reclining chair or bundling a blanket beneath your head you can also try lying completely flat on the ground for a fuller view of the sky some people find this posture slightly harder to get up from however use an infra red flashlight to relax your eyes you will need to turn off your regular light once you have set up your area in order to stargaze 11 x research source but if you need to look around after doing so you should use an infra red light to avoid having to re adjust your eyes to the darkness a red light is easier on the eyes and will not disturb your stargazing environment your eyes will need anywhere from five to thirty minutes to adjust to the darkness and turning a bright white light off and on will deter this adjustment process you can cover your regular flashlight with red cellophane rather than buying an infra red light 12 x research source put less strain on your eyes try using the averted vision method of seeing stars and constellations which may be useful if you find it hard to spot faint stars rather than straining your eyes look just to the side of what you re trying to see your peripheral vision is more sensitive to light and dark making it easier to see faint objects when the rest of the sky appears gray 13 x research source enjoy yourself stargazing can be a fun rewarding experience whether you are an amateur or expert stargazer lay back have a snack talk to a friend and observe the night sky as you wouldn t normally be able to,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to name a star,if you were interested in naming a star after yourself or someone you know several companies offer services to name your own star note that the star won t be the official name of the star and it s likely that the star has already been named something else in another registry while the name won t be official you ll receive a certificate and other astronomical gifts that will make you or someone you know feel special 1 x research source officially most stars have already been cataloged with a series of letters and numbers however larger more significant stars usually have a unique name given to them by different cultures or astronomers,search online for star naming registries several non official for profit online registries offer star naming services these registries give you a certificate for your star and other items like photographs of constellations a star map fact sheets and space themed accessories most packages will also include instructions on how to find your star in the sky look online at different companies and compare what they offer to help narrow down your decision 2 x research source the only official registry is the international astronomical union iau they define how stars and other celestial bodies are officially named for astronomical and scientific purposes compare gift packages and choose the one you like the best most online star naming registries will have different packages that you can buy if you want to get more merchandise you ll have to purchase a more expensive package look at the different packages and choose one based on your budget and what they have to offer 3 x research source star naming packages typically cost anywhere from 30 to 100 purchase the star and wait for your certificate to come in the mail once you select the package input your payment details and put in your order once you pay you ll be prompted to type in your desired star name most companies will then pick out a star for you and show you a photo of it in relation to other stars 4 x research source if you re naming a star after someone else you should input their address so that the package gets delivered to them you should receive an email confirmation and a receipt for your purchase email the iau to officially name unnamed comets or meteors though most stars constellations and planets have already been named new comets or meteors typically receive a name based on the person who discovered them if you have a telescope and see a comet or meteor that you don t think was named yet email cbatiau eps harvard edu as you track the comet or meteor make sure to keep meticulous records and contact the iau as soon as possible in the email include your name address contact details date and time of the observation the observation method and the observation site 5 x research source when a comet can be seen by the naked eye you typically can not name it since many other people discovered it at the same time the observation method could include a telescope naked eye or photograph the observation site should include the town or city name and longitude and latitude of your location when you made the discovery usually astronomers and teams of astronomers with telescopes are the first ones to find and name new comets and meteors name a star after someone you know for a thoughtful gift most people will name a star after someone they know as a gift again while the star may not be officially named across all registries the merchandise that you get with the package is a great gift for someone interested in astronomy having a star named after you will leave most people feeling happy and unique 6 x research source you can also name a star after someone who has passed away in honor of their name you can also name the star after yourself think of a name from ancient mythology for a historical approach most stars and constellations have been historically named based on characters from ancient mythology some stars and constellations may have more than 1 name depending on the culture or society that originally coined their names for example taurus was originally named ain in the original arabic text 7 x research source constellations named using greek mythology include andromeda draco and orion name a star by its size and constellation for an official name officially most stars are named by their constellation so astronomers can keep track of them usually the stars will have a designation after the constellation name like alpha or beta to describe their size for example the largest star in the orion constellation is named alpha orionis and the second largest star is called beta orionis 8 x research source alpha beta and gamma come from the greek alphabet this method of naming stars is called the bayer method discover a new star and name it after yourself when new stars are discovered they are named after the person or team who discovered them along with coordinates of the star astronomers or teams of astronomers with high powered telescopes are typically the ones who discover new stars these official names are cataloged by the international astronomical union and have names like luyten 726 8a bd 5deg 1668 and kruger 60 a it is highly unlikely that the star you find hasn t been cataloged but if you believe that you ve found a new star email cbatiau eps harvard edu and include details like the time you discovered the star your name address and contact information 9 x research source there s a good chance the star that you found has already been discovered you can cross reference the iau constellation and star catalogs to see whether the coordinates of your star match an already existing star the coordinates are calculated by determining the star s ascension and declination in space which is the equivalent to longitude and latitude on earth there are millions of stars that have already been cataloged by the international astronomical union don t pick a name you don t like if you keep getting trapped by two names put them together,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to view an eclipse,catching sight of an eclipse is a wonderful event and there are people who invest much time and love into chasing eclipses around the world at its most basic an eclipse occurs when one object passes through the shadow of another while most people are familiar with solar eclipses there are actually both solar and lunar eclipses and both are worth the effort if you re a serious stargazer no words or photos can ever replace the experience of seeing an eclipse for yourself,read about a solar eclipse solar eclipses occur when the sun the moon and the earth are all in alignment allowing the moon to block the sunlight from reaching the earth 1 x research source solar eclipses are observed as a total or partial eclipse depending on whether or not you re located in the umbra the place where the moon s shadow hits a small point of earth or the penumbra the part outside of the umbra the amount of time a total eclipse lasts can be from a few seconds to a maximum of seven and half minutes as the umbra moves along the path of totality there is also an annular eclipse when the moon slides across the sun but doesn t completely cover it 2 x research source total solar eclipses are possible because the sun is 400 times further away from earth than the moon and 400 times larger than the moon allowing the sun and moon to appear to be almost the same size from our perspective of the sky 3 x research source be aware of the methods that shouldn t be used for viewing a solar eclipse you shouldn t look at eclipses through binoculars telescopes any type of glasses sunglasses smoked glass polarizing filters or exposed color film none of these methods are strong enough to protect your eyes 4 x research source 5 x research source although the light wavelengths visible to the human eye are blocked by these objects it is the non visible light that causes damage to the eye the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths still get through and cause just as much damage as the visible light make an eclipse viewer or a pinhole projector a homemade eclipse viewer or pinhole viewer is very simply done and generally speaking it is the easiest and safest way to view an eclipse for just the price of some thick poster paper or cardstock its drawback is the very small image it produces but this one is ideal for children and young teens who will enjoy the process of preparing the pinhole projector and then using it 6 x research source poke a small hole using a pin or thumbtack through the center of a piece of cardstock place a second piece of paper on the ground to serve as the screen you will be projecting the eclipse onto standing with your back to the sun hold the card a few feet off the ground above your shoulder or to your side make sure your head is not covering up the hole it should be held in the direction of the sun and you should be facing the screen you placed on the ground when the projector is properly aligned you should see a perfect circle on the other piece of card you placed on the ground the circle may appear fuzzy at the edges you can bring it into sharper focus by moving the pinhole projector closer or further away from the ground when the eclipse takes place that circle will shrink and turn into a crescent if it is a partial eclipse if it is a total eclipse then it will turn into a thin lined o you can also use a pinhole camera for eclipse viewing use a solar filter on your viewing equipment if you choose to look at the sun with your eyes rather than by projecting the sun onto something else then you must always have a solar filter between you and the eclipse while it is possible to view a total solar eclipse without protection during totality only an experienced observer will know when to judge this moment accurately and when it is essential to immediately place the filter between your eyes and the eclipse again before the sun reappears 7 x research source since most eclipses are partial and most observers are novices it is much safer to only look at the eclipse through a solar filter even the briefest flash of sunlight can damage your eyesight so even 99 9 percent of coverage of the sun is dangerous solar filters are available for all viewing equipment camera binoculars and telescope when selecting a solar filter for a telescope or binoculars it is absolutely vital that you choose a filter made for your exact model and brand if the filter does not fit properly or is used incorrectly permanent eye damage can occur view an eclipse indirectly by making a projection projection of the eclipse image through binoculars or a telescope is another safe method to view the eclipse indirectly however it is only safe if you use it for projection not for looking through do not look through the binoculars or telescope doing the projecting 8 x research source cover the front objective lens of one side of the binoculars with a piece of cardboard or a lens cap with your back to the sun hold the binoculars with one hand and aim them towards the eclipse so that the uncovered lens picks up the eclipse use the shadow of the binoculars to help you align the binoculars watch the image projected back onto a screen wall or large piece of white paper that you re holding in your free hand it should be situated about one foot from the binocular s eyepiece just move the binoculars around until the eclipse image appears on the card screen or wall the further you hold the card away from the eyepiece the larger the image will be when you get used to using this method try fixing the binoculars to something like a tripod or propping them up against a chair or table the image will benefit from the increased steadiness if you re using this method to observe the sun during a non eclipse time shift the binoculars away from the sun every minute to prevent overheating of the equipment let the optical equipment cool down for a few minutes before trying again use welder s glass shade number 14 or higher welder s glass is one of the most affordable and widely available filters you can use to observe the sun with unaided eyes the glass must completely cover your eyes at all times of observation 9 x research source such a filter can also be added to the front of your binocular objectives again all of the lens must be covered and if it can only cover one lens cap the other one use mounted filters there are special types of filters that can be purchased that mount directly onto a telescope or pair of binoculars while some of these can get quite expensive there are cheaper versions that will still protect your eyes and allow you to view the sun there are several important warnings you must take heed of when purchasing and mounting a solar filter 10 x research source you must be absolutely sure that the filter is a proper solar filter as ordinary photographic filters will not filter the dangerous rays the filter must fit your brand and type of equipment perfectly always buy the filter from a reputable dealer if you have any concerns about the safety of the filter do not use it and if you need advice take it to your local planetarium or astronomy club for expert advice check for surface damage prior to mounting mylar is easy to puncture or rip and if that has happened the filter cannot be used be sure that the filter is secure once on if you need to tape it as well as mount it to ensure that it won t come off or loosen then do so do not use filters that screw into the eyepiece end of binoculars or telescopes the focused light can burn through or crack the filter at this end owing to the intense heat of the sun being concentrated just the tiniest crack or separation in the filter can permanently damage your eyes only use filters that mount onto the front end of the telescope read about lunar eclipses lunar eclipses occur less frequently than total eclipses of the sun with a lunar eclipse taking place about twice a year and a total lunar eclipse happening on average every two to three years a lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon travels into the earth s shadow and becomes a coppery or dull red color a blood moon 11 x research source total lunar eclipses can last for up to an hour and forty minutes although a lunar eclipse can last for up to six hours when adding in the time taken to pass through the penumbral region like solar eclipses there are total and partial lunar eclipses that depend on the alignment of the earth the sun and the moon be prepared to stay up late a lunar eclipse occurs only during a full moon when it is perfectly aligned with the earth and the sun the eclipse happens because the earth casts a shadow on the moon lunar eclipses usually occur late at night over a period of hours as the moon passes in and out of the shadow cast by the earth if you want to see the whole thing you will have to stay up late 12 x research source the night must be clear and fairly cloud free for optimal viewing view with your naked eye or through magnifying objects as desired lunar eclipses are perfectly safe to observe with your eyes and without a filter you don t need any special viewing equipment because you are not looking directly into the sun you re actually viewing a projection of the sun onto the moon 13 x research source because there is no risk of damage to your eyes from the sun no special equipment is required 14 x research source to get a more impressive view of the eclipse you can look at it through binoculars or a telescope if you d like to photograph the lunar eclipse read how to photograph the moon for more details on moon photography or how to photograph an eclipse for advice on photographing both solar and lunar eclipses dress appropriately given you ll be viewing at night the air will probably be colder so dress warmly and perhaps take along a thermos of something warm to drink bring along something comfortable to sit on as the eclipse will last for over an hour find out when and where eclipses are happening it s hard to view eclipses when you re not aware they re happening one of the best ways of knowing when eclipses will happen is to use the internet and follow updates on reputable sites in addition some good astronomy books and periodicals will also keep you updated about forthcoming eclipses some of the sites worth keeping an eye on include nasa eclipse website here this has both solar and lunar eclipse details see also nasa eclipse path maps through 2020 and through 2040 some of your favorite science and astronomy information websites and blogs might update you about upcoming eclipses as they re about to happen check the weather forecast leading up to an eclipse some weather elements will make it hard to see an eclipse such as clouds or a storm if it s clear you re all set to watch use this weather forecast to dress appropriately for the eclipse if it s winter and you ll be watching a lunar eclipse you ll want to bundle up to stay warm 15 x research source visit your eclipse viewing site in advance if it s your own backyard you ll already be familiar with it but if you want to go somewhere with a clearer view check it out before the eclipse see what the terrain is like where you can park your car whether it s likely to be popular with other people etc there are actually some key things to look for when selecting a good eclipse viewing spot 16 x research source view choose a spot with a good view of the horizon to enable you to see approaching and departing shadows comfort are there restrooms refreshments shade options etc accessibility is it easy to reach easy to park easy to walk around and so forth familiarity is it likely to attract busloads of tourists if there is ease of access for buses bus parking and you ve seen the site getting buzz on twitter and facebook you might want to find somewhere less well known and therefore less likely to be crowded if you know someone who has a farm ranch or quiet open property in the vicinity of the eclipse consider asking them if they mind you turning up to watch the eclipse,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to make a simple solar viewer,you have probably been told never to look directly at the sun but that begs the question how do you study it the sun is very intense and can do serious damage to your eyes if you gaze at it for even a moment luckily astronomers have a few tricks for getting around this the most common way is to use a solar viewer which allows you to see the sun s image on a piece of paper or cardboard they are easy and inexpensive to make and use and they give you the ability to safely study the sun,cut a 1 inch 2 5 cm square in a cardboard box cut into the short side of a cardboard box this way the light shining through the hole can travel the length of the box to the other side letting the light travel the length of the box will enlarge the image you should use a box that is no less than 6 feet 1 8 m long to produce a clear viewable image 1 x research source if you do not have a cardboard box that is 6 feet 1 8 m long you can cut smaller pieces of cardboard and tape or glue them together to make a box that is the appropriate length make sure the pieces are joined completely and that no light shines through the places where they are connected cover the square with aluminum foil tape a piece of aluminum foil over the hole in the box aluminum foil will block excess light from shining through the hole you created be sure that the foil is pulled tight so that it is smooth 2 x research source make a small hole in the foil use a toothpick or a needle to prick a hole in the center of the aluminum foil this will allow just a small amount of light to be focused through the hole and projected at the other end of the box this will provide an image of the sun that is safe to look at 3 x research source tape up your screen to improve the quality of your image you can project it on a white screen the easiest way to do this is to take blank white paper and tape it at the end of the viewer furthest from the hole one sheet of paper is sufficient 4 x research source aim the pinhole at the sun in order for your viewer to capture the an image of the sun you have to aim it avoid looking at the sun to aim the viewer instead point the viewer in the general direction of the sun and then move it around slowly until you see the sun on your screen 5 x research source view the image of the sun once you have the sun on your screen it is safe to look at you do not need any safety glasses or other special equipment the image is much less intense than actually looking at the sun 6 x research source be safe you should never look directly at the sun even doing so briefly can damage your eyes you have to use a solar viewer to project the image or buy special glasses and or telescopes that filter out enough light to be safe 7 x research source sunglasses will not protect your eyes from the sun only special filtered lenses will be safe watch for patterns if you are serious about studying the sun you can watch for patterns look for sunspots in your image they will show up as dimmer spots on the image observe the sunspots over time and see how they move 8 x research source to make accurate comparisons you should observe the sun from the same place every time brush up on your math skills you can use some basic measurements of your image and viewer to find interesting facts about the sun this is because the image you are viewing is a scaled down image of the sun even though it s smaller it is proportional to the actual sun for example you can find the diameter of the sun by following these steps 9 x research source divide the diameter of the image by the distance from the pinhole the length of the box multiply that answer by the distance between the earth and sun approximately 150 000 000 kilometers or 93 000 000 miles find other ways to watch the sun you can watch the sun without a specially made solar viewer find a tree or other object that provides shade if there are any holes or spaces in the object you can study the spots of sun that shine through you can also hold your hands up and study the sunlight that shines through the spaces between your fingers put white paper or cardboard under whatever you are using to view the sunlight and look at the image of the sun on the paper or cardboard keep in mind that you should never look directly at the sun,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the big dipper,the big dipper is perhaps the most famous grouping of stars in the sky it is part of a bigger constellation of stars called ursa major or the big bear and it features in the legends of many cultures it can help you with navigation and telling time it s not very difficult to spot if you know what you re looking for,find the right spot position yourself in a location where there is not bright lighting you will have a better chance of spotting the big dipper in an area not polluted with light you also should position yourself in a spot where the northern horizon is clear 1 x research source wait until darkness falls you aren t going to find the big dipper during the daytime the best viewing time is between march and june and around 10 p m 2 x research source look north to find the big dipper you need to look into the northern sky determine which direction is north using a magnetic compass or a map tilt your head back so that you are looking up at the sky at about a 60 degree angle during midsummer and autumn the big dipper will be closer to the horizon so don t look up quite so high if you are located north of little rock arkansas you should be able to see the big dipper all night at any hour and any day of the year 3 x research source if you live as far north as new york or further north the big dipper should never sink below the horizon in southern locations it can be more difficult to see the full big dipper in the fall when some of its stars may be obscured determine seasonal differences the season matters here if it s spring or summer the big dipper will be higher in the sky if it s fall or winter the big dipper will be closer to the horizon the saying spring up and fall down will help you remember where to look for the big dipper in the fall the big dipper will rest on the horizon in evening in the winter the handle can appear to be dangling from the bowl you will find the big dipper upside down in the spring and in the summer the bowl will lean toward the ground spot the big dipper the big dipper is shaped like a bowl and a handle there are three stars in the big dipper s handle organized in a line there are 4 stars that make up the big dipper s bowl it looks like an irregular square the entire big dipper looks somewhat like a kite with the string being the handle and the bowl being the kite itself the last two stars of the big dipper s handle are called the pointers they are called dubhe and merak the brightest star is alioth which is the third star on the handle closest to the bowl 4 x research source the tip of the big dipper s handle is called alkaid it is a hot star that means the leader it is the third brightest star in ursa major and six times bigger than the sun mizar is next on the handle after alkaid it actually consists of two double stars megrez is the star that connects the tail to the base of the bowl it is the dimmest of the seven stars of the big dipper phecda is known as the thigh of the bear it is located to the south of megrez and makes up part of the bow find the north star if you can find the north star you should be able to find the big dipper and vice versa the north star is usually bright to find it look into the north sky up about one third of the way from the horizon to the top of the sky which is called the zenith the north star is also called polaris the big dipper rotates around the north star through all of the seasons and through the night the stars of the big dipper are as bright as those of the north star the north star is often used for navigation because it points true north 5 x research source the north star is the brightest star in the little dipper and the end of its handle trace an imaginary line from the north star downward and you should be able to find the two stars in the end of the big dipper s handle which are called pointer stars because they point toward the big dipper polaris is about five stars farther away from the distance between the pointer stars themselves use the big dipper to tell time the big dipper is what is called circumpolar this means it doesn t rise or set like the sun instead it rotates around the north celestial pole throughout the night it rotates around the pole counter clockwise bowl first it makes a complete revolution around the pole once per sidereal day a sidereal day is defined as four minutes shorter than the standard 24 hour day thus you can use the big dipper s rotations to keep track of time 6 x research source study big dipper lore some native americans saw the bowl of the big dipper as a bear the stars of the handle were three warriors chasing it 7 x research source other native americans saw the big dipper s bowl as the bear s flank and its handle as the bear s tail in the united kingdom and ireland the big dipper is called plough which derives from nordic stargazing in which the big dipper was believed to be the chief god odin s wagon or chariot in danish they call it karlsvogna or charles wagon various cultures see the big dipper as something different in china japan and korea it s a ladle in northern england a cleaver in germany and hungary a cart and in the netherlands a saucepan it s a salmon net in finland and a coffin in saudi arabia escaped american slaves found their way to freedom in the north along the underground railroad by being told to follow the drinking gourd thus the big dipper was used as a navigational method the micmacs of canada saw the big dipper bowl as being a celestial bear with the three stars of its handle being hunters chasing the bear learn the big dipper stars distances from earth the stars that make up the big dipper are part of the ursa major moving cluster the furthest star from earth alkaid makes up the handle and is 210 light years from earth the other stars are dubhe 105 light years from earth phecda 90 light years mizar 88 light years merak 78 light years alioth 68 light years and megrez 63 light years these starts are in motion thus in about 50 000 years the big dipper will no longer retain the same shape use the north star to find the little dipper once you ve found the big dipper you should be able to easily spot the little dipper remember that the two farthest most stars in the big dipper s handle point to the north star the north star is the first star in the handle of the little dipper the little dipper is not as bright as the big dipper it looks similar to the big dipper though it has a handle made up of three stars that connects to a four star bowl it is harder to find the little dipper because the stars are not as bright in it especially if you are in a city use the big dipper to find ursa major the big dipper is what is called an asterism that means it is a pattern of stars that is not a constellation it is part of the constellation ursa major the big bear the big dipper stars are the bear s tail and hindquarters the ursa major constellation can be best seen in april at around 9 p m using a drawing for reference there are many online should help you sketch out the rest of the stars that form the big bear once you find the big dipper 8 x research source 9 x research source ursa

how to go to the moon,the moon is the closest body in space to earth with a mean distance of 238 857 miles 384 403 km 1 x research source the first probe to fly by the moon was the russian luna 1 launched january 2 1959 2 x research source ten years and six months later the apollo 11 mission landed neil armstrong and edwin buzz aldrin on the sea of tranquility july 20 1969 going to the moon is a task that to paraphrase john f kennedy requires the best of one s energies and skills 3 x research source,plan to go in stages despite the all in one rocket ships popular in science fiction stories going to the moon is a mission best broken into separate parts achieving low earth orbit transferring from earth to lunar orbit landing on the moon and reversing the steps to return to earth some science fiction stories that depicted a more realistic approach to going to the moon had astronauts going to an orbiting space station where smaller rockets were docked that would take them to the moon and back to the station because the united states was in competition with the soviet union this approach was not adopted the space stations skylab salyut and the international space station were all put up after project apollo had ended the apollo project used the three stage saturn v rocket the bottom most first stage lifted the assembly off the launching pad to a height of 42 miles 68 km the second stage boosted it almost to low earth orbit and the third stage pushed it into orbit and then toward the moon 4 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source the constellation project proposed by nasa for a return to the moon in 2018 consists of a two different two stage rockets there are two different first stage rocket designs a crew only lifting stage consisting of a single five segment rocket booster the ares i and a crew and cargo lifting stage consisting of five rocket engines beneath an external fuel tank supplemented by two five segment solid rocket boosters the ares v the second stage for both versions uses a single liquid fuel engine the heavy lifting assembly would carry the lunar orbital capsule and lander which the astronauts would transfer to when the two rocket systems dock 5 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source pack for the trip because the moon has no atmosphere you have to bring your own oxygen so you have something to breathe while you re there and when you stroll about on the lunar surface you need to be in a spacesuit to protect yourself from the blazing heat of the two week long lunar day or the mind numbing cold of the equally long lunar night not to mention the radiation and micro meteoroids the lack of atmosphere exposes the surface to 6 x research source you ll also need to have something to eat most of the foods used by the astronauts in space missions have to be freeze dried and concentrated to reduce their weight and then be reconstituted by adding water when eaten 7 x research source they also need to be high protein foods to minimize the amount of body waste generated after eating at least you can wash them down with tang everything you take into space with you adds weight which increases the amount of fuel necessary to lift it and the rocket carrying it into space so you won t be able to take too many personal effects into space and those lunar rocks will weigh 6 times as much on earth as they do on the moon determine the launch window a launch window is the time range for launching the rocket from earth to be able to land in the desired area of the moon during a time when there would be sufficient light for exploring the landing area the launch window was actually defined two ways as a monthly window and a daily window the monthly launch window takes advantage of where the planned landing area is with respect to the earth and the sun because earth s gravity forces the moon to keep the same side facing earth exploration missions were chosen in areas of the earth facing side to make radio communication between earth and the moon possible the time also had to be chosen at a time when the sun was shining on the landing area the daily launch window takes advantage of launch conditions such as the angle at which the spacecraft would be launched the performance of booster rockets and the presence of a ship downsite from the launch to track the rocket s flight progress early on light conditions for launching were important as daylight made it easier to oversee aborts on the launch pad or before achieving orbit as well as being able to document aborts with photographs as nasa gained more practice in overseeing missions daylight launches were less necessary apollo 17 was launched at night 8 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source lift off ideally a rocket bound for the moon should be launched vertically to take advantage of earth s rotation in helping it achieve orbital velocity however in project apollo nasa allowed for a possible range of 18 degrees either direction from vertical without significantly compromising the launch 9 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source achieve low earth orbit in escaping the pull of earth s gravity there are two velocities to consider escape velocity and orbital velocity escape velocity is the velocity needed to escape a planet s gravity completely while orbital velocity is the velocity needed to go into orbit around a planet escape velocity for earth s surface is about 25 000 mph or 7 miles per second 40 248 km hr or 11 2 km s while orbital velocity at the surface is 10 x research source 11 x research source orbital velocity for earth s surface is only around 18 000 mph 7 9 km s it takes less energy to achieve orbital velocity than escape velocity furthermore the values for orbital and escape velocity drop the further away from earth s surface you go with escape velocity always about 1 414 the square root of 2 times orbital velocity 12 x research source transition to a trans lunar trajectory after achieving low earth orbit and verifying that all ship s systems are functional it s then time to fire thrusters and go to the moon with project apollo this was done by firing the third stage thrusters one last time to propel the spacecraft toward the moon 13 x research source along the way the command service module csm separated from the third stage turned around and docked with the lunar excursion module lem carried in the upper part of the third stage with project constellation the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket the departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon achieve lunar orbit once the spacecraft enters the gravity of the moon fire the thrusters to slow it down and place it in orbit around the moon transfer to the lunar lander both project apollo and project constellation feature separate orbital and landing modules the apollo command module required that one of the three astronauts remain behind to pilot it while the other two boarded the lunar module 14 x research source project constellation s orbital capsule is designed to be run automatically so that all four of the astronauts it is designed to carry could board its lunar lander if desired 15 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source descend to the moon s surface because the moon has no atmosphere it is necessary to use rockets to slow the lunar lander s descent to about 100 mph 160 km hr to ensure an intact landing and slower still to guarantee its passengers a soft landing 16 x research source ideally the planned landing surface should be free of sizable boulders this is why the sea of tranquility was chosen as the landing site for apollo 11 17 x research source explore once you land on the moon it s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface while there you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on earth and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the apollo 15 16 and 17 missions did you can even hot rod on the lunar surface at up to 11 2 mph 18 km hr 18 x research source don t bother to rev the engine though the unit is battery powered and there s no air to carry the sound of a revving engine anyway pack up and go home after you ve done your business on the moon pack up your samples and tools and board your lunar lander for the return trip the apollo lunar module was designed in two stages a descent stage to get it down to the moon and an ascent stage to lift the astronauts back into lunar orbit the descent stage was left behind on the moon and so also was the lunar rover 19 x research source 20 x research source dock with the orbiting vessel the apollo command module and the constellation orbital capsule are both designed to take astronauts from the moon back to earth the contents of the lunar landers are transferred to the orbiters and the lunar landers are then un docked to eventually crash back to the moon 21 x research source 22 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source head back to earth the main thruster on the apollo and constellation service modules is fired to escape the moon s gravity and the spacecraft is directed back to earth on entering earth s gravity the service module thruster is pointed toward earth and fired again to slow the command capsule down before being jettisoned go for a landing the command module capsule s heat shield is exposed to protect the astronauts from the heat of re entry as the vessel enters the thicker part of earth s atmosphere parachutes are deployed to slow the capsule further for project apollo the command module splashed down in the ocean as previous manned nasa missions had done and was recovered by a navy vessel the command modules were not re used 23 x research source for project constellation the plan is to touch down on land as soviet manned space missions did with splashdown in the ocean an option if touchdown on land is not possible the command capsule is designed to be refurbished replacing its heat shield with a new one and reused 24 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the

how to see the milky way,the milky way can fill a dark summer sky with thousands of stars it is so large that you can see it with your naked eye just go to a dark isolated location if you re in the northern hemisphere look to the south if you re in the southern hemisphere however look straight up above your head you might even be able to find other constellations stars and galaxies as you stargaze,search for the milky way between june and august this will be summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere these months are the best to view the milky way because it is not as close to the sun 1 x research source you may be able to see parts of the milky way as early as march or as late as august between november and february however it is not visible 2 x research source start stargazing two hours after sunset and before dawn the hours just after sunset and before sunrise are still very bright wait at least two hours after the sun has set before you go out stargazing 3 x research source you can use an almanac or a weather website to learn when sunset and sunrise will happen on any particular day use this to plan your trip find a location that has no light pollution light from buildings streets and cars can block your view try to find a rural site that is far away from any towns houses or major roads 4 x research source since the milky way appears in the southern sky you should travel south of any major cities if you do this the light from the city will not interfere with your viewing of the milky way nature reserves mountains deserts and other unsettled areas are great places to view the milky way to find dark areas you can use a light pollution map such as this one http www youcanseethemilkyway com light pollution pick a moonless and cloudless night you may not be able to see the milky way if the moon is too bright or if clouds are blocking the sky before going out to see the milky way pick a clear night with either a new moon or a crescent moon 5 x research source most weather services will tell you both how many clouds there will be as well as what phase the moon is in several apps such as luna solaria or moon phase plus will tell you what phase the moon is in let your eyes adapt for 20 minutes during this time do not use a flashlight phone or another source of light your eyes need time to adjust to the darkness before you can see stars 6 x research source avoid going too far north above a latitude of 50 north it will be difficult to see the milky way this latitude includes anything north of normandy france vancouver canada and inner mongolia china travel south for the best view 7 x research source look to the south use a compass or an app on your phone to point you to the south if you are viewing the milky way in summer you should see the first bands rising from the south it will look like a white cloud of stars or a dense misty cluster across the sky 8 x research source if you re viewing the milky way in spring turn slightly to the west if it s autumn look slightly to the east 9 x research source keep in mind that the milky way will not look like any pictures you may have seen of it cameras are able to pick up more light and colors than a human eye focus near the horizon to see the core of the galaxy look for the densest cluster of stars this will be the core if you are very far north the core may be partially covered by the horizon if you are closer to the equator it may be up above the horizon 10 x research source pick out the great rift by searching for dark patches in the core of the milky way you may see some dark patches these may only be visible in the darkest skies this is called the great rift it is a series of thick clouds covering part of the milky way 11 x research source visit an area that is around 30 latitude you will have a better view of the milky way in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere this includes places like north cape south africa coquimbo region chile and new south wales australia 12 x research source you can still see the milky way in other parts of the southern hemisphere but this will give you the largest view of the galaxy face southwest to see the bands the bands of the milky way will start in the southwestern sky and will sweep along the horizon to the northeast you can use a compass to help you find the southwestern horizon 13 x research source look straight up above you to see the core the center of the milky way will be just above your head lean back your head to see it it will look like a foggy white cloud of stars 14 x research source consider taking a blanket with you so that you can lie down and gaze at the milky way search for dark spaces to find the great rift the great rift is more apparent in the southern hemisphere since the milky way is brighter it will look like dark streaks cutting through the stars 15 x research source bring a star chart to find constellations which constellations you can see depends on your latitude and season a star chart can tell you what you can find look for one that is designed for your location and time of year 16 x research source some common constellations found near the milky way include sagittarius alpha centauri cygnus and the magellanic clouds you can buy a star chart at a planetarium science museum or online you can also get apps like stellarium or skyguide that will download star charts to your phone automatically use binoculars or a telescope for a closer view find the milky way with your naked eye first and point the lens towards it then look through the viewer to see individual stars and galaxies up close 17 x research source any size of binoculars or telescope will work with a higher magnification or aperture you will be able to see more detail but you can still pick out individual stars with a low magnification take a long exposure photograph with a digital camera a photograph will capture the galaxy s magnificent colors and stars to get a good picture change the settings in your camera to a long exposure attach the widest lens you have for the best results place the camera on a tripod point the lens so that you have the widest view of the sky as possible before taking the picture 18 x research source if you can adjust the shutter speed based on the size of your lens divide 500 by the diameter of your lens use the result to set the shutter speed for example if your lens is 25mm then you should set your shutter speed to 20 seconds you may need to adjust the contrast later to get the best results,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the andromeda galaxy,the andromeda galaxy also known as messier 31 or the great spiral galaxy is one of the most distant objects that the unaided human eye can see use the constellations around the andromeda galaxy to help you pinpoint its location in the sky you can see the galaxy faintly with your eyes but binoculars or a telescope will make it clearer to maximize your view go out on a dark night in autumn or winter locating it for the first time is a little tricky but once you find it it s hard to ever lose it again,go away from the lights of the city any light pollution can make it difficult to find the andromeda galaxy it is best to go away from any urban areas street lights or lit parks take a hike onto a mountain go out into an isolated field or find another area without any light pollution 1 x research source adapt your eyes to the dark the andromeda galaxy is not as bright as other stars around it when you go out to stargaze give yourself fifteen minutes to adjust to the darkness you may realize that you can see more stars than you could at first 2 x research source use a star chart to determine where the galaxy will appear in the sky the position of galaxies stars and constellations can change with the seasons look for a star chart designed for the current month you can often find star charts for free online they are also sometimes sold at planetariums or by astronomical societies the star chart may also tell you what the best of time night to see the andromeda galaxy is based on the season for example in september and october the andromeda galaxy will rise in the eastern sky of the northern hemisphere by midnight it should be directly above your head 3 x research source if you live in the southern hemisphere you might look towards the northern horizon in december to see it it may not rise high in the sky 4 x research source download a stargazing app there are many apps that can help you find the andromeda galaxy and other stars these will adjust the star charts based on your position hemisphere season and time of night these include the star chart app nightsky app and goskywatch locate the cassiopeia constellation if you can find the big dipper look for the bright star next to it this is called polaris or the north star across polaris from the big dipper will be cassiopeia cassiopeia contains five stars in a w shape the right side of this w will point down directly at the andromeda galaxy 5 x research source find the pegasus and andromeda constellations pegasus looks like a giant rectangle you should see two lines of stars extending from the upper left hand corner of this star this is the andromeda constellation keep in mind that the andromeda constellation is separate from the andromeda galaxy look between pegasus and cassiopeia for a smudge the andromeda galaxy lies between the pegasus constellation and the point of cassiopeia it should look like a blur or a hazy oval in the sky draw a line through the mirach and mu andromedae stars start at the star on the upper left hand corner of pegasus the constellation andromeda begins here follow andromeda down two stars you should see two stars stacked on top of one another called mirach and mu andromedae if you draw a line through the two stars and extend it past mu andromedae you should run into the andromeda galaxy 6 x research source mu andromedae is dimmer than mirach it is also the star closest to the andromeda galaxy look for the companion galaxies if you are using a telescope you may find two faint fuzzy spots beside the galaxy one of them m32 is smaller in size and closer to the actual galaxy core the other ngc 205 is larger in size and farther from the actual galaxy both are companion galaxies to andromeda 7 x research source start by locating the galaxy with your naked eye you can see the andromeda galaxy without any special tools it will look like a faint fuzzy oval in the night sky once you have found the area of the sky where the galaxy is located it may be easier to find it with binoculars or a telescope 8 x research source use binoculars for a closer look binoculars will give you a closer look at the galaxy once you find the galaxy with your eye bring the binoculars up slowly and adjust your view until you can find the galaxy it should look like an oval cloud when viewed through binoculars 9 x research source you can use normal binoculars for this the best binoculars to use have 7x50 8x40 or 10x50 lenses 10 x research source use a telescope for a more detailed examination a typical 8 inches 20 cm reflector telescope will let you see nucleus or center of the galaxy as well as its two companion galaxies the galaxy is so large that you may not be able to see the whole thing at once using your telescope 11 x research source if you are using a telescope keep it at the lowest magnification settings while the andromeda galaxy appears quite small to the naked eye it will appear very large when using a telescope look for the andromeda galaxy in fall or winter in the northern hemisphere the best time to view the andromeda galaxy is between august and september in the southern hemisphere you can see it between october and december during these seasons andromeda will appear as soon as the sky darkens 12 x research source it is possible to view the andromeda galaxy all year long in the northern hemisphere although it may be more difficult to find in other seasons 13 x research source choose a night without a moon the moon can also dim your view of the stars you will have the clearest view of the andromeda galaxy if you go out during the new moon or a crescent moon 14 x research source if the moon is full it may be difficult to find the andromeda galaxy a new moon occurs once a month use an online lunar calendar to find the best night for stargazing this month check the weather for a cloudless evening any clouds in the sky will obstruct your view of the stars look at weather reports before you head out to make sure that there will be no cloud cover,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the little dipper,the little dipper is a well known pattern of stars situated in the northern sky unlike it s larger brighter counterpart the big dipper the little dipper can be quite difficult to locate even under good viewing conditions the best way to catch sight of the formation is to set out on a clear night in a place with minimal light pollution and scan the night sky for the the big dipper you can then connect the dots of bright stars until your eyes settle on the little dipper,choose a nice clear night to set out plan your outing for an evening with little or no cloud cover most of the stars that comprise the little dipper are quite dim and even a smattering of clouds could be enough to cover it up completely 1 x research source check your local weekly forecast to get an idea of what the weather will be like around the time of your stargazing adventure the farther in advance you re able to plan the better ideally you should wait until the moon is in a waning phase if it s glowing too brightly its radiant light may make the little dipper appear less distinct 2 x research source find a secluded spot with minimal light pollution your best bet is to set out for a nearby rural or undeveloped area if you have one in your area if there are no good fields or clearings around head to a corner of your town or city that s as far away from the most heavily concentrated sources light as you can get 3 x research source streetlamps porch lights and other forms of electrical illumination give off ambient light which can bleed into the night sky and make heavenly bodies hazy or even invisible 4 x research source since the little dipper is already so faint too much light pollution could make it impossible to catch a glimpse keep your distance from buildings trees and other large obstructions the little dipper is so small and unassuming compared to some more impressive star patterns that a tall structure could block it from view picking out an open spot with few potential obstacles will improve your chances of successfully locating the modest grouping of stars 5 x research source even things like tree telephone poles and power lines could be distracting enough to break your line of sight or throw off your concentration do your searching in the spring or summer to improve your chances the position of the little dipper varies slightly based on the time of year the star cluster is at its highest point in the sky from around late march to the end of september because of this the warmer months tend to be the best time to turn your eyes skyward 6 x research source the movement of the earth plays a big part in the way stars appear from ground level since the planet rotates on an axis your geographic location in relation to the little dipper will change with the seasons making it look higher or lower 7 x research source while it s technically possible to catch sight of the little dipper at any time of the year as long as you re in the northern hemisphere it s much harder in the fall and winter when the formation drops and is prone to getting lost in the horizon use virtual aids to admire the little dipper from the southern hemisphere don t worry if you re unable to get a firsthand view of the little dipper from where you live there are many different tools and resources that will give you a glimpse astrology websites and digital star maps for instance can show you the formation s basic structure and position relative to other stars if you d rather hunt for it yourself try downloading a star finder app that offers a full 360 degree view of space such as skyview or star tracker 8 x research source the little dipper and the north star are features exclusive to the northern sky unfortunately that means that none of these star patterns will be directly visible if you happen to be below the equator keep in mind that there are many incredible celestial bodies to take in from the southern regions including the southern cross alpha centauri the sparkling jewel box cluster and the largest satellites of the milky way 9 x research source point yourself north with the aid of a compass if you don t own a traditional compass the compass app on your smartphone or tablet will also help you get yourself oriented correctly the northern sky is home to the little dipper along with its major outlying stars polaris dubhe merak pherkad and kochab you ll be using these stars as guide markers to work your way toward the formation 10 x research source digital star maps and star finder apps often include built in compasses to help you establish your vantage point some even label astral formations and the individual stars that comprise them taking the difficulty out of identifying them yourself 11 x research source search the northern sky for polaris the north star once you re facing north gaze high up on the horizon or straight overhead to see if you can find polaris polaris is the first and most brilliant star in the little dipper which means that if you find it you ve effectively found the little dipper even if you can t make out its full shape 12 x research source consider buying or renting a telescope to zoom in on the stars and simplify the process of locating the little dipper and other groupings and constellations if a telescope is out of your price range you might also invest in some binoculars a strong pair of binoculars can increase your viewing power by up to 70 13 x research source if your goal is to find the little dipper polaris will be your biggest help as it s the biggest and brightest star in the bunch in order to identify polaris however it may sometimes be necessary to first track down the big dipper keep an eye out for the big dipper somewhere in the vicinity of polaris there s no trick for doing this all you can do is simply look up start your hunt in the north as the big dipper is known to rotate around the north star using the big dipper as a reference point will make closing in on the little dipper a breeze 14 x research source keep in mind that the positions of stars can appear to change depending on your location the further south you are for instance the closer to the horizon the big dipper will be if you re further north look for it in the upper reaches of the sky 15 x research source for most amateur astronomers in the continental united states the big dipper is usually somewhere around the halfway point between the vertical limit of the night sky and the horizon look for dubhe and merak if you can t find polaris or the big dipper these 2 stars sit along the outer edge of the bowl of the big dipper they are sometimes referred to as pointer stars as they can be used to point the way to polaris merak forms the bottom corner of the bowl with dubhe in the top corner 16 x research source once you ve located merak and dubhe draw an imaginary line between the 2 stars then extend this line towards the north by about 5 times its length somewhere around you may be able to make out polaris 17 x research source see if you can spot pherkad and kochab in the sky around the big dipper together these 2 stars form the front edge of the bowl of the little dipper pherkad marks the upper corner of the bowl with kochab below it in the bottom corner aside from polaris they are the only stars in the little dipper that are relatively easy to see unaided 18 x research source pherkad and kochab are also known as the guardians of the pole because of the way they patrol around polaris they are the nearest of the bright stars to the polaris and therefore to earth s northern axis 19 x research source kochab a second magnitude star is the brighter of the pair with a distinct orange glow pherkad is a third magnitude star but is still plainly visible under most conditions connect the dots from pherkad to polaris to bring the little dipper into view once you ve singled out the three brights stars of the little dipper pherkad kochab and polaris all that s left to do is scan the surrounding sky for the other four stars finding them will complete the picture giving you a spectacular view of one of the heavens most famous star formations 20 x research source if you happen to spy the bowl stars first start looking for the handle stars remember that polaris is the star at the outermost part of the handle and that pherkad and kochab lie at the other end here s a fun fact because of the way the earth turns the big dipper and little dipper seem to constantly rotate around one another so that when one is upright the other is upside down additionally the handles of the 2 star patterns always point in opposite direction 21 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tell the difference between planets and stars,the night sky is full of light most of which is generated by celestial bodies like stars and planets if you can t tell whether an object in the sky is a star or planet you ll want to learn how to distinguish between the physical features of these two celestial bodies and when it s best to view them,check if the object twinkles one of the easiest ways to distinguish between stars and planets in the night sky is by looking to see if the object twinkles or shimmers this can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough 1 x research source stars twinkle and shimmer hence the song twinkle twinkle little star planets do not twinkle they remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky if viewed through a telescope planets may appear to wiggle along the edges 2 x research source any object that blinks twinkles or shimmers is most likely a star however it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky note whether the object rises and sets celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky all celestial bodies move but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they re stars or planets 3 x research source planets rise in the east and set in the west they tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon stars move around in the night sky but they do not rise or set instead they orbit in a circular pattern around polaris the north star if the celestial object you see appears to move in a more or less straight line across the night sky it is most likely a planet satellites also move across the night sky but they do so much more quickly than planets a planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes identify the ecliptic planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic this belt is not actually a visible object but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated while stars may also appear along this invisible belt they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance 4 x research source of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars this is due to their proximity to the sun since their brightness is just reflected sunlight the easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the earth the sun s path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic 5 x research source observe the color not all planets are colorful however many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration this can help differentiate the planets from stars while some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range 6 x research source for most people stars appear white to the naked eye 7 x research source mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color 8 x research source venus appears pale yellow mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red this is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of mars which changes on a two year cycle 9 x research source jupiter appears orange with white bands saturn typically appears pale gold in color uranus and neptune appear pale blue however they are not usually visible to the naked eye compare the relative brightness while planets and stars both light up the night sky planets typically appear much brighter than many stars 10 x research source astronomers measure the relative brightness of celestial objects using the astronomical magnitude scale with most of the planets falling in the range of objects that are easily visible to the naked eye 11 x research source planets reflect the bright light of our solar system s sun which is relatively close to the earth stars by contrast emit their own light while some stars may be much brighter and larger than our sun these stars are much farther from the earth than the planets in our solar system because of this the planets which reflect our sun s light typically appear brighter from the earth bring star charts and planetary guides whether you have poor night vision or are simply confused about the location of certain celestial bodies a chart or guide can help you determine where to look you can purchase star charts and planetary guides from a bookstore print out free guides from the internet or download a star planetary guide app on your smartphone 12 x research source remember that star charts are usually only valid for a limited period of time typically about one month that s because the position of stars in the sky changes over time as the earth continues along its orbit if you consult a star chart or planetary guide out in the field make sure you use a dim red flashlight these flashlights are designed to provide light without affecting your eyes ability to adjust to the darkness get a good telescope or binoculars if stargazing with the naked eye isn t getting you enough celestial body views you may want to consider using a telescope or binoculars these instruments can help assist your view by magnifying the area you look at this can make visible objects clearer and can even bring objects invisible to the naked eye into your view 13 x research source some experts recommend getting familiar with celestial bodies using the naked eye then trying binoculars and finally moving up to using a telescope this can help you get more acclimated to the visible bodies and their place in the night sky compare telescopes and binoculars online before you invest in one read the reviews written by people who have owned a given model by searching online for the model you re interested in visit a dark sky site light pollution from urban areas can drastically limit your ability to see celestial bodies in the night sky to really maximize visibility you may want to consider visiting a dark sky site 14 x research source these designated sites have been identified by the international dark sky association ida as places worth protecting against encroaching light pollution and urban development 15 x research source common dark sky sites include state and national parks though other dark sky sites are surrounded by well lit well developed regions check the ida website to find a dark sky site near you check whether an occultation is scheduled an occultation is when the moon passes between the earth and a given star or planet obstructing that celestial body s visibility these obstructions happen somewhat regularly and can easily be planned around since their occurrence is predictable 16 x research source occultations may be visible from some locations on earth and not from others check in advance to see whether an occultation is scheduled and whether your visibility will be significantly affected you can find out about planned occultations by searching online or by consulting an astronomy guide the international occultation timing association publishes their predictions online for free 17 x research source identify the moon s phase light reflected off the moon can inhibit your ability to see stars and planets if it is close to a full moon you may have a hard time observing celestial bodies for this reason it s best to check on the current phase of the moon before venturing out to observe the night sky 18 x research source if you aren t sure about the moon s current phase you can consult an online guide to the moon s phases for free the u s navy s website allows you to check moon phases by date as far in advance as the year 2100 19 x research source find the right conditions knowing how to distinguish between stars and planets will only get you so far if the night sky is not very visible your ability to see celestial bodies can be limited by a number of factors both man made and naturally occurring 20 x research source light pollution is one of the biggest limiting factors of night sky visibility if you live in or near a metropolitan area you will probably need to travel to a more rural area to increase visibility cloud cover and significant snow cover can both affect night sky visibility if it s very cloudy or if the ground is significantly covered in snow you may have a hard time seeing celestial bodies in the sky avoid other limiting factors there are many other factors can also affect night sky visibility including some that you might be inflicting upon yourself for example your level of alcohol consumption your nicotine consumption and your pupil dilation at the time of viewing can all affect your ability to see celestial bodies these factors all affect your eyes ability to adjust to the dark and identify stars and planets in the night sky 21 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to find the pleiades star cluster,the pleiades or seven sisters form a beautiful star cluster near the constellation taurus this is one of the nearest star clusters to earth and perhaps the most beautiful to the naked eye over the millennia it has inspired folklore around the world and is now studied as a recent birthplace for new stars 1 x research source,look for the pleiades in autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere the pleiades star cluster becomes visible to evening observers in october and disappears in april november is the best time to look for the pleiades when they are visible from dusk to dawn and reach their highest point in the sky 2 x research source in early october the pleiades become visible a couple hours after sunset by about february the pleiades are already high in the sky at sunset 3 x research source the exact timing depends on your latitude the pleiades are visible in late summer and early autumn as well but only in the middle of the night face the southern sky the pleiades rise in the southeast after dusk and travel west during the night during their peak in november they climb high in the sky and disappear in the northwest before dawn in late winter and early spring they will only be visible for a few hours traveling east to west across the southern part of the sky 4 x research source find orion orion the hunter is one of the most famous and distinct constellations in the sky on a winter evening at a mid northern latitude he stands almost due south about halfway between the horizon and the sky directly above your head 5 x research source locate him by his belt a straight line of three bright stars close together the red star nearby betelgeuse forms his left shoulder from your perspective while the blue giant rigel on the other side of the belt is his right leg 6 x research source follow the line of the belt to aldebaran treat orion s belt as an arrow pointing to your next landmark moving from left to right in the sky at most times and places this will point to the northwest the next bright star you see in this direction is another bright red orange star aldebaran this is the arabic word for follower likely named because it chases the pleiades each night 7 x research source aldebaran is not in a perfect line with the belt don t try to get there with binoculars or you may miss it aldebaran dips below the horizon around march or earlier in extreme northern latitudes 8 x research source if aldebaran isn t visible try to follow orion s belt all the way to pleiades move onward to find the pleiades continue moving your eyes in the same direction usually northwest from orion s belt to aldebaran and beyond fairly near to aldebaran you should see a tight cluster of blue stars these are the pleiades also called the seven sisters or m45 9 x research source most people can only see six stars with the naked eye or even just a hazy clump if light pollution interferes 10 x research source with a clear night and keen dark adjusted eyes you may see more than seven the seven sisters are clustered close together from end to end the cluster is only ⅔ the width of orion s belt 11 x research source this is much less than the length of the big dipper or little dipper star patterns which some novice stargazers confuse with this one use taurus as a guide next time the red star aldebaran described above is also the eye of the constellation taurus the bull the hyades star cluster nearby forms the chin of the bull if you become familiar with this constellation you can find it as a starting point and look for the pleiades nearby 12 x research source taurus may be difficult to see during a bright moon especially near an urban area 13 x research source watch for the pleiades in spring and summer the pleiades are visible from about october to april during the southern hemisphere s spring and summer months face the northern sky during late november the pleiades rise in the northeast around dusk and travel west until dawn as the seasons progress the pleiades start higher in the sky when the stars appear and spend less time in the sky look for a line of bright stars orion is standing on his head in the southern hemisphere so some observers call this constellation a sauce pan instead with orion s sword the handle pointing upward 14 x research source the rim of the saucepan or orion s belt is a trio of bright stars in a straight line this distinct shape is a starting point for locating many constellations this line has the bright red star betelgeuse on one side and the bright blue star rigel on the other follow the line left in the sky to aldebaran use the line as an arrow pointing left across the sky the next bright star in this direction is aldebaran a bright red supergiant this is the eye of the constellation taurus the bull if the sky is clear and the moon is dim you can see the chin of the bull right next to aldebaran formed by the hyades star cluster continue on to the pleiades keep following the same line from orion s belt and you ll run into a fairly dim cluster of blue stars these are the pleiades also called the seven sisters although most people can only see six or fewer and telescopes can see many more the pleiades are an asterism a star pattern much smaller than a constellation if you hold your thumb out at arm s length the cluster is only about twice the width of your thumbnail 15 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to calculate a light year,at first glance you may think that a light year is a measure of time given that it has the word year in it light years are actually a measure of distance that uses light as a standard if you have ever told a friend you are about five minutes away you have also used time as a measure of distance 1 x research source the distances between stars across the universe are very great so astronomers use light years as a larger unit than miles or kilometers to calculate the actual distance of a light year you simply need to multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds in a year,define the light year a light year is a measure of distance equal to how far light travels in one earth year because distances across the universe are so large astronomers use light years without light years discussing the distance between two stars would require the use of large unruly numbers 2 x research source another measure of distance you may come across when learning astronomy is the parsec it is equal to 3 26 light years it is another way to simplify the numbers used to calculate and discuss astronomical distances 3 x research source write the formula for distance using the common physics formula distance equals rate times time or d r x t you can calculate how long a light year is light year speed of light x one year since speed of light is represented by the variable c you can rewrite the equation as d c x t where d is the distance of a light year c is the speed of light and t is time 4 x research source if you want to know the distance of a light year in kilometers you will need to find the speed of light in kilometers per second if you want miles you will need the speed of light in miles per second you need to know the number of seconds in one earth year for this calculation define the speed of light light in a vacuum travels at a velocity of 186 000 miles per second this is the equivalent of 299 792 kilometers per second or 670 616 629 miles per hour 5 x research source here we will use the velocity in miles per second for this calculation we will use the speed of light c equals 186 000 miles per second this can be rewritten in scientific notation as 1 86 x 105 miles per second calculate the number of seconds in a year to find the number of seconds in a year you will do a series of multiplications by conversions units to convert years to seconds you will multiply the number of days in a year times the number of hours in a day times the number of minutes in an hour times the number of seconds in a minute 1 year x 365 days year x 24 hours day x 60 minutes hour x 60 seconds minute 31 536 000 seconds 6 x research source again we can rewrite this large number using scientific notation as 3 154 x 107 plug variables into equation and solve now that you have defined the variables for speed of light and time you can plug them into the equation d c x t and solve for the distance of a light year replace c with 1 86 x 105 miles per second and time with 3 15 x 107 seconds 7 x research source d c x t d 1 86 x 105 x 3 154 x 107 seconds d 5 8 x 1012 or 5 8 trillion miles calculate the distance in kilometers if you wanted to calculate in kilometers simply replace the speed of light with the speed in kilometers per second 3 00 x 105 the time in seconds remains the same because there is no conversion required 8 x

how to spot the north star,over the centuries humans discovered that the north star can function as a guiding point towards the directional north being able to find the north star is a great survival skill but spotting it can also be a fun activity on a clear night,know what to look for ursa major is a constellation that is also called big bear the big dipper or plough the two outermost stars in the cup of the dipper or the blade of the plough are called the pointers because they describe a straight line that points to the north star see figure find the constellation of ursa major the big dipper is comprised of seven stars that are very recognizable in the night sky 1 x research source the seven stars compose a shape that looks like a cup with a handle to make it easier to find ursa major try using a constellation map if one is available you can also download a constellation finding app on your devices like skyview 2 x research source for apple devices or skymap 3 x research source for androids also try looking on a clear night the absence of clouds will make it easier to spot the star groupings understand that the big dipper changes positions in the sky ursa major rotates in the sky so its position depends on the time of your at which you are viewing it it always rotates around the north star 4 x research source so sometimes the cup is facing up while other times the cup faces down or to the side remember that the big dipper is a fixture of the northern hemisphere s sky so you will only be able to see it and follow these guidelines if you are in the northern hemisphere here are some seasonal guidelines for finding the big dipper based on its location at midnight 5 x research source in the spring the big dipper is located to the north of the north star polaris with the cup facing downward in the summer the big dipper is located just west of polaris with the cup facing to the right in the fall the big dipper is situated to the south of polaris with the cup facing upright in the winter the big dipper can be found to the east of polaris with the cup facing towards the left know your latitude latitude is the position north or south of the equator the height of the north star above the horizon is equal to the latitude of the observer it cannot be seen by an observer on or below the equator although as a practical matter it will be too close to the horizon to be observed south of 10 degrees of north latitude for reference here are some latitudinal measurements of some major locations in the northern hemisphere the north pole has a latitude of 90 degrees north 6 x research source reykjavik iceland has a latitude of 70 degrees north juneau alaska and edinburgh scotland have a latitude of 60 degrees north seattle washington new york city and venice italy have a latitude of 50 degrees north denver colorado and seoul south korea have a latitude of 40 degrees north new orleans louisiana and orlando florida have a latitude of 30 degrees north mexico city mexico and kingston jamaica have a latitude of 20 degrees north san jose costa rica and panama city panama have a latitude of 10 degrees north if you have access to the internet you can use a latitude finder online to determine your latitude like the one offered by nasa if you don t know your latitude and you don t have access to the internet you can determine your latitude by looking at the sun at noon 7 x research source put one flat board or stick in the ground pointing upwards so that it is perfectly perpendicular with the ground use another flat board on the top making a t with the two boards but tilt the top board toward the sun the angle of the shadow cast by the sun will be the degree of your latitude note that these readings are only accurate on march 21st and september 21st the spring and fall equinoxes in the winter specifically december 21st you should subtract 23 45 degrees from your reading and in the summer specifically june 21st you should add 23 45 degrees these variations in measurement exist because of the way the earth is tilted when it orbits the sun if you know your location in terms of degrees of latitude face north and look for a moderately bright star that many degrees above the horizon a fist held out at arm s length represents approximately 10 degrees in the sky and can be used to measure the height above the horizon 8 x research source spot the north star in the night sky the two outer most stars in the cup of the big dipper the two farthest from the handle are the keys to finding the north star draw an imaginary line straight through these two stars toward the little dipper this will lead you to the handle of the little dipper the brightest star at the end of the handle of the little dipper is the north star 9 x research source the north star polaris or sometimes dhruva tara fixed star taivaanneula heaven s needle or lodestar is a second magnitude multiple star about 430 light years from earth because it is very close to the north celestial pole it appears stationary over the northern horizon 10 x research source find cassiopeia the constellation of cassiopeia which looks like a big w is always opposite ursa major the north star is located approximately midway between the central star of cassiopeia and the third star in the handle of the big dipper 11 x research source this trick is especially helpful in the fall when it is harder to see the big dipper 12 x research source trust the north star the north star is more reliable than a compass which can be affected by environmental factors and periodic variations if you can find north by locating the north star and your compass tells you something different follow the direction the north star leads you 13 x research source determine latitude from the north star s location in the sky where the north star appears in the sky depends on your latitude at the north pole the north star appears directly overhead but at the equator it would appear on the horizon both corresponding to the latitudes of the location 14 x research source if you use the fist method and count how many fists the north star appears over the horizon that will give you your latitude remember that a fist counts as approximately 10 degrees for latitude figure out where you want to go use the north star to guide you in a direction or at the very least to keep you from going in circles if you are lost think about where you are and which direction would be the most helpful especially if you are lost in the wilderness and need to get back to civilization once you have found the north star facing it will point you due north if you face directly away from it you ll be facing due south 15 x research source when you are facing the north star stretch your arms out to your sides your left hand will be pointing due west and your right hand will be pointing due east 16 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the north star,the north star also known as polaris is often used by campers to help them find their way when lost you may also just want to find the north star for fun if you re into star gazing you can rely on constellations in the night sky to find the north star as most constellations you ll need to use are in the northern sky you ll need to figure out which direction is north first if you do not have a compass you can rely on signs from nature to figure out whether or not you re facing north,use the pointer stars of the big dipper you can easily locate the north star by using the big dipper the big dipper contains stars known as pointer stars which can be used to locate the north star 1 x research source to start locate the big dipper the big dipper is a constellation made up of seven stars the constellation is found in the northern sky in the spring and summer months the big dipper will be somewhat high in the sky in the autumn and winter months it ll be lower in the sky 2 x research source the big dipper is given its name because it s shaped somewhat like a bowl with a handle four stars form a trapezoid like shape the bowl portion stemming off of these four stars are three more stars forming the shape of a slightly bent handle 3 x research source once you ve located the big dipper you can use it to find the north star to do so look at the two bright stars that form the side of the bowl farthest away from the handle s tip these are the pointer stars draw an imaginary line connecting the pointer stars extend that line five times the distance between the pointer stars you should eventually reach a somewhat bright star this is the north star note that you do not actually have to see the north star with this method if clouds or trees or mountains are in the way the north star is still there near the end of the fifth pointer length that point is less than three degrees from the north star and the north celestial pole 4 x research source locate the tip of the little dipper s handle the little dipper is the constellation that contains the north star the tip of the little dipper s handle is the north star if you re able to locate the little dipper you can easily spot the north star 5 x research source you can use the big dipper to find the little dipper once you find the big dipper look away from it as if water was coming out of the open part of the dipper the little dipper will appear as a mirror image of the big dipper it is also a constellation made up of seven stars four stars form a trapezoid base and three extend out from this base to form a handle the last star extending outward is the north star 6 x research source if you live in an urban area it can be difficult to locate the little dipper it is also difficult to discern on bright moonlit or hazy nights you may be better off trying another method 7 x research source rely on the arrow in the cassiopeia constellation using the big or little dipper are the most common means to locate the north star however if the big dipper is low in the sky it can be difficult fortunately you can use the constellation cassiopeia to locate the north star cassiopeia is a constellation that consists of five stars they form an m or w shape cassiopeia is located in the north sky in earlier hours the constellation looks more like an m between midnight and dawn the constellation looks more like a w in the months of february and march cassiopeia is especially likely to appear as a w 8 x research source the three stars that form the middle portion of the m or w can be used to roughly locate the north star look at this point as if it were an arrow follow the direction of the arrow forward you should eventually land on a somewhat bright star this is the north star note that you will have to actually see the north star for this method to work 9 x research source locate the north star with your smart phone there are many smart phone applications that work something like a telescope you enter your location or allow the phone to find your location and then point your phone to the sky the phone acts as interactive map identifying stars and constellations for you some applications can also enhance visuals allowing you to see stars more easily sky guide is an application for iphones the app can track your location and time then you can hold your phone up to the sky and it will provide you a map it can identify different constellations and stars 10 x research source for an android there is an app known as stellarium mobile it works the same as skyguide but with a slightly higher resolution you can better see stars and constellations through your phone when using stellarium 11 x research source invest in a star atlas star atlases have been around for a long time if the idea of carrying your phone around while stargazing kills the fun for you consider buying a star atlas instead you should also always take an atlas with you when hiking in the event your phone battery dies a star atlas is a book that breaks down the night sky by the region and time of year you can use the graphics and charts provided in a star atlas to locate the north star on any given night every star atlas is slightly different there s usually a guide in back that provides information on how constellations are labeled for example small stars may be labeled by dots major stars like the north star may be marked by large red dots 12 x research source a star atlas will provide a map much like a map of a town or city guiding you across the night sky on any given night select the map for your specific region and time of year and use that map as a guide bring a flashlight with you as you go out to stargaze so you can consult the map as needed 13 x research source practice using the star atlas before you go camping it can take a while to get proficient at using a star atlas make sure you get lots of practice so if you need to find the north star in a pinch you re well prepared to use your atlas 14 x research source of course where a star atlas really proves its worth is if it makes you familiar enough with the night sky that you don t need the atlas learn the characteristics and locations of the big dipper cassiopeia orion leo pegasus and crux be able to find directions when the need arises unexpectedly and you re without your compass or gps or atlas plan ahead with your computer you can use desktop applications for your computer to know how the sky will look on a given night these devices can help you plan ahead you ll go outside with a rough idea of where you can expect to find the north star in addition to phone applications stellarium also provides a desktop application you can download on your computer to locate the north star it s available for linux mac and windows your background would be the night sky adjusted for your region and time of year it will show you what you can expect the night sky to resemble on a given night locating the north star for you you ll know where in the sky to look when you go out 15 x research source if you have a mac photopills is a photography planning application you can use this if you re planning on photographing the night sky based on your location and the time of year photopills will simulate the galactic arch for you this will form a map you can use later to locate the north star 16 x research source figure out which direction is north using two sticks if you don t know what direction you re facing finding constellations can be a struggle this can inhibit your ability to locate the north star determining which direction is north can allow you to locate the north star more easily you can use two sticks to do so first find two sticks one stick should be slightly bigger than the other 17 x research source place the sticks in the ground vertically place the taller stick slightly ahead of the shorter one 18 x research source lie down in front of the sticks line up one eye forming a straight line between your eye and the two sticks wait for a star to appear in your line of vision 19 x research source stare at the star for a few minutes and wait for it to move it if it moves up you re facing east if it moves down you re facing west if it moves right you re facing south it if moves left you re facing north 20 x research source create a shadow with sticks if it s daytime you may still be able to see the north star however you ll be unable to rely on constellations as they re very difficult to see during the day instead you can create a shadow with sticks and use that to locate north place a stick in the ground take a stone or other object and place it where the end of the stick s shadow falls 21 x research source wait about an hour the shadow will move either growing shorter or longer place another stick at the end of the new shadow then stand at a perpendicular angle to the shadow you are now facing north 22 x research source pay attention to how moss is growing if you re in an area where moss grows you can use moss to help you locate north look for moss on vertical structures such as trees moss requires a damp atmosphere to grow this means moss usually grows on the north side of vertical structures as the north side gets less sun 23 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to navigate by the stars,before the gps before the compass your main means of finding your way was to navigate by the stars although today s technology makes finding your way easier it s still fun to learn how to navigate by the stars you can find north south east or west by learning a few stars and constellations or you can simply pick out a star and follow its movements,look for polaris the north star polaris is the brightest star in the constellation ursa minor the little bear it can be found in the bear s tail the ancient greeks and many other peoples saw bears as having long tails the star is called polaris because it appears within a degree of the celestial north pole and so appears not to move in the night sky 1 x research source 2 x research source today because the seven stars of ursa minor look like a small water dipper most people refer to ursa minor as the little dipper instead of the little bear use pointer stars to help you find the north star although polaris is visible in the northern sky at most locations north of the equator it can be hard to spot if you don t know exactly what you re looking for you can use stars in other constellations to point the way to polaris the most commonly used pointer stars are merak and dubhe the two stars on the edge of the big dipper opposite its handle by following these stars in the direction of the big dipper s mouth you can find polaris if you go five times the merak dubhe distance away from dubhe you will be within three degrees of polaris if polaris is clouded over you still know where it is during the times of night when the big dipper is below the horizon such as the early hours of fall you can use another method find the great square of pegasus measure the distance from alpheratz visually a part of pegasus but actually part of the constellation andromeda to caph the star at the rightmost edge of the w shaped constellation cassiopeia in line with alpheratz and caph measure another of these distances you will be less than three degrees from polaris and like the previous method you do not need to see polaris 3 x research source star identification naval air training command navigation section january 1951 locate polaris use either of the pointer star methods to help you determine the angle in degrees between polaris position and the northern horizon the most accurate way to do this is with a quadrant or sextant which lets you read the angle off its curved section this angle measure is the same as your latitude north of the equator if you don t have a quadrant or sextant you can approximate the angle by extending your fist to the horizon and stacking fists hand over hand until you reach the north star your extended fist is approximately 10 degrees of angle measure 4 x research source look for the constellation orion the constellation orion the hunter bears a resemblance to a bent hourglass the stars betelgeuse and bellatrix represent its shoulders the stars saiph and rigel represent its knees or feet the three stars in the middle alnitak alnilam and mintaka represent orion s belt in the northern hemisphere orion is visible chiefly in the winter and early spring but can be seen late at night in the fall or before sunrise in the summer find orion s sword if you can look for one moderately bright one dim and one fuzzy star hanging down from alnilam the middle star in orion s belt this represents orion s sword which points to the south 5 x research source the fuzzy star is actually the great nebula of orion an interstellar nursery where new stars are being formed 6 x research source look for crux the southern cross while there is a star near the south celestial pole sigma octantis it s too dim to do you much good for finding south 7 x research source instead look for the bright constellation crux the southern cross which consists of four stars that form the ends of the cross upright and crosspiece 8 x research source the southern cross is so important a constellation that it is depicted on the flags of australia and new zealand however it not particularly large it is only one degree longer than the distance between the pointer stars in the big dipper that s what makes the pointer stars rigel kentaurus and hadar so important they keep you from locking in on the false cross which is nearby and just a little bigger extend a line through the long axis of the cross the point along this line about four and a half times the length of the long axis is directly above south 9 x research source optionally improve your accuracy by finding the two pointers to the southern cross and drawing a line through them then take a line perpendicular from the middle of that and extend it to intersect with the line drawn from the southern cross where they intersect is directly above south drawing a line through the two stars of the crosspiece will point you to the star alpha centauri the closest star to earth after the sun 10 x research source star identification naval air training command navigation section january 1951 look for the constellation orion as noted before the torso of the constellation looks something like a bent hourglass then look for the rightmost star in orion s belt this star mintaka rises and sets within a degree of true east or west 11 x research source drive 2 stakes in the ground the stakes should be about 1 yard 91 cm apart pick any star you see in the night sky you can use any star for this although you ll probably want to pick one of the brighter stars line the star up with the tops of both stakes wait for the star to move out of position with the stakes earth s rotation from west to east causes the stars in the sky as a whole to rotate from east to west which way the star has moved with respect to its original position where you sighted it tells you which direction you re facing if the star rose you re facing east if the star sank you re facing west if the star moved to the left you re facing north if the star moved to the right you re facing south 12 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find the orion nebula,the orion nebula also known as m42 is a beautiful deep sky object in the constellation orion while most nebulae clouds of interstellar gas and dust are difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye m42 is quite easy to spot in the night sky for much of the year with a little guidance you ll be able to spot the orion nebula with your eyes binoculars or your telescope,wait for the right time of year because of the slow orbit of the earth around the sun the nebula is not visible all year round the nebula is visible from late autumn to early spring 1 x research source the constellation orion which contains the orion nebula is highest in the sky around midnight in mid december 2 x research source look in the right part of the sky for the nebula due to the spherical nature of the earth the direction the nebula will appear in is relative to your position on our planet in the northern hemisphere look to the southwest in the southern hemisphere look to the northwest 3 x research source identify the best latitude to see the orion nebula from the nebula is best seen from latitudes of 85 and 75 degrees in other words if you re hanging out with polar bears in the north pole or penguins in the south pole you won t be seeing the orion nebula 4 x research source you can identify what hemisphere you re in by looking at a map if the country you re in lies south of the equator you re in the southern hemisphere if the country you re in lies north of the equator you re in the northern hemisphere find the belt of orion the belt of orion is one of the most recognizable asterisms a group of stars in an identifiable cluster it is composed of three very bright stars alnitak alnilam and mintaka in a line relatively equidistant from one another the belt and the orion nebula both lie within the constellation orion so knowing where the belt is will help you know you re in the neighborhood of the nebula find betelgeuse and rigel if you imagine the belt of orion as perfectly parallel to your line of sight and thus forming a vertical line betelgeuse and rigel are two stars which sit on either side of the belt the path from betelgeuse through alnilam the middle star in the belt and on to rigel forms an almost straight line rigel and betelgeuse are about equidistant from alnilam betelgeuse is a red supergiant and true to its name glows a dull red orange it is located up and to the left of the belt of orion if you re in the northern hemisphere and down and to the right of the belt if you re in the southern hemisphere 5 x research source rigel is a blue white star located down and to the right of the belt of orion if you re in the northern hemisphere and up and to the left if you re in the southern hemisphere 6 x research source identify the orion nebula the orion nebula is located just to one side of the line between rigel and alnilam the middle star in the belt of orion the nebula is a faint fuzzy blue patch in the sword of orion an asterism composed of iota orionis just below the orion nebula if viewed from the northern hemisphere the orion nebula and ngc 1981 an open star cluster visible just below the orion nebula if viewed from the northern hemisphere 7 x research source orient yourself to the chart s directions in other words hold your star chart in such a way that the compass directions are aligned in the same way your body is if for instance you re facing south as you should to see m42 hold the star chart in such a way that the southern edge of the chart is at the bottom and the northern edge is at the top ensure your star chart is for the current season identify nearby stars and constellations unless you have an exquisitely detailed star chart the orion nebula will not be explicitly labeled though it should appear as a point on the chart however using the star chart to locate nearby objects in the night sky will help you find it the orion nebula is located just to one side of the line between alnilam the middle star in the belt of orion and rigel in the constellation orion these and other major features of the night sky will provide relative guide you to where you can locate it there are several major stars and constellations around m42 which can help you locate it the belt of orion is one such constellation locating it with your star chart should be easy the constellation orion is a major constellation and lends the orion nebula its name orion is located at the intersection of taurus lepus and gemini lift the star chart above your head your star chart will mirror the appearance of the night sky think of it as an astronomical map with the chart in an overhead position you can easily identify the various stellar objects in your quadrant of the sky find the stellar objects you identified as near to m42 then use their relative positioning to find it if your star chart does have a label for m42 your job is much easier use it to locate the nebula identify the nebula s right ascension the right ascension of a celestial object is the astronomical equivalent of longitude and measures the distance eastward from the celestial equator towards the vernal equinox the point at which the celestial equator and ecliptic intersect during spring in the northern hemisphere 8 x research source the orion nebula s right ascension is 5 hours 9 x research source in other words the nebula will cross the celestial meridian the point directly above you or an observer five hours after the vernal equinox identify the nebula s declination declination is an astronomical equivalent to latitude and provides guidance toward a point on the celestial sphere the visible sphere of stars and astronomical objects surrounding the earth declination is measured relative to the celestial equator the line you d get if the equator were projected out into space the orion nebula s declination is five degrees 10 x research source in other words it lies along a plane five degrees above the celestial equator set your telescope to locate the nebula first you ll need to adjust the placement of your telescope so that it is in station parallel to the axis of the earth a telescope in station would trace a direct line to the equator if the earth were flat use your setting circle to find the nebula you can designate the declination and right ascension mechanically or on a newer scope digitally 11 x research source look through the eyepiece to see m42,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to get started in amateur astronomy,when you look up at the darkened sky and gaze at the stars some seem to be blinking and you wonder why all of a sudden you can see a shooting star and the little dipper the moon is in an eclipse and a feeling of wonder overcomes you there is so much up there to learn about and enjoy and it is not difficult or expensive to become involved,read about astronomy merely looking up in the sky will not teach you all you need to know so visit your local library and browse through the astronomy section there are a variety of books which are geared toward beginners as well as the more advanced find one that is an introduction to astronomy and learn about the physics of the cosmos surf the internet under astronomy and be assured you will receive a vast array of information as well as pictures visit a planetarium or observatory many observatories have huge expensive telescopes and offer you an exciting as well as informative way of observing the many wonders of the sky check with your local science museum to see if they offer a star gazing night open to the public visit the observatory at night climb up to the tower and observe first hand through their powerful telescopes what you have learned and seen up until now only in books a planetarium uses projectors to offer an artificial view of the night sky the chairs recline the room becomes black and all you see are stars in a darkened sky this is a great way to get started because you will have access to an expert guide to answer your questions you also will get to meet others with similar interests purchase a star atlas or a star map which will enable you to determine what you are looking at while gazing at the sky your library will probably have one but since maps will be an important part of your astronomical study it is best to buy your own if you are unable to afford one then download free star maps from the internet find someplace dark to observe that is away from city glare good choices might include national and state parks inquire at these places about naturalist lead presentations about the night sky as well use your eyes it is not necessary to buy an expensive telescope because the naked eye can see a great deal in the night sky by observing with only your eyes you get a true feeling of how ancient astronomers practiced their craft if you can try to lie down on the grass and look at the sky above you the darkened sky takes on another dimension in this position and creates a feeling of you being totally alone in a vast universe locate the north star and follow the map of the sky make sure you have the correct star map to coincide with the date and location if you have studied the books you might be able to find the little dipper and other constellations or asterisms buy a pair of binoculars if your naked eye observations have gotten you excited about astronomy get a good set of binoculars and observe the night sky with them for a more close up view 10x50 binoculars are excellent for stargazing obtain a telescope there are several types of telescopes with different features uses and prices however you need not purchase the most expensive one in order to enjoy astronomy the most important thing to consider is the telescope s aperture or the size of the light gathering part of the telescope the larger the aperture the brighter your image will be the next most important characteristic is the focal length of the scope which will determine how much of the sky you can see in the image magnification is much less important than quality of optics a good way to choose a telescope is to attend star parties see below and ask a few of the members for permission to try theirs so you get an idea of which models you prefer join an astronomy club amateur astronomy is very popular in most cities and small towns search the internet to find a club in your vicinity or get information by calling a local planetarium for clubs in the u s a go to http www nightskynetwork org a website dedicated to amateur astronomy which will help you locate clubs and events clubs give you the opportunity to learn from others who have more experience and to meet and make new friends with other beginners who have the same interest in astronomy attend a star party star parties are outdoor meetings where amateur astronomers meet and look at the sky together many are already members of an astronomy club this can be quite interesting especially since each person might find a new area star or planet that you might have overlooked subscribe to an astronomy magazine there are a number of periodicals which cater to amateur astronomers among the most popular are sky and telescope and astronomy these magazines provide monthly calendars a wealth of sky watching tips amazing pictures and up to date information on new products and discoveries subscribe to an astronomy podcast such as what s up in astronomy stardate or skywatch they are free and you can search for them in itunes and many other podcast directories join the astronomical league or similar organization membership in these large astronomy organizations will give you the opportunity to network with other astronomers and to participate in observing programs the astronomical league has observing programs for every age skill and equipment level and by participating in a program and submitting your observation log you can earn certificates of completion and a wealth of new knowledge enjoy your new hobby amateur astronomy can be a lifelong pursuit and there s always

how to find your way around the summer night sky,for those who live in the northern hemisphere the summer nights are simply dazzling filled with hundreds indeed thousands of stars while it may seem daunting at first you can learn the major constellations of summer and find your way around the night sky by using the steps below as a guide,look for three bright stars the chart below represents a typical summer night in this case july 14th at 9pm local 10pm local dst at roughly 35 north close to the latitude for the cities of memphis tennessee usa tokyo japan and tehran iran looking straight up facing south you ll notice three bright stars to your left the east these stars are vega altair and deneb they form a large asterism known as the summer triangle 1 x research source go for the three constellations after locating the summer triangle you can identify the three constellations associated with those stars lyra the harp aquila the eagle and cygnus the swan 2 x research source spot an orange star to your right the west and a little further north you will find the big dipper also known as the plough the plough is actually another asterism follow the curve of the handle south towards a very bright star arc to arcturus the brilliant orange star that marks the constellation boötes the herdsman locate another bright constellation this one is perhaps the best looking summer constellation scorpius the scorpion which lies due south the brightest star in scorpius is antares a red giant 3 x research source use the brighter constellations to locate some of the fainter constellations draw an invisible line from deneb through vega and a little further west this will lead you to the constellation hercules the hero move west and back to the bright star arcturus since you have already followed the arc to arcturus you can now spike to spica which is the brightest star in the constellation virgo the maiden 4 x research source look for the teapot moving back to the south and scorpius locate the teapot asterism it is made up of the brightest members of the constellation sagittarius the archer an interesting fact the area just above the spout and between scorpius marks the direction of the center of the milky way our galactic home find the big bear move back north now the big dipper the plough mentioned before as an asterism is actually part of a large constellation known as ursa major the big bear if you follow an invisible line from the two stars opposite the handle the pointers you ll find that they point almost directly towards polaris the north star which is at the end of the handle of the little dipper another asterism this is actually ursa minor the little bear 5 x research source go for cassiopeia the queen if you continue to follow the line through polaris you will come to a constellation that lies almost directly opposite the sky of ursa major this is cassiopeia the queen one of the major autumn constellations 6 x research source locate one of the smallest of the 88 official constellations just to the east of the summer triangle this is delphinus the dolphin which truly looks like its namesake,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find a meteorite,the solar system is full of meteors these meteors fly around the solar system and sometimes collide into other celestial bodies including the earth some meteors burn up in the atmosphere and never make it to the surface of the earth but some do once a meteor lands on the earth s surface it is classified as a meteorite if you are interested in owning one of these space treasures you can go out and find them you just need to know where to look how to pinpoint a meteorite and how to tell them apart from other rocks,look through a database scientists and meteorite enthusiasts keep up to date records of where they find meteorites you can look online for databases such as the meteoritical society s database that show the areas that produce the most meteorite discoveries pinpointing the nearest hot spot for meteorites is a great start to finding your own choose a warm arid climate moisture and damp climates will deteriorate a meteorite relatively quickly your best shot at finding an intact meteorite is to look in a place that stays hot and dry deserts are one of the best climates to search dried up lake beds are great too 1 x research source for example more meteorites have been found in the sahara than any other place on earth get permission to search the area before you take off scouring the earth in search of meteorites take a moment to think about who owns the land you are searching if the land is owned privately you will need the owner s permission before searching it public lands follow different rules depending on the particular jurisdiction but you always need permission to search any public lands 2 x research source if it is privately owned land you need to ask the landowner for permission to be on the property if the land is publicly owned e g a park you need permission from the governing body to search it and permission to keep the meteorite if you find it some areas classify them as artifacts meaning that they belong to the municipality rather than the discoverer buy or make a meteorite stick while the name might suggest something exotic a meteorite stick is a simple stick with a magnet at the end of it you can stick the end to rocks on the ground to test for magnetic properties if a rock has magnetic properties then there s a chance that it could be a meteorite and warrants further investigation using a long stick will prevent you from continually bending over to see if individual rocks are magnetic get a good metal detector you should get a metal detector that is made to search for gold these are the most accurate metal detectors go to the location that you intend to search and run the coil of the metal detector along the ground to scan for meteorites underneath the surface 3 x research source good used metal detectors generally cost between 250 and 400 there is no need to buy a new one for a higher price the metal detector is more sensitive than a meteorite stick but less convenient to use you should keep both with you bring a gps a gps will serve you in two ways first it will help you keep track of your position in case you get lost second it allows you to mark the location of any meteorites that you find if you do find a meteorite marking its location is important this allows you to upload it to the meteorite databases and help map the location of meteorites be prepared to dig sometimes you can find meteorites just lying on the ground other times your metal detector will pick up a signal from something deep in the ground bring along a pickaxe and a spade to help you dig up any potential meteorites test the rock for magnetic properties testing the rock for magnetic properties can be done rather quickly just hold a magnet near the rock to determine if there is any interaction this can even be done with the magnet at the tip of your meteorite stick most meteorites have magnetic properties keep in mind that some terrestrial rocks also have magnetic properties observe the density of the rock because of their high iron and nickel content meteorites are rather dense they are often denser than most terrestrial rocks this can be loosely translated to being heavier than other rocks their size pick up the rock and analyze how heavy it feels versus what you would expect a rock that size to feel like look for common meteorite traits while not all meteorites share the same characteristics there are some common traits that can be found in most of them if you can identify one or more of these traits there s a good chance that you have a found a meteorite four specific traits to look for are a metallic shine on the surface of the rock small rounded pieces of stones on the surface these are known as chondrules a black or brown coating known as fusion crust this is produced by the extreme heat of flying through the atmosphere small dents covering the surface of the rock this is regmaglypt texture or thumbprints do a streak test try dragging the rock in question across a streak plate or a piece of paper if it leaves a streak it is probably a terrestrial rock if it doesn t leave a streak or if the streak is weak and gray in color it might be a meteorite a streak plate is generally made of unglazed ceramic 4 x research source you can find them online or in rock mineral testing kits,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to stargaze comfortably,stargazing can be a rewarding and engaging activity when done right knowing when where and how to stargaze is key to a comfortable experience so the next time the night sky is clear and you want to go out stargazing for an hour or more gather your comfortable clothing and blankets and lay back and enjoy,layer your clothing depending on the time of year you ll need to bring a variety of clothing with you as your body temperature will drop the longer you sit still likewise you might get warm and want to shed a few layers if you stargaze in the fall or winter try thermal underwear sweaters hats gloves or mittens and scarves if you stargaze in the spring or summer wear multiple light layers try a zip up hoodie light jacket hat and jeans bring one warm coat in case the temperature drops dramatically during the night bring a mat chair and pillow you will want to keep your eyes trained on the sky for an extended period of time so comfort is a must your neck will become tired and sore very quickly unless you lay flat on your back or recline in a chair good options for comfort and warmth are a yoga mat pillows tarp in case of dew or damp grass camping pad camping chair or reclining deck chair 1 x research source if prefer to sit up remember to put something between yourself and the ground so that you don t catch a chill use a blanket for comfort and warmth bringing a blanket or two will both keep you warm and add a layer of cushioning to your chair mat or tarp sit under or on top of a blanket or bundle it under your head for extra support don t bring blankets that are not washable anything you bring with you while stargazing may get dirty or wet since you will be outdoors pack food and drinks you may be out for a while so it s important to supply yourself with snacks and beverages sustenance can be both fun and practical so remember to pack things that you like popular beverage options are hot chocolate coffee tea especially during the colder months water soda and beer or wine if you are over 21 and have a designated driver portable energy filled foods you might want to bring are trail mix granola bars chocolate beef jerky soup in a thermos or pre made sandwiches relax your eyes by bringing binoculars binoculars will help you see more stars planets and constellations than you would with your naked eye this way you won t strain your eyes trying to see everything that s up there 2 x research source try a tent or canopy for longer stargazing trips if you think you ll be out stargazing for a while or are worried about the weather bring a tent canopy or tarp that you can set up this way you ll have shelter from the elements and can take a rest if you re feeling tired or worn out you can also store your extra snacks drinks chairs and blankets underneath the covering 3 x research source stargaze on a dry clear night this way you ll see more stars and you won t get wet from rain or overly hot due to humidity 4 x research source a breeze can mean less pollution near a city but strong wind can be chilly so bring extra blankets and sweaters if it seems windy 5 x research source stargaze in the summertime summer nights during june july and august can offer great stargazing conditions you ll also be more comfortable than you would be in the winter and can pack a bit lighter 6 x research source you are most likely to see meteor showers in the summertime the perseids meteor shower is awe inspiring and visible from nearly everywhere in the northern hemisphere it occurs every august 7 x research source some constellations that can be seen year round meaning they are circumpolar are cassiopeia ursa major and cepheus 8 x research source get out of the city for the most relaxation try to avoid major cities and densely populated areas stargazing will be difficult in these areas because of the light pollution and noise they produce for a relaxed stargazing experience you ll want to find some peace and quiet likely in a more rural area 9 x research source watch out for wildlife if you are able to find a sparsely populated rural area to stargaze in chances are good that some wildlife will be around deer bears coyotes raccoons and possums are common camp crashers research what animals are found in your area and keep a sharp eye out while you are outside at night 10 x research source wherever you decide to stargaze always bring bug spray you certainly won t be comfortable if you re swatting at mosquitos all night you can bring a bright floodlight or something to make loud noises with to deter animals that may come near while you are stargazing bring a friend or family member along this is a good safety precaution in case you lose your way in the dark or are nervous about being alone at night you are also likely to spot more stars with two sets of eyes set up on level ground arrange your tent chairs blankets snacks and drinks on an even surface and make sure that everything is within arm s reach of you this way you won t have to fumble around too much and you won t risk losing anything in the dark remember to clean up after yourself both to avoid animal encounters and to protect the environment position your head at a 30 degree angle to the ground this way you won t strain your neck as you look up at the stars and you will mimic the comfort of lying in bed do this by using a pillow re positioning your reclining chair or bundling a blanket beneath your head you can also try lying completely flat on the ground for a fuller view of the sky some people find this posture slightly harder to get up from however use an infra red flashlight to relax your eyes you will need to turn off your regular light once you have set up your area in order to stargaze 11 x research source but if you need to look around after doing so you should use an infra red light to avoid having to re adjust your eyes to the darkness a red light is easier on the eyes and will not disturb your stargazing environment your eyes will need anywhere from five to thirty minutes to adjust to the darkness and turning a bright white light off and on will deter this adjustment process you can cover your regular flashlight with red cellophane rather than buying an infra red light 12 x research source put less strain on your eyes try using the averted vision method of seeing stars and constellations which may be useful if you find it hard to spot faint stars rather than straining your eyes look just to the side of what you re trying to see your peripheral vision is more sensitive to light and dark making it easier to see faint objects when the rest of the sky appears gray 13 x research source enjoy yourself stargazing can be a fun rewarding experience whether you are an amateur or expert stargazer lay back have a snack talk to a friend and observe the night sky as you wouldn t normally be able to,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to go to space,fewer than 600 people have been to space and most of them have been professional astronauts however thanks to advances in technology commercial space travel is seeming more and more likely every year at this time reserving a spot on a commercial spacecraft is incredibly expensive but the costs may go down in the coming years as space travel becomes easier and more accessible alternatively you can try to become an astronaut through your government s space agency in order to go to space even if visiting space isn t a possibility for you at the moment there are still ways you can experience space right here on earth,consider whether you have the financial means to travel to space commercially because commercial space travel is such a new industry and there are only a few companies planning to offer space tourism in the foreseeable future the price for a ticket on a commercial spacecraft can be incredibly expensive ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of usd also since no companies are sending tourists to space at this time you ll likely be paying a large sum of money to reserve a seat for a future unconfirmed date 1 x research source if money isn t an issue for you reserving a seat on a future commercial spaceflight may be one of your best chances to travel to space look for companies that are currently testing commercial spacecraft companies like virgin galactic and spacex are testing a variety of commercial spacecraft that could transport tourists into space where they d experience weightlessness and get the chance to see earth out of their windows while there isn t a set date for when these spacecraft will be open to the public some companies are claiming that they ll be able to start commercial operations within a few years depending on the company you might be able to reserve a spot in advance 2 x research source other companies that are working on commercial space travel that you can look into include blue origin founded by amazon ceo jeff bezos space adventures and xcor aerospace stay up to date on the space industry to learn about any breakthroughs you can learn about advances in the industry by following companies on social media reading space related blogs and websites and reading the news that way you ll know if any new commercial space flights become available or if a company you re interested in gets one step closer to launching a commercial flight for updates on commercial space travel check out websites like https www space com https www nasa gov and http www esa int esa you can also follow companies like virgin galactic and spacex on social media to get updates wait for space tourism to become more affordable if you can t get a ticket yet as the space tourism industry becomes more practical and accessible the cost of space travel should drop if traveling to space commercially isn t an option for you right now don t get discouraged as technology continues to advance you may start to see more affordable options for traveling to space 3 x research source make sure you live in a country with a space agency that travels to space not all countries have a space agency and some countries that do have a space agency don t actually send astronauts to space in order to become an astronaut you ll need to be a citizen of a country that actually sends people into space if you re really passionate about becoming an astronaut but your country doesn t have a space agency that needs them you could always become a citizen of a country that does have a space agency that sends astronauts to space like the u s or a country within the european union do well in school and get a degree to meet the educational requirements governments are looking for smart hardworking candidates for their space programs so it s important that you start getting good grades in school as early as possible also you should plan on getting an undergraduate degree in something like math science or engineering if you don t already have one since most space agencies will require one 4 x research source for example nasa requires astronauts to have a bachelor s degree in engineering biological sciences physical science computer science or mathematics eat healthy and exercise regularly so you re physically fit being an astronaut is a physically demanding job and you ll be expected to pass physical exams and training in order to be considered to make sure you up for it adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating healthy foods and getting in routine exercise each week 5 x research source to eat healthy focus on eating a variety of healthy foods like fruits vegetables whole grains and low fat dairy products you should also make sure you re eating plenty of protein complex carbohydrates and healthy fats 6 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source to exercise aim to get in around 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise like walking running and playing sports once a week as well as strength training exercise twice a week 7 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source in addition to being physically fit there may be other physical requirements like having 20 20 vision or falling within a certain height range cultivate the right personality traits for the job in addition to being physically fit astronaut candidates are required to have certain personality traits that are useful on a mission to space while these traits may vary depending on your space agency s requirements in general you should work on being flexible good at working with a team and able to function well under pressure you should also love to learn new things 8 x research source if you re still in school joining academic clubs can be a great way to develop good interpersonal skills and a passion for learning to become more flexible and able to adapt to change try new things and put yourself out there as much as possible even if you re a little nervous exposing yourself to new situations is a great way to develop the skills you need to be flexible 9 x research source gain some relevant professional experience the exact amount of professional experience you ll need to become an astronaut will depend on your space agency but generally you ll be required to work in a related field like engineering computer science or mathematics for a few years before you can be considered for the job after you complete school try to find work doing something that s related to your degree which will help you meet the experience requirements and also better prepare you for being an astronaut 10 x research source for example nasa requires 3 years of professional experience or 1 000 hours of pilot in command time spent flying a jet aircraft 11 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source depending on your space agency s requirements you may be able to supplement this professional experience with an advanced degree like a master s or doctorate 12 x research source apply to be an astronaut through your government s space agency the right way to submit an application will depend on your space agency s application process try visiting their website or searching something like nasa astronaut application online to find a list of instructions and requirements after you submit your application you ll likely be required to undergo a variety of interviews tests and physical exams to determine if you re qualified for the job 13 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source keep in mind that the application process for becoming an astronaut is highly competitive for example in 2016 nasa received over 18 000 applications and only 120 of those applicants were called

how to stargaze,if you ve ever been drawn to the beauty of the night sky you may have thought about spending an evening just staring at the stars and trying to learn about them while all you truly need to stargaze is a view of the night sky you can get even more out of the experience by planning ahead by carefully choosing a time and place having the right equipment and knowing what to look for you can get the best views and appreciate stars in a new way,find somewhere away from bright lights it is easiest to see stars if you re away from large urban areas that produce a lot of artificial light at night this reduces visibility of the night sky making it harder to see stars the further you get away from urban lights the more stars you ll be able to see so try heading to rural areas or even parks or nature preserves 1 x research source stargaze when there s a new moon the darker the sky is the more stars become visible at night the size of the moon has a large effect on how bright or dark the sky if you go stargazing when the moon is at its smallest you will have a better view of the stars 2 x research source you can look up the phases of the moon online on various astronomical websites some weather forecasts will also include information about the moon go to a place with high elevation just as with landscapes on earth views of the stars become better the higher up you go being at a high elevation not only makes you relatively closer to the sky but also puts you above trees and other things that can block your view 3 x research source astronomers often place their observatories on mountains for these reasons if you can t make it out of a city though you can try stargazing from the top of a building you can research state and national parks to find public spaces with high elevations if you re interested you can often camp at the park you stargaze from 4 x research source go stargazing in the winter for the best views views of the night sky are usually best in the winter for several reasons there is less daylight in the winter so the sky gets darker at night and stays that way for longer also the leaves have fallen off of most trees so there tend to be more places to find an unobstructed view 5 x research source if you stargaze in the winter though you will want to make sure to bring heavy clothing and any other equipment you might need to keep yourself warm and safe pay attention to weather forecasts when planning a stargazing outing you want to make sure you have good clear weather cloudy skies will severely limit your ability to see stars additionally stargazing requires spending long stretches of time outdoors so you should avoid having to stand in the rain research upcoming astronomical events the night sky always has interesting things to see but there are sometimes occurrences that make stargazing particularly interesting comets or meteor showers for instance can be especially fun to watch if you want to see something like that while stargazing you can research upcoming astronomical events online astronomers often know what you will be able to see on a certain night well in advance a good place to start looking for this information is the nasa website which has a useful sky events calendar you can find that calendar here https eclipse gsfc nasa gov skycal skycal html research campsites to try finding place that has high elevation and relatively little light pollution you can begin by searching campsites in state or national parks some parks have particularly great areas for stargazing and many are free or inexpensive to enter many state and national parks have informative websites that let you know what kinds of activities you can do there if a website says nothing about stargazing however you can always call and ask to speak with a park ranger who should be able to answer your questions 6 x research source bring binoculars while telescopes are more commonly associated with stargazing binoculars can also be very useful for watching the night sky especially if you re just looking to try stargazing binoculars can be a simpler and more affordable option than getting a telescope 7 x research source there are many different brands and types of binoculars that you can research to choose the best ones for your needs 8 x research source bring a telescope if you re an advanced stargazer if you do want to make sure you can see as much as possible you will want to bring a telescope telescopes have been used by astronomers for centuries and they offer better clearer views of stars than any other device there are many different telescopes on the market but you will probably only need highly advanced models if you re especially serious about stargazing 9 x research source if you are looking to buy a telescope keep in mind that some of the most important factors are magnification power portability type and price 10 x research source bring charging equipment for your devices depending on how long you plan on spending outdoors stargazing you will want to bring external chargers for your phone and any other devices you have with you you can find a variety of usb chargers online that should serve your needs if you are bringing a lot of high tech gear you may want to bring a portable power source 11 x research source take along a chair if you plan on stargazing for several hours or a whole night you should bring a portable folding chair so you don t have to stand the whole time ideally you should have a chair that enables you to use your telescope comfortably you don t want to put undue strain on your neck or back by hunching over your telescope 12 x research source if you re going with several people you can also spread a blanket on the ground so multiple people can sit at once dress for the weather keep an eye on the weather forecast and be prepared for the weather you ll face when you go stargazing no matter the season it makes sense to bring several layers along that way you will always be able to adjust how many warm clothes you re wearing to make yourself as comfortable as possible 13 x research source if you re going in the winter you will especially want to make sure you have a proper coat warm socks and other warm layers like sweaters sweatshirts and scarves 14 x research source bring bottles of water as you will probably be away from the indoors for at least several hours you will want to make sure to bring plenty of water with you you do not want to ruin your stargazing experience by becoming dehydrated if you re going in the winter you may also want to bring a thermos so you can have warm liquids like hot tea or soup on hand wear gloves in the winter you will definitely need to bring gloves though even in summer temperatures can get much chillier at night you may want to bring gloves that have either retractable coverings over the fingers or no covering this will help you to operate your telescope binoculars or other equipment 15 x research source take a small table if you re bringing a lot of equipment depending on how much equipment you re bringing with you you may want to bring a small portable table this will give you something besides the ground to spread out your stuff on a table can be especially useful for spreading out any stargazing guides you might bring 16 x research source bring reference material you will want to consult your star charts and star atlases while you stargaze these will help you to figure out what to look for and how to find it you can usually find star charts online in bookstores and in libraries 17 x research source identify important stars for orientation if you re in the northern hemisphere figure out how to find the north star if you re in the southern hemisphere learn how to identify the southern cross stargazers often use these markers to figure out what part of the sky they re looking at from these touchstones you can often easily identify other stars and constellations 18 x research source this process of using one star to identify the others around it is sometimes called star hopping and is often practiced by even veteran astronomers look for constellations constellations are groups of stars that sometimes form interesting shapes in the night sky one of the most recognizable of these in the northern hemisphere is the big dipper which looks like a spoon or a bowl with a handle constellations are not only beautiful to look at they can also help you to identify individual stars and orient yourself 19 x research source you can help yourself find constellations by consulting star charts and star atlases or by using a stargazing app go with a local astronomy club if you re new to stargazing or simply want to go with a group you can often find local astronomy clubs that organize stargazing outings if you want help identifying stars in the sky these clubs often have experienced members who can help teach you this might be especially useful if you re having trouble reading star charts 20 x research source many local astronomy clubs are affiliated with nasa s night sky network you can find a listing of these clubs on nasa s website 21 x research source download a stargazing app there are several apps for phones and tablets that can help you identify stars and constellations usually you simply put your device s camera at the night sky and the app tells you what stars and constellations you re looking at these are great educational tools for beginners they can also be an effective way to interest kids in stargazing 22 x research source some popular stargazing apps include skysafari and starmap learn the difference between stars and planets you can tell the difference between stars and planets by paying attention to the light they give off sparkling lights in the night sky tend to be stars while lights that don t sparkle and seem to keep a fixed position are usually planets 23 x research source keep a stargazing diary it might help you enjoy stargazing more if you if you keep track of what you see especially if you plan on going more than once in your diary you can record any details that you find relevant including your location the weather what equipment you used and so on 24 x research source relax while there is a lot you can plan for when stargazing remember to relax and enjoy yourself sometimes you will not be able to see as many stars as you d hoped and that s okay if you re new to stargazing you might have a harder time identifying stars than you d expected even if that s the case try not to get frustrated instead enjoy the time spent outdoors looking at the beauty of the stars,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to name a star,if you were interested in naming a star after yourself or someone you know several companies offer services to name your own star note that the star won t be the official name of the star and it s likely that the star has already been named something else in another registry while the name won t be official you ll receive a certificate and other astronomical gifts that will make you or someone you know feel special 1 x research source officially most stars have already been cataloged with a series of letters and numbers however larger more significant stars usually have a unique name given to them by different cultures or astronomers,search online for star naming registries several non official for profit online registries offer star naming services these registries give you a certificate for your star and other items like photographs of constellations a star map fact sheets and space themed accessories most packages will also include instructions on how to find your star in the sky look online at different companies and compare what they offer to help narrow down your decision 2 x research source the only official registry is the international astronomical union iau they define how stars and other celestial bodies are officially named for astronomical and scientific purposes compare gift packages and choose the one you like the best most online star naming registries will have different packages that you can buy if you want to get more merchandise you ll have to purchase a more expensive package look at the different packages and choose one based on your budget and what they have to offer 3 x research source star naming packages typically cost anywhere from 30 to 100 purchase the star and wait for your certificate to come in the mail once you select the package input your payment details and put in your order once you pay you ll be prompted to type in your desired star name most companies will then pick out a star for you and show you a photo of it in relation to other stars 4 x research source if you re naming a star after someone else you should input their address so that the package gets delivered to them you should receive an email confirmation and a receipt for your purchase email the iau to officially name unnamed comets or meteors though most stars constellations and planets have already been named new comets or meteors typically receive a name based on the person who discovered them if you have a telescope and see a comet or meteor that you don t think was named yet email cbatiau eps harvard edu as you track the comet or meteor make sure to keep meticulous records and contact the iau as soon as possible in the email include your name address contact details date and time of the observation the observation method and the observation site 5 x research source when a comet can be seen by the naked eye you typically can not name it since many other people discovered it at the same time the observation method could include a telescope naked eye or photograph the observation site should include the town or city name and longitude and latitude of your location when you made the discovery usually astronomers and teams of astronomers with telescopes are the first ones to find and name new comets and meteors name a star after someone you know for a thoughtful gift most people will name a star after someone they know as a gift again while the star may not be officially named across all registries the merchandise that you get with the package is a great gift for someone interested in astronomy having a star named after you will leave most people feeling happy and unique 6 x research source you can also name a star after someone who has passed away in honor of their name you can also name the star after yourself think of a name from ancient mythology for a historical approach most stars and constellations have been historically named based on characters from ancient mythology some stars and constellations may have more than 1 name depending on the culture or society that originally coined their names for example taurus was originally named ain in the original arabic text 7 x research source constellations named using greek mythology include andromeda draco and orion name a star by its size and constellation for an official name officially most stars are named by their constellation so astronomers can keep track of them usually the stars will have a designation after the constellation name like alpha or beta to describe their size for example the largest star in the orion constellation is named alpha orionis and the second largest star is called beta orionis 8 x research source alpha beta and gamma come from the greek alphabet this method of naming stars is called the bayer method discover a new star and name it after yourself when new stars are discovered they are named after the person or team who discovered them along with coordinates of the star astronomers or teams of astronomers with high powered telescopes are typically the ones who discover new stars these official names are cataloged by the international astronomical union and have names like luyten 726 8a bd 5deg 1668 and kruger 60 a it is highly unlikely that the star you find hasn t been cataloged but if you believe that you ve found a new star email cbatiau eps harvard edu and include details like the time you discovered the star your name address and contact information 9 x research source there s a good chance the star that you found has already been discovered you can cross reference the iau constellation and star catalogs to see whether the coordinates of your star match an already existing star the coordinates are calculated by determining the star s ascension and declination in space which is the equivalent to longitude and latitude on earth there are millions of stars that have already been cataloged by the international astronomical union don t pick a name you don t like if you keep getting trapped by two names put them together,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to view the international space station,orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth the international space station is inhabited by astronauts from multiple countries who live on board for months at a time the space station is often visible to the human eye as it flies above your location so follow these steps to find out when you can catch a glimpse of this amazing achievement,look up a chart of the international space station s appearances in your area you can follow one of the links listed below or search for international space station satellite chart online these charts contain several useful pieces of information that will help you figure out when a viewing is possible choose a website that allows you to enter your address city name or zip code if you enter inaccurate information the information listed may be incorrect try the charts at heavens above or nasa some sites may attempt to automatically detect your location based on your internet service provider s nearest server this is not always accurate so check for a name of the city or location used and switch to a different site if inaccurate some websites may abbreviate the international space station as iss find several times when the space station is visible for a few minutes sometimes from your location the iss will only take a few seconds to cross the visible portion of the sky other times it will take two minutes or more look for appearances that last as long as possible to give yourself the best chance of viewing the station write down several of these appearance appearances at night within a few hours of sunset or sunrise will be easiest to see more information on brightness is provided in the next step to help you find out whether the station will be visible during the day some charts will list the length of the appearance in its own column while on others you may need to calculate the appearance length yourself by subtracting the start time from the end time these times are usually written as three numbers in hour minute second format check whether the site uses a 24 hour clock or the a m p m system use the chart to narrow these times down to the brightest appearances most charts should list the space station s brightness or magnitude find another one if yours does not include this information the brightness scale is a little odd a negative number such as 4 is actually brighter than a positive number such as 3 here are some guidelines to help you understand what brightness ratings may be viewable 1 x research source a magnitude of 4 to 2 is the brightest the space station typically gets and may even be visible during the day 2 to 4 is usually visible at night but you may have difficulty seeing it if there are bright city lights in your area 4 to 6 is dim approaching the limits of the human eye if the night sky is clear and there are few ground lights in your area you might just be able to see the station binoculars are recommended to get a rough idea of how bright the station will be compare it to these approximate magnitudes the sun during the day has a magnitude of about 26 7 the moon has magnitude 12 5 and venus one of the remaining brightest objects in the sky has magnitude 4 4 look up the weather forecast once you ve picked a time when the station will be bright and visible for a relatively long period look up the weather forecast for that day try to find an hour by hour weather forecast if possible to see whether there will be cloud cover blocking your view during this time weather forecasts are often inaccurate more than a day in advance so check again 24 hours before the station is due to appear to get an up to date prediction find the position of the space station on a satellite chart refer to the space station appearances chart you found in the last section it should have a column labeled with one of the following where to look appears azimuth or az look at the contents of this column to find out the general area of the sky the space station will appear in look n orth e ast s outh or w est according to the letter or word listed in that column the chart may give you a more specific instruction between one of these four directions for instance nw northwest means halfway between north and west nnw north northwest means halfway between north and northwest read about using a compass if you are not sure how to find a direction know how high to look the same chart should have a column labeled altitude with numbers listed below as degrees or the degree symbol º astronomers divide the sky into many segments called degrees so they can refer to a specific position in the sky a position of 0º is at the horizon 90º is directly above your head and 45º is exactly in between 0º and 90º to find rough positions in between these numbers extend your arm fully in front of you and close your hand into a fist the distance from the horizon to the top of your first is roughly 10º if you are looking for 20º for example place your fist just above the horizon then place your other fist on top of the first the point above your second fist is about 20º keep alternating fists to find positions at higher degrees 2 x research source it may seem strange that the space station suddenly appears in the middle of the sky instead of coming around the horizon this can happen because the space station is only visible when light from the sun is reflecting off it when the space station moves out of the earth s shadow it suddenly becomes visible it may also not be visible near sunrise or sunset until it has moved high enough in the sky to escape the bright background of the sun s glow look for the space station at this position at the time specified on the star chart look for the space station at the direction and height you found in the earlier steps the space station usually looks like a moving dot or small white or yellowish sphere it does not blink or flash repeatedly but if you re lucky it might flare brighter for a moment as sunlight glints on an especially reflective surface it will not have multi colored lights there will not be a contrail use binoculars only if necessary binoculars make it easier to see fainter objects a 50mm binocular typically lets you see brightness up to 10 on the magnitude scale described in the previous section 3 x research source however it may be hard to find the space station with binoculars alone since you can only see a small part of the sky through them it s best to find the station with your naked eye then lift binoculars to your eyes without looking away from the station a telescope allows you to see even fainter objects but it can be almost impossible to find the space station unless you have a way to precisely measure where the telescope is pointing use a similar strategy as described for binoculars but pick a time when the station will be visible for several minutes if you are not experienced at using your telescope,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find a star,to find a specific star you ll need to find its coordinates using a star map app or celestial globe then you ll need to use your longitude and latitude to determine whether or not the star can be seen from your location to do this use a star s right ascension and declination to determine when and where a star will be on a given night once you ve confirmed a star s location and cross referenced it with your longitude and latitude go out stargazing on a clear night to find your star,use longitude and latitude as reference points you can t interpret a star s coordinates or read a star map if you don t understand longitude and latitude latitude refers to the parallel lines that run east and west around the globe the higher a latitude s number is the further away from the equator a location is longitude refers to the vertical lines that run north and south from the north to south pole they measure a location s distance from the prime meridian 1 x research source the numbers for latitude go up to 90 degrees 90 degrees north is near the north pole while 90 degrees south is in antarctica the equator is equidistant between the 2 poles and is 0 degrees the numbers for longitude go from 0 to 180 degrees they start at 0 at the prime meridian the prime meridian is an arbitrary line that runs from the north to south pole through europe and africa know how the celestial sphere relates to longitude and latitude the celestial sphere is an imaginary extension of the earth that is used to map the location of stars relative to the earth s position the problem is because the earth rotates and moves the location of celestial objects appears to move as well when referencing locations of stars you ll need to be able to cross reference a star s right ascension ra and declination dec relative to the earth s longitude and latitude 2 x research source it helps to imagine the celestial sphere as a giant bubble around earth there are globes that you can buy that map out major constellations and stars on a projection of the celestial sphere buy one to make it easier to reference to cross check a star s location understand what ra and dec measure ra and dec are units of measurement that stand for right ascension and declination they re based on the celestial sphere with the right ascension referring to the vertical lines that run from the north celestial pole to the south celestial pole the lines that run perpendicular relative to the poles in the celestial sphere are the lines of declination 3 x research source in other words declination is a celestial version of latitude and right ascension is the celestial version of longitude the celestial poles and equator are an extension of the earth s equator and poles like coordinates on earth the celestial coordinates are fixed positions in other words a specific star will always be located at the same coordinates regardless of when you re trying to find it the symbol for right ascension looks like a cursive lower case a the symbol for declination looks like a lower case o with a bar on top read right ascension to figure out when a star will come into view because the earth is constantly spinning you use the right ascension to determine how long it will take for the earth to rotate and face a star there are 24 hours in a day and the right ascension coordinates are given in units of time based on a day for example polaris s ra is 2h 41m 39s that means that it takes polaris 2 hours 41 minutes and 39 seconds to come into view if you re starting at the location of the vernal equinox 4 x research source the arbitrary starting point for ra is the location of the sun on the first day of spring the location of this line changes every year and it is called the vernal equinox think of this as the prime meridian on a celestial sphere right ascension is always measured going east each hour means that 1 24th of the earth has been traveled this corresponds to 15 degrees along the equator interpret declination to figure out where a star will be if right ascension tells you when a star will appear declination tells you where a star will be in the sky look up the declination for the star you want to find and check the first number listed which is the only one you need to have a star this number will be in degrees and it will tell you how high or low a star in the sky will be relative to the equator 5 x research source the or sign at the beginning of the declination number tells you whether the star is in the northern or southern hemisphere the plus sign means that the star is in the northern hemisphere while the minus sign means that the star is in the southern hemisphere a star that has a declination starting in 0 sits directly above the equator for example polaris has a dec of 89 15 50 8 this means that polaris is 89 degrees north of the equator see if your latitude matches a star s dec to see where it will cross your view you can only view a star if it crosses your path at a declination that matches your location if you live at 39 degrees north and the declination of a star is 39 then it will pass directly overhead generally a range of 45 degrees in either direction will be visible from your location at some point so someone living at 39 degrees north will be able to find stars with decs from 84 to 6 6 x research source use your longitude and a star s ra to see when it will cross your view for every 15 degrees of separation in longitude between 0 and your location add 1 hour you will be able to see stars in your night sky within a 3 hour window in either direction from this point because the earth drifts through space as it spins the celestial grid drifts this is called precession which means that you ll have to look up the differential on a given night by referring to a star map 7 x research source for example detroit michigan is roughly 85 west this translates roughly to 5h 30m right ascension this means that if a star has a declination between 15 and 75 and an ra between 8h 30m and 2h 30m it may be visible on a given night from detroit generally speaking you can see stars within a 3 hour window in either direction this is because each hour translates to 15 and your maximum range in either direction is 45 degrees get a star map and take it with you when stargazing you can purchase a physical star map but a digital version will be easier to read sites like in the sky https in the sky org skymap2 php generate star maps based on your location which make it easy to determine which celestial objects are visible from where you are you can also use a star map to cross reference a star s ra and dec to see if it matches your longitude and latitude before heading out on a clear night 8 x research source star maps have a compass that will help you reorient them based on whether you re facing north south east or west buy a celestial globe to cross reference star locations in 3d imagining where a star is in relation to where you live can be tough but a celestial globe will make it easier celestial globes contain a projection of the stars with an actual globe underneath visit an online star database to look up coordinates for specific stars there are plenty of online star databases which are excellent resources for looking up the ra and dec for specific celestial objects you can simply type in a star s name in a database s search bar to retrieve the star s coordinates databases will often provide an image of the celestial object as it appears in the sky to make identifying the star easy 9 x research source one example of a digital database is http www sky map org get a telescope with a compass and equatorial mount get a telescope with a compass and an equatorial mount to make finding coordinates easy the compass will keep you oriented as you turn the telescope and an equatorial mount will show you measurements for ra and dec when you tilt and rotate your compass 10 x research source binoculars are a great way to find stars if you don t want to jump right into stargazing with a telescope get as high as you can to get the best view if you re looking for a specific star you ll have a much easier time if you can search from a higher altitude where the air is thinner if you live in an area with hills or mountains consider getting higher up off of the ground to get a better view the oxygen is thinner the higher up you go which makes it easier for your telescope to interpret light the influence of light pollution also tends to be weakened the higher up you go 11 x research source this is why you often see amateur stargazers getting on their roof or balcony to do some stargazing even a slight change in elevation can help make stargazing easier stay away from light pollution and clouds if you can artificial lights on the ground and cloudy weather can interfere with stargazing to give yourself the greatest chance of finding a star go stargazing on a clear night leave the city or town that you live in if you can and set up your telescope in a remote area far from any streetlights or skyscrapers 12 x research source there are dark parks where lights aren t allowed that are designed specifically for stargazing look online to see if you live near one and consider visiting it if you want to give yourself the best possible chance of finding a star find a major celestial object as a reference point so you found your star s ra and dec and calculated that it can be seen from your location at a given time you ll still need to make slight adjustments to your telescope or binoculars to identify a star one of the easiest ways to do this is to use a major celestial object with an ra and dec similar to the star that you re looking for and work from there 13 x research source move in increments of 10 degrees by making a fist hold your arm out straight with the back of your hand facing you hold it up in the sky with your reference point on the left edge of your hand the area directly on the right edge will be approximately 10 degrees away from the left side of your hand 14 x research source for example if you re using polaris as a reference point you know that it is at 89 dec if you re looking for the big dipper which starts at 61 dec then you can place two fists next to each other to find the approximate location of the big dipper the way that this changes measurements depends upon the direction that you re facing if you re looking north away from the equator the right side of your hand will be 10 lower in terms of ra if you re facing south towards the equator it will be 10 higher the same is true for declination you can convert ra to angles by converting every hour to 15 this means that each fist you make translates to roughly 45 minutes of right ascension hold up a pinky finger to make 1 adjustments hold up your fist away from you and stick up a pinky finger the width of your pinky finger will correspond with approximately 1 in the night sky once you ve found a reference point hold a pinky finger out over your telescope and use the approximate width to move your telescope in minor adjustments 15 x research source this is a particularly helpful trick when making minor adjustments to a telescope without a compass or equatorial mount,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to view an eclipse,catching sight of an eclipse is a wonderful event and there are people who invest much time and love into chasing eclipses around the world at its most basic an eclipse occurs when one object passes through the shadow of another while most people are familiar with solar eclipses there are actually both solar and lunar eclipses and both are worth the effort if you re a serious stargazer no words or photos can ever replace the experience of seeing an eclipse for yourself,read about a solar eclipse solar eclipses occur when the sun the moon and the earth are all in alignment allowing the moon to block the sunlight from reaching the earth 1 x research source solar eclipses are observed as a total or partial eclipse depending on whether or not you re located in the umbra the place where the moon s shadow hits a small point of earth or the penumbra the part outside of the umbra the amount of time a total eclipse lasts can be from a few seconds to a maximum of seven and half minutes as the umbra moves along the path of totality there is also an annular eclipse when the moon slides across the sun but doesn t completely cover it 2 x research source total solar eclipses are possible because the sun is 400 times further away from earth than the moon and 400 times larger than the moon allowing the sun and moon to appear to be almost the same size from our perspective of the sky 3 x research source be aware of the methods that shouldn t be used for viewing a solar eclipse you shouldn t look at eclipses through binoculars telescopes any type of glasses sunglasses smoked glass polarizing filters or exposed color film none of these methods are strong enough to protect your eyes 4 x research source 5 x research source although the light wavelengths visible to the human eye are blocked by these objects it is the non visible light that causes damage to the eye the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths still get through and cause just as much damage as the visible light make an eclipse viewer or a pinhole projector a homemade eclipse viewer or pinhole viewer is very simply done and generally speaking it is the easiest and safest way to view an eclipse for just the price of some thick poster paper or cardstock its drawback is the very small image it produces but this one is ideal for children and young teens who will enjoy the process of preparing the pinhole projector and then using it 6 x research source poke a small hole using a pin or thumbtack through the center of a piece of cardstock place a second piece of paper on the ground to serve as the screen you will be projecting the eclipse onto standing with your back to the sun hold the card a few feet off the ground above your shoulder or to your side make sure your head is not covering up the hole it should be held in the direction of the sun and you should be facing the screen you placed on the ground when the projector is properly aligned you should see a perfect circle on the other piece of card you placed on the ground the circle may appear fuzzy at the edges you can bring it into sharper focus by moving the pinhole projector closer or further away from the ground when the eclipse takes place that circle will shrink and turn into a crescent if it is a partial eclipse if it is a total eclipse then it will turn into a thin lined o you can also use a pinhole camera for eclipse viewing use a solar filter on your viewing equipment if you choose to look at the sun with your eyes rather than by projecting the sun onto something else then you must always have a solar filter between you and the eclipse while it is possible to view a total solar eclipse without protection during totality only an experienced observer will know when to judge this moment accurately and when it is essential to immediately place the filter between your eyes and the eclipse again before the sun reappears 7 x research source since most eclipses are partial and most observers are novices it is much safer to only look at the eclipse through a solar filter even the briefest flash of sunlight can damage your eyesight so even 99 9 percent of coverage of the sun is dangerous solar filters are available for all viewing equipment camera binoculars and telescope when selecting a solar filter for a telescope or binoculars it is absolutely vital that you choose a filter made for your exact model and brand if the filter does not fit properly or is used incorrectly permanent eye damage can occur view an eclipse indirectly by making a projection projection of the eclipse image through binoculars or a telescope is another safe method to view the eclipse indirectly however it is only safe if you use it for projection not for looking through do not look through the binoculars or telescope doing the projecting 8 x research source cover the front objective lens of one side of the binoculars with a piece of cardboard or a lens cap with your back to the sun hold the binoculars with one hand and aim them towards the eclipse so that the uncovered lens picks up the eclipse use the shadow of the binoculars to help you align the binoculars watch the image projected back onto a screen wall or large piece of white paper that you re holding in your free hand it should be situated about one foot from the binocular s eyepiece just move the binoculars around until the eclipse image appears on the card screen or wall the further you hold the card away from the eyepiece the larger the image will be when you get used to using this method try fixing the binoculars to something like a tripod or propping them up against a chair or table the image will benefit from the increased steadiness if you re using this method to observe the sun during a non eclipse time shift the binoculars away from the sun every minute to prevent overheating of the equipment let the optical equipment cool down for a few minutes before trying again use welder s glass shade number 14 or higher welder s glass is one of the most affordable and widely available filters you can use to observe the sun with unaided eyes the glass must completely cover your eyes at all times of observation 9 x research source such a filter can also be added to the front of your binocular objectives again all of the lens must be covered and if it can only cover one lens cap the other one use mounted filters there are special types of filters that can be purchased that mount directly onto a telescope or pair of binoculars while some of these can get quite expensive there are cheaper versions that will still protect your eyes and allow you to view the sun there are several important warnings you must take heed of when purchasing and mounting a solar filter 10 x research source you must be absolutely sure that the filter is a proper solar filter as ordinary photographic filters will not filter the dangerous rays the filter must fit your brand and type of equipment perfectly always buy the filter from a reputable dealer if you have any concerns about the safety of the filter do not use it and if you need advice take it to your local planetarium or astronomy club for expert advice check for surface damage prior to mounting mylar is easy to puncture or rip and if that has happened the filter cannot be used be sure that the filter is secure once on if you need to tape it as well as mount it to ensure that it won t come off or loosen then do so do not use filters that screw into the eyepiece end of binoculars or telescopes the focused light can burn through or crack the filter at this end owing to the intense heat of the sun being concentrated just the tiniest crack or separation in the filter can permanently damage your eyes only use filters that mount onto the front end of the telescope read about lunar eclipses lunar eclipses occur less frequently than total eclipses of the sun with a lunar eclipse taking place about twice a year and a total lunar eclipse happening on average every two to three years a lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon travels into the earth s shadow and becomes a coppery or dull red color a blood moon 11 x research source total lunar eclipses can last for up to an hour and forty minutes although a lunar eclipse can last for up to six hours when adding in the time taken to pass through the penumbral region like solar eclipses there are total and partial lunar eclipses that depend on the alignment of the earth the sun and the moon be prepared to stay up late a lunar eclipse occurs only during a full moon when it is perfectly aligned with the earth and the sun the eclipse happens because the earth casts a shadow on the moon lunar eclipses usually occur late at night over a period of hours as the moon passes in and out of the shadow cast by the earth if you want to see the whole thing you will have to stay up late 12 x research source the night must be clear and fairly cloud free for optimal viewing view with your naked eye or through magnifying objects as desired lunar eclipses are perfectly safe to observe with your eyes and without a filter you don t need any special viewing equipment because you are not looking directly into the sun you re actually viewing a projection of the sun onto the moon 13 x research source because there is no risk of damage to your eyes from the sun no special equipment is required 14 x research source to get a more impressive view of the eclipse you can look at it through binoculars or a telescope if you d like to photograph the lunar eclipse read how to photograph the moon for more details on moon photography or how to photograph an eclipse for advice on photographing both solar and lunar eclipses dress appropriately given you ll be viewing at night the air will probably be colder so dress warmly and perhaps take along a thermos of something warm to drink bring along something comfortable to sit on as the eclipse will last for over an hour find out when and where eclipses are happening it s hard to view eclipses when you re not aware they re happening one of the best ways of knowing when eclipses will happen is to use the internet and follow updates on reputable sites in addition some good astronomy books and periodicals will also keep you updated about forthcoming eclipses some of the sites worth keeping an eye on include nasa eclipse website here this has both solar and lunar eclipse details see also nasa eclipse path maps through 2020 and through 2040 some of your favorite science and astronomy information websites and blogs might update you about upcoming eclipses as they re about to happen check the weather forecast leading up to an eclipse some weather elements will make it hard to see an eclipse such as clouds or a storm if it s clear you re all set to watch use this weather forecast to dress appropriately for the eclipse if it s winter and you ll be watching a lunar eclipse you ll want to bundle up to stay warm 15 x research source visit your eclipse viewing site in advance if it s your own backyard you ll already be familiar with it but if you want to go somewhere with a clearer view check it out before the eclipse see what the terrain is like where you can park your car whether it s likely to be popular with other people etc there are actually some key things to look for when selecting a good eclipse viewing spot 16 x research source view choose a spot with a good view of the horizon to enable you to see approaching and departing shadows comfort are there restrooms refreshments shade options etc accessibility is it easy to reach easy to park easy to walk around and so forth familiarity is it likely to attract busloads of tourists if there is ease of access for buses bus parking and you ve seen the site getting buzz on twitter and facebook you might want to find somewhere less well known and therefore less likely to be crowded if you know someone who has a farm ranch or quiet open property in the vicinity of the eclipse consider asking them if they mind you turning up to watch the eclipse,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to buy a spotting scope,a spotting scope is similar to a small telescope it is an instrument used by hobbyists and scientists to get a closer look at distant objects spotting scopes are primarily used for bird watching astronomy and target shooting buy a spotting scope that has a magnification level and other features that are appropriate for what you need,decide between an angled spotting scope and a straight spotting scope many users prefer a straight scope where the eyepieces are parallel in an angled scope the eyepiece is offset at 45 degrees or 90 degrees from the scope barrel buy a straight scope if you will be watching birds from cars or you plan to keep the scope setting at your height with a straight scope your eyes will stay level with the object you are looking at through the lens smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb b be buy a spotting scope step 1bullet1 jpg v4 459px buy a spotting scope step 1bullet1 jpg bigurl images thumb b be buy a spotting scope step

a lot waterproof or weatherproof scopes are necessary if you use the spotting scope outdoors in different types of weather some come with rubber armor for protection keeping the lens protected from rain is necessary to prevent condensation damaging your visibility consider the weight of the scope if you will be traveling with the spotting scope or carrying it around in the field choose something lightweight set a budget spotting scopes can cost from 200 to 2 000 the more expensive scopes often provide a higher optical performance look for a folded light path this is an optical setup that combines mirrors and lenses to form a total scope length that is shorter than the actual focal length of the scope the light performance will provide a long focal length and keep the design compact look for magnesium fluoride coating on the lens surface this will prevent light loss and reduce glare from reflection the more coating on the lens the brighter the image will appear you will also have less eyestrain buy a scope with a larger exit pupil for a brighter image the column of light that comes out of the spotting scope is defined as an exit pupil the exit pupil gets smaller when the magnification is higher giving you a dimmer image find a scope with extended eye relief especially if you wear glasses eye relief is the distance you can hold a spotting scope away from your eye while still getting a full view make sure you buy a scope with a large field of view if you are using it to watch birds and wildlife the field of view refers to the width of the circular viewing field in the spotting scope a wider field of view will give you an advantage if you are watching animals or sights that move quickly look for a spotting scope with appropriate magnification and lens size measurements are read by looking at the 2 numbers which have an x separating them as an example a measurement might read 45 x 60 find the magnification or power of the spotting scope by looking at the first number of the measurement with a 45 x 60 spotting scope the object you are viewing looks 45 times closer than it would without the scope find the lens size by looking at the second number in the measurement in the 45 x 60 measurement the 60 represents the diameter available on the front lens this is a larger than average measurement which will allow additional light into the spotting scope resulting in an image that is brighter buy your spotting scope at any outdoor retailer that carries scopes binoculars and other outfitting items for bird watchers hunters and wildlife enthusiasts they

how to become an amateur astronomy hobbyist,astronomy can be a fun and rewarding hobby offering you a lifetime of fascinating observations and discoveries as an amateur astronomer astronomy can also be an expensive and frustrating hobby if you approach it without knowing what you re doing before you spend your money on an expensive telescope or other equipment spend some time learning the basics of astronomy and what resources are available to help you learn more about it the following steps will help you derive more enjoyment from your experience as an amateur astronomy hobbyist,read astronomy books there are a number of excellent books on astronomy including dinah moché s astronomy a self teaching guide de pree and axelrod s the complete idiot s guide to astronomy dickinson and dyer s the backyard astronomer s guide paaschoff and tirion s a field guide to the stars and planets and fred price s the planet observer s handbook good astronomy books will provide you with an overview of the history of astronomical observation a description of the solar system and its planets and moons descriptions of what constellations can be seen at any given time and pictures of stars nebulas comets globular clusters and galaxies you can find books for purchase at bookstores and on internet sites such as amazon com your local library also offers a number of books on the subject that you can check out for free when selecting astronomy books look for the most recent copyright dates you can find ideally within the last 5 years the pace of astronomical discovery makes a lot of information such as the planetary status and presumed size of pluto outdated read astronomy magazines magazines such as astronomy astronomy now or sky and telescope feature articles on recent astronomical discoveries and reviews of new books and software applications for computers and smartphones they also offer lists of internet websites devoted to astronomy and offer tips for the beginning astronomer one magazine night sky introduced in 2004 is even devoted to the new amateur astronomer search the internet a number of astronomy related organizations such as the astronomical league and the society for popular astronomy have their own websites to disseminate information about astronomy in general as well as the specifics of their organizations nasa also has a number of astronomy related offerings such as the astronomy picture of the day and astronomy education resources for both students and teachers many amateur astronomers have their own websites where they discuss astronomy in general and post their observations the internet also is a good source of astronomy freeware and shareware you ll want at least a planetarium program and depending on your astronomical interests a program that tracks the planets positions in the solar system and one that reports the moon phase for a given date join an online astronomy discussion forum or discussion group sites such as google groups msn groups and yahoo groups feature a number of astronomy discussion groups covering astronomy in general or specific aspects such as astrophotography cosmology exoplanets or meteor showers most groups let you post messages and participate in discussions either by email or on the forum itself attend planetarium shows planetariums display images of the night sky on a semicircular dome some planetarium shows are designed for the astronomy novice while other shows are oriented to amateur astronomers strongly interested in a particular subject and still others are designed so that visitors can set up their own programs from a selection of shows planetariums can be found on college campuses and in science museums visit observatories some astronomical observatories have nights open to the general public these provide the opportunity to see an astronomical object through a telescope larger than that available to the average astronomy hobbyist attend meetings of a local astronomy club local astronomy clubs give you the chance to meet with other amateur astronomy hobbyists face to face and learn from one another these clubs separately or with other clubs organize star parties and sunspot viewing sessions and have regular presentations on various astronomical topics these clubs oversee astronomy viewing programs such as viewing the objects listed in the messier catalog and award certificates to amateur astronomers motivated enough to complete them some clubs maintain their own observing sites and keep a collection of telescopes that can be checked out to members attend astronomy panels at science fiction conventions many science fiction fans are also astronomy buffs and so many of the conventions they put on include astronomy panel presentations and displays you can check sources such as locus or the science fiction chronicle for a list of conventions and then search the websites for the conventions near you to see if they have an astronomy programming track many convention websites also feature links to other conventions websites so if the first convention whose site you visit doesn t mention anything for the amateur astronomer visit other sites until you find what you re looking for start simple you don t need to have an expensive telescope to observe the night sky it s possible to see the andromeda galaxy 2 2 million light years away with the naked eye if the sky is sufficiently dark and you re well away from city lights a telescope simply makes it possible to see dimmer objects better than you can see them with the naked eye you ll find these items helpful to get first and have with you before you buy a telescope a good quality field guide some field guides have laminated pages to prevent them from being damaged by spills dew or rain a planisphere this is a device that displays a printed image of the night sky with markings at the edges for the month and day of the year and the time of night simply align the viewing area with the correct day and time and you ll see what stars and constellations should be visible at your location a red flashlight you can cover the lens of a regular flashlight with red cellophane or you can buy a flashlight with a red bulb or led you can use either a handheld flashlight or one that is worn over the shoulders or on the forehead look for a good observing area your best observing will be on dark clear nights when the moon is low in the sky or new and when you are well away from city lights if you live out in the country your backyard would be a suitable location as would a park on the outskirts of the city if it isn t possible to get out of the city very often you can start your observations with the objects you can see best such as the moon major constellations and the planets look for constellations and major stars that can help you find your way around the sky although there are 88 constellations altogether certain constellations parts of constellations and the stars in them can help you find other constellations depending on the season and time of night the big dipper part of the northern hemisphere constellation ursa major can be used to find a number of stars and constellations the stars merak and dubhe on the outer edge of its bowl can be used to find the north star polaris by going in the direction the dipper opens and the star regulus in the constellation leo by going in the direction of the bowl base following the stars in the dipper s handle in an arc leads to the star arcturus in the constellation bootes and then to the star spica in the constellation virgo the bright stars vega in the constellation lyra altair in the constellation aquila and deneb in the constellation cygnus form what is known in the northern hemisphere as the summer triangle deneb and the other 2 stars that form the swan s body in cygnus point to the star antares in the constellation scorpio three of the stars in the constellation pegasus algenib markab and scheat and the star alpheratz in the constellation andromeda form the great square of pegasus visible during fall in the northern hemisphere algenib and alpheratz along with the star caph in the w shaped constellation cassiopeia can be used to find polaris during times when the big dipper is below the horizon the constellation orion has a roughly hourglass shape and is visible from late fall to early spring in the northern hemisphere the stars in its belt can be used to point downward toward the star sirius or upward to the pleiades in the constellation taurus in the southern hemisphere the 2 brightest stars in the constellation centaurus can be used to point to the southern cross progress to binoculars before buying a telescope binoculars are lighter in weight and give a wider field of view than does a telescope and unlike a telescope they present their view right side up instead of inverted a good 7 x 35 binoculars should be sufficient to see lunar craters the phases of venus the largest moons of jupiter the pleiades and the great nebula in orion some larger pairs of binoculars intended for astronomical use require a tripod to stabilize them buy a telescope when you re ready for it after you ve done a fair amount of naked eye astronomy and observing the sky with binoculars you can consider getting a telescope you ll want to spend time reading advertisements and reviews in magazines and online and if you belong to an astronomy club with a telescope library trying out various telescopes to help you determine what features you do and don t need a good telescope should have a combination of the following features a sturdy smooth operating mount high quality optics look for a telescope advertised as having diffraction limited optics a large aperture opening the larger the aperture the larger the telescope however and larger telescopes can be bulky heavy or both be easy to set up and tear down some telescopes come equipped with onboard computer systems that direct built in motors to point the telescope to any object in their databases these features can be useful if you like to look at a number of objects during a viewing session but they add significantly to the telescope s cost they can supplement but should not replace your ability to find astronomical objects by yourself,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to teach kids about astronomy,astronomy is the oldest of the physical sciences the night sky and its array of stars wandering planets changing moon phases occasional comets and meteor showers and in far northern and southern latitudes shimmering auroras have fascinated mankind and stimulated the imagination of generations with the recent discoveries of planets orbiting other stars and the exotic environments of the planets and moons in our own solar system the opportunity is there to fascinate a new generation with the wonders of the universe teaching children astronomy can appear challenging to the point of intimidation but with some knowledge of astronomy and your child s particular interests related to the subject you can stimulate your child s interest in astronomy following are some ideas and methods for teaching astronomy to children,develop your own interest in astronomy in order to interest children in astronomy you yourself need to have some interest in the subject while many of the activities suggested in the following steps will further your interest along with your child s you first need to familiarize yourself with the planets their moons and some of the major constellations you can find a number of resources at your local library or bookstore and on the internet some of which will be discussed in later steps while you read up on the solar system and universe take some time to look at the night sky this will make real some of what you re learning and help you find places to interest your child in astronomy as well encourage your child to explore and experiment science not just astronomy is based on coming up with ideas and testing them out to see if they work much of the way children play is devoted to exploring and understanding the world around them while you should restrict your child from doing anything that would hurt someone or that is simply unacceptable behavior giving him or her the opportunity to play with various things with supervision is a good way to stimulate creativity and to develop a desire to learn new things for encouraging a love of astronomy many parents choose to buy their child his or her own telescope while a telescope is a good way to view the night sky in many cases it may be better to start your child observing the night sky with a good pair of binoculars and then move to a telescope as he or she shows a deepening interest in the subject look for books that explain astronomy in language you and your child can understand a good book on astronomy should explain concepts in simple clear real world language with examples that your child can relate to and plenty of pictures you ll want 2 kinds of books a desk reference that you can keep in the house and a field guide that you can take with you on outings in your backyard and elsewhere one good astronomy field guide is howard schneider s backyard guide to the night sky choose interesting astronomy software computer software adds a visual dimension to teaching astronomy to children along with the ability to control what they learn astronomy programs include star map programs that display the night sky for various dates from various latitudes orrery programs that chart the positions of the planets ephemeris programs that give rising and setting times for the moon and planets and programs that graphically display moon phases for any date many programs are available commercially at software stores or on the internet and other good programs are available as freeware or shareware on the internet one good freeware program is celestia created by a development team led by chris laurel it is designed to let users tour the solar system and the stars in its catalog by either entering the name of a destination or browsing the solar system or its star catalog you can tour other solar systems and return to our own by selecting our sun select sol read summaries of solar system objects and then display them or see a list of stars currently known to have planets orbiting them you can capture any of the images displayed and even create short animated tours of your own the program is available at http www shatters net celestia you can install star map programs on a laptop or tablet computer and take it with you when exploring the night sky check with the manual for your laptop or tablet for the minimum air temperature at which it can be safely operated and any recommended means to protect the unit against moisture if you decide to do this with the advent of the smartphone astronomy software is now available as downloadable applications for the iphone android and other systems one such app is google sky which works with global positioning satellites to let you point your phone at a location in the sky and display and identify the constellation your phone is aimed at on its screen visit astronomy and space related internet sites there are a vast number of websites that can help you teach astronomy to children or simply help them further their interests sites such as http www kidsastronomy com http osr org en us articles great space and astronomy lesson plan ideas and http geology com teacher astronomy space shtml are clearinghouse for astronomy lesson plans for teachers and for parents who home school their children nasa also maintains an education website covering concepts in astronomy and science in general ttp www nasa gov audience foreducators index html as well as an astronomy picture of the day site http apod nasa gov apod astropix html visit planetariums while astronomy software can display constellations it can only do so on a single flat computer monitor instead of the large hemisphere that planetariums use as a display screen planetariums also let multiple users share the experience of viewing a simulation of the night sky accompanied either by a lecture given by the operator or a recorded show that may also include projections of still photos or movies on a portion of the screen a few even feature a series of pre recorded programs from which viewers can assemble their own customized shows planetariums may be found on college campuses or attached to science history or children s museums planetariums attached to science museums often include exhibits in rooms adjacent to the planetarium that cover the history of astronomy or space exploration some colleges with astronomy programs own observatories as well as planetariums these observatories may be open to the public 1 night a month either year round or during seasons such as spring or fall in addition to offering visitors the opportunity to look through its main telescope they also feature short lectures on the night sky and science demonstrations by visiting professors and graduate students go to science fiction conventions with a science component many science fiction conventions have a dedicated science track with panel presentations by guests who ve been associated with astronomy and space exploration in some fashion such as current or former nasa or jet propulsion laboratory employees conventions also feature art shows many of which may include art by artists who specialize in astronomical art and dealers rooms in which you can purchase astronomical art you can learn about science fiction conventions in your area by doing an internet search or through publications such as locus science fiction chronicle or other magazines dedicated to science fiction fandom many conventions also feature reciprocal links to other conventions so that if the first convention whose site you visit doesn t interest you you can look for others that might decorate your child s room with an astronomy theme you can further your child s interest in astronomy by painting the ceiling of his or her room with the planets of the solar system or a view of the night sky hang astronomy related posters and art on the walls or both if your child has particular artistic talent he or she can do this with you integrate astronomy with your and your child s creative talents if either you or your child have musical ability you can write songs about certain astronomical concepts or objects such as a song about the planet venus to the tune of either the frankie avalon or bananarama songs of the same name if you and your child share an interest in computers or broadcasting you can do your own astronomy podcast as suggested previously you can also encourage your child to produce space themed art if he or she has artistic ability science fiction conventions have long featured late night sessions of folksinging devoted to original songs and song parodies with a science or science fiction theme some conventions are now offering talent showcases for attendees to perform their own creative works in front of others if your child has both a performing and an astronomical interest this can be a suitable venue to share his or her creative works with others view the night sky with your child if you enjoy camping take along a field guide and pair of binoculars or a telescope to do some field observing of the stars planets and constellations you can also view the sky from a deserted road or from your own backyard if you re sufficiently far away from city lights that can obscure your view of dimmer stars be aware that as the moon approaches its full phase it gets brighter and can make it harder to see dimmer stars in the sky if you choose to view the sky during or near the night of the full moon you may want to make it the primary focus of your observing session join an astronomy club astronomy clubs are great local resources for promoting and supporting interest in astronomy for both children and adults some clubs have their own observing areas from which members can observe the night sky at regular times and maintain an inventory of telescopes that can be checked out to members some clubs organize star parties by themselves or jointly with other clubs at which a large number of astronomy enthusiasts gather and they also have observing programs with certificates of accomplishment for such things as viewing all the objects in the messier catalog many astronomy clubs have an education or outreach coordinator who works with local school systems to interest children in astronomy this person can also be a resource to you in providing ideas to teach astronomy to your child make astronomy a part of your daily life the easiest way to reinforce lessons learned in teaching astronomy to children is to make astronomy a part of your everyday life you can point out newspaper articles on the latest discovery of a new planet or new fact about one of our planets or watch astronomy related science shows on television and discuss them over the breakfast or dinner table for young children you can celebrate their mercury birthday with a small gift 4 times a year mercury s orbital period is 88 days as

looking at the sun is very dangerous you should never attempt to look at it without some from of protection read on to learn about simple ways to view the sun without damaging your eyes,buy some shades sun glasses remember to only look for a few seconds at a time and then look away to allow your eyes to recover try not to stare too often at the sun even with shades on it can cause some irritation to your eyes the brightness of the sun is nothing to be taken for granted look at the sun behind tinted glass there are many cars that have tinted windows you can look at the sun for a few moments behind the tinted glass if the glass is not tinted thoroughly then don t stare for too long squint your eyes very tight try looking at the sun while having your eyelids almost shut this will be another good way of looking at the sun for a very short moment purchase a 10 welding filter from a hardware store automotive store or specialty welding supply store this specially designed glass transmits only a fraction of the sun s light and can be used to view the sun for minutes at a time these filters do add a green tint when you look through the filter an advantage of this method is that you can place the filter in front of a pair of binoculars provided it s big enough to cover both sides or using a pair of filters with the magnification provided by the binoculars planetary transits of the sun can be observed for extremely powerful binoculars a 14 or 16 filter is advised for safety alternatively 5 lenses used for oxyacetylene cutting will also work for shorter

how to process your own colour images from hubble data,a great project for any lover of astronomy with even a hint of artistic ability is to process the raw images taken by the hubble space telescope hst into the coloured wonders we re used to seeing in print hubble data is presented in grey scale but with a free application download and any graphics editor you can turn the right combination of images in to either a close approximation of reality or a fantastical work of art,open the hubble legacy archive at http hla stsci edu click enter site locate the search box and the list of example searches below it you can search for objects by a number of criteria new general catalogue ngc numbers ipppssoot names proposal ids location and even names such as eagle nebula which are referenced against the nasa ipac extragalactic database ned 2 x research source or the simbad astronomical database 3 x research source when necessary for this guide enter ngc 604 in to the box which is the new general catalogue identification number for the the triangulum emission garren nebula click the advanced search link and select only the wfpc2 wide field and planetary camera 2 wfc3 wide field camera 3 and acs advanced camera for surveys under instruments these cameras give the best images for compositing into coloured final products change the data product to combined level 2 click search this should return 62 results locate the images tab to sort the data as thumbnails for easy viewing explore the results to get a feel for the data in the hla you can expand an image by clicking interactive display under a thumbnail locate the fourth image in the result for the search of ngc 604 above and you will find the file name hst_05237_02_wfpc2_f814w_wf below it the second last item in the name f814 is the filter used to take the image the item directly before it wfpc2 designates it was taken with the wide field and planetary camera 2 locate three separate filtered images to create your composite the three images will later be combined to each represent one of the three colours in an rgb red green blue image an example of a good set of filters would be wfpc2 f450w blue wfpc2 f555w green and wfpc2 f814w red to download your images right click the fits science link and save as or you can click it to add the items to your cart and download them in a batch by clicking the cart tab at the top of the search results to work with fits files you will need a small free application called fits liberator 4 x research source this can be downloaded from http www spacetelescope org projects fits_liberator download_v301 download and install either the windows or mac version depending on your operating system open fits liberator and navigate to one of the files downloaded earlier for now select hst_05237_02_wfpc2_f814w_wf_drz fits take a look around the software at the information and the different changes you can make play with some of the buttons and notice the changes to the image preview click the reset button on the left to return the image to its native form for now you are just going to use a simple stretch on the images before you save them find the stretch drop down which contains a number of pre sets and select log log x click save file and save the tiff file to an easily accessible location change the file name to match the filter for example save hst_05237_02_wfpc2_f814w_wf_drz fits as f814 tif do the same thing for the other two fits images open your first image in your editor ensuring the layer is named the same as the file for now use f814w tif and call the layer f814w place your second and third images above the first in their own layers again ensure the layers are named for the files in photoshop you can use file place to accomplish this easily be sure to rasterize the placed images select your top layer and zoom in on an area with a number of stars lower the opacity to between 50 and 60 so that you can see stars from the layer below look for stars that appear in both layers and nudge the top layer to make things line up return the top layer to 100 opacity then hide it by clicking the eye beside the layer name select the middle layer and lower the opacity to between 50 and 60 hold the shift key to select both the middle layer and the hidden top layer these images are now lined up so we want to move them together locate a star that appears in the middle and bottom layers as a reference to line things up return the middle layer to 100 opacity and unhide the top layer use the shift key to select all three layers use the selection tool to select an area of the image that you want to work with then use the crop tool to loose everything else you may need to rotate your selection or all three layers to get the region you want just remember that all three layers must remain selected so that you don t undo your work from above rotate the final product however you like select your top layer in photoshop and click ctrl a on your keyboard to select the entire canvas click ctrl c on your keyboard to copy the entire contents of the layer click file new or ctrl n to create a new image it should automatically set the size to the size of the image you copied the only thing you need to change is the bit depth of the image from 16bit to 8bit and the name of the image to the name of the layer you copied if you copied the layer called f814w call the image f814w paste the copied layer to the new image using ctrl v or by going to the edit menu and then paste do the same thing for the other two layers until you have three new images each with one layer at this point you can close the original three layer image flatten each image by right clicking the layer and selecting flatten on your third image open the channels window from the windows menu click the menu icon in the top right hand corner of the channels window and click merge channels if the merge option is greyed out your images are either not flattened or are not 8 bits you can fix this in the image mode menu select rgb for the mode and 3 for the number of channels and click ok set your lowest filter as blue the middle as green and the highest as red for this guide it should be red 814 green 555 blue 336 click ok you will be instantly presented with a colour image the outcome of the image will be affected by the filters chosen and the settings used in fits liberator use the level and curve adjustments on the various channels and the full image to reach a product you re happy with play with your results and you can make

how to view the sun,you ve probably heard that you shouldn t look at the sun directly this warning is absolutely justified as viewing the sun with your naked eyes can permanently damage your eyesight if you want to watch an eclipse or other solar phenomena you can do so safely by constructing a pinhole projector using a solar viewer or attaching a solar filter to a telescope,find two pieces of stiff paper for your pinhole projector one of the safest and simplest ways to view a solar eclipse is to project the image of the sun through a small hole in a piece of paper the resulting image is small but the shape of the sun can be seen clearly and your eyes are protected because you are not looking in the direction of the sun 1 x research source punch a very small hole in the center of the first sheet of paper use a pin or other small sharp object hold the first paper up to the light outside the light of the sun will shine through the hole position the second sheet of paper underneath the first one so that the circle of sunlight falls onto it you can adjust the distance between the two to alter the size and brightness of the image observe the image of the sun your circle is not just a dot of sunlight but a projected image of the sun 2 x research source during a solar eclipse the circle of projected sunlight will become a crescent as the moon obscures the sun locate a small telescope or a pair of binoculars these can be used to project an image of the sun onto a flat surface much like a pinhole projector because the lens is larger than a pinhole though the resulting image will be clearer and more detailed 3 x research source cover the lens of one side of binoculars use a piece of cardstock or the lens cap to cover the larger front lens on one side position the telescope or binoculars correctly the larger front lens should be pointing toward the sun so that the light shines through the smaller eyepiece lens onto the ground do not look through the lens at the sun use the device s shadow to help you aim correctly hold the device steady or position it on a tripod 4 x research source view the projected image of the sun the light from the sun will shine through the eyepiece onto the ground position a piece of white paper where the light falls for a clearer image shift the telescope or binoculars away from the sun every few minutes to avoid overheating the focused sunlight can damage the device if it is pointed at the sun for too long especially during a time other than a solar eclipse purchase eclipse goggles the simplest and cheapest way to view the sun through a filter is to locate a solar viewer or pair of paper glasses specially made for viewing a solar eclipse these glasses usually only cost a few dollars but be sure you purchase from a reputable vendor they should be compliant with the iso 12312 2 safety standard for such products 5 x research source check the lenses of the glasses for tears or scratches before use and do not use them if they are damaged use welder s goggles shade number 14 welder s glass is another affordable and widely available type of filter you can use to observe the sun with unaided eyes 6 x research source mount a filter on a telescope the only safe way to view the sun directly through a telescope looking through the eyepiece is to attach a solar filter over the larger front objective lens if your telescope has a finderscope cover it with a filter as well or cap it with the lens cap to avoid damage purchase a filter made specifically for your telescope these can be expensive but will result in the clearest viewing of the sun when used properly be sure the filter is an exact match for your brand and model of telescope and that it is mounted securely 7 x research source or purchase a sheet of solar filtering film to construct your own filter to attach to the front end of your telescope or binoculars 8 x research source follow the instructions on the package for mounting the material and be sure that the entire opening is covered do not look directly at the sun even for a short time it bears repeating looking directly at the sun can permanently and irreparably damage your eyes do not look at the sun through an improvised device sunglasses polarized 3d glasses cds space blankets and exposed film will not filter out the harmful wavelengths of sunlight and will not protect your eyes do not look at the sun through a telescope or binoculars without a solar filter attached viewing the sun through these devices even for a short time while positioning for use as a projector is more dangerous than looking at the sun with your naked eyes the lenses magnify the sun s light and project it directly into your eye be sure that any filter is correctly positioned before viewing the sun hold a solar viewer or eclipse glasses close to your face double check that telescope mounted filters are securely mounted,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to identify the stars,there are billions of stars in the night sky and stargazing is a very popular and enjoyable pastime getting started identifying the stars is easy most of the major stars like polaris or alpha centauri are part of constellations so learning the constellations will help you find those stars you can also use charts websites and apps to help you locate less famous or bright stars much easier with these tools you ll get started as an amateur stargazer in no time,find the north star by locating the big dipper the north star or polaris marks the north pole and makes star navigation possible start by finding the big dipper a large part of the ursa major constellation that looks like a pot this is to the north follow the handle of the pot until it bends and move your eyes to the opposite side from where the handle bends this takes you to the little dipper follow the handle to the end to find the north star 1 x research source you can only see the north star if you re in the northern hemisphere if you re in the southern hemisphere you can navigate by finding the south pole instead with the southern cross constellation the big dipper is always visible if you re above 41 degrees north which is above the northern half of the us below that it sinks below the horizon and is only visible around dawn locate alpha centauri with the centaurus constellation alpha centauri is the closest star to earth so it s exciting to locate in the southern hemisphere start by finding the southern cross constellation a collection of 4 bright stars that make a distinctive cross marking the south pole as the name suggests it s in the south draw an imaginary line connecting the 2 stars that are a shorter distance apart continue that line out from the brighter star of the 2 and stop when you come across another large bright star on the side of the southern cross this is alpha centauri 2 x research source alpha centauri is very far south in the night sky so it s invisible from most parts of the northern hemisphere you could spot it sometimes in early may however if you live near the equator use the orion constellation to find sirius the orion constellation appears slightly south if you re in the northern hemisphere and high to the north if you re in the southern hemisphere it s easy to locate by finding the 3 medium brightness stars that make a straight line forming the constellation s belt find the bow section of the constellation by locating the 4 stars that make a curved line then trace a straight line down from the side of orion s belt opposite from the bow to find sirius 3 x research source sirius is the brightest star in the night sky so you may not even need to use constellations to find it orion is easy to locate because it s bright at all times even if you live in a city with a lot of light pollution you should have no trouble finding it it s highest in the sky in the winter but you can also find it lower near the horizon in the summer months look straight down from sirius to find canopus canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky and it s easy to find once you locate sirius imagine a line extending straight down from sirius just right of that line slightly above the horizon is canopus 4 x research source canopus has a slightly red tint because it s close to the horizon spot rigel in the lower right side of orion rigel is another one of the brightest stars in the night sky and the brightest in the orion constellation once you locate orion look down and to the right of orion s belt this is where orion s right foot would be and it s where rigel sits in the constellation 5 x research source rigel also has a slightly blue purple tint making it easier to spot within orion rigel is fun to identify because many science fiction movies and shows like star trek use that name for places or characters find vega with the lyra constellation vega is a bright blue star that forms the base of the lyra constellation lyra is almost always straight up in the night sky if you re in the northern hemisphere but it s most visible to the north in the summer months 4 stars make a box leading to a straight line for the base the middle star on the base is vega 6 x research source vega is also very bright so it s possible to spot it without the constellation look north for its blue tint to help you locate it use a star chart to locate other stars and constellations a star chart is a paper map of the night sky tailored to your hemisphere and the season some are adjustable and you can slide the rim to match different times of year get a star chart for the current season that you re in then orient the chart to the direction you re looking and the time of day it is spin the outer rim of the chart to adjust it to the time of day hold it up to the sky when it s oriented to map out the other stars and constellations 7 x research source there are star charts for the northern and southern hemispheres make sure you get the right one for where you live you can buy cheap star charts online you can also print free ones off of some websites read star atlases to get more familiar with the night sky learning more about the stars will help you locate and identify more of them you ll know which directions to look what time of year is best for certain stars and how to differentiate stars from planets this is all valuable information for stargazing so read as many books and atlases as you can to improve your skills 8 x research source try to use resources from the national parks service nasa national geographic and norton all produce quality information and atlases you can find most of these books at the library so there s no need to spend a lot of money download stargazing apps to get interactive views of your night sky apps are helpful if you don t have a paper star chart or prefer to use your phone instead search the app store for astronomy or stargazing apps to use at night look for one with a good star locator so your can identify different stars 9 x research source stargazing apps range from basic star charts to programs that map the entire sky when you hold the phone up pick one that has features you want if they re free try downloading a few and see which you like best some well known free apps are starchart and the nasa app other ones like skysafari starmap and pocket universe are more powerful but cost a few dollars to download visit a star mapping website to plan your stargazing search for star mapping sites online and type in your location these websites will then produce an image of what the night sky looks like above you use this chart to locate and identify the different stars that you ll see in the night sky 10 x research source popular websites are in the sky org earthsky org and stargazing net the nasa and national geographic websites also have good stargazing information and articles some websites let you print star maps after typing in all of your information that way you ll have a physical copy to take with you when you go stargazing,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to use an astrolabe,when you need to know what time it is chances are you look at your phone but before technology people used an astrolabe an ancient astronomical instrument that maps the night sky to determine facts like the hour of the day or when the sun will rise if you get your hands on an astrolabe you can not only use it to figure out the time you can also find where different stars and constellations will be in the sky on a particular date happy stargazing,move the alidade onto the calendar date to get the zodiac date use either the current date or a future date that you want to know the star forecast for align the alidade with the date and find the corresponding zodiac date that it points to 1 x research source the dates are found on the back of the astrolabe and are written around the circle flip the astrolabe over and align the rule with the zodiac date on the rete this will give you the position of the sun and the stars for that date make sure that the rule is perfectly placed on top of the date so you have an accurate reading 3 x research source the ecliptic shows the path of the sun through the sky and is grouped by zodiac signs note that the sun moves around the ecliptic counter clockwise move the rule and rete together to line up with the time of night find the time along the outer edge of the astrolabe when you want to view the stars rotate the intersection point of the rule and rete so that it points towards that time 4 x research source for example if you want to check what will be in the sky at 10 30 p m align the rule and rete halfway between x and xi look at the stars above the horizon line to determine their location anything located above the horizon line on the plate of the astrolabe will be visible on the date and time that you chose the concentric rings tell you how high in the sky each star will be if a star is at the center of the rings which is known as the zenith for instance it means that the star is directly overhead 5 x research source the farther out from the zenith that the stars are the lower in the sky they ll be to know which direction to look in use the compass markings on the plate ese means the star or constellation will be located in the east southeast section of the sky you won t be able to see any of the stars that are below the horizon line hold the astrolabe at the top and align the alidade with the north star grasp the ring so that the astrolabe hangs down and turn the alidade so that it points directly towards the north star in the sky the alidade is the bar that rotates on the back of the astrolabe 6 x research source if your astrolabe doesn t have a ring you can identify the top by looking for the xii some alidades are hollow straws if yours has one like this line it up by looking through one end of the straw and rotating it until you can see the north star through the other end look at the measurement on the rim where the alidade is pointing once you ve aligned the alidade find the number that it intersects on the outer rim of the astrolabe this is known as the zenith angle which is measured in degrees and is the angle between the star and an imaginary line that goes straight up from the earth 8 x research source make sure you have the alidade lined up as accurately as possible even the slightest bit to the left or right can throw off your reading it might be easier to have a friend look at the measurement while you hold the alidade in place subtract the zenith angle from 90 to get the latitude when you calculate 90 minus the zenith angle you get the elevation angle which is the angle between the north star and the horizon this is also equal to the latitude of where you re standing 9 x research source for example if you were standing at the north pole the north star would be directly overhead making your zenith angle equal 0 subtract that from 90 and you get 90 which is the latitude of the north pole hold the astrolabe by the ring at the top so it hangs down using the astrolabe any other way will distort your readings the very top of the astrolabe is where the xii is marked on the outer rim 10 x research source if there s no ring on your astrolabe pinch the top to hold it rightside up adjust the alidade to point at the sun to find the altitude the alidade is the rotating bar on the back of the astrolabe turn it until it s angled directly towards the sun then look at the angle measurement that the alidade is now sitting on top of along the rim of the astrolabe that number is the sun s altitude 11 x research source if the angle reading is 40 for example it means the sun s altitude is 40 degrees never look directly into the sun when doing this protect your eyes with sunglasses whenever you re looking near the sun too it can help to have a friend hold the astrolabe while you take the reading determine the zodiac date by lining up the alidade with the calendar date on the back of the astrolabe you ll find both the civil calendar dates and the zodiac dates place the alidade over the current date to find the corresponding zodiac one 12 x research source a zodiac date looks similar to a calendar date but uses a sign instead of a month for instance the zodiac date of march 13 is pisces 10 align the rule with the correct zodiac date on the front of the astrolabe the zodiac dates are located on the outside edge of the rete which is the top plate on the front of the astrolabe after turning the instrument over move the rule so that it s on top of the zodiac date you just found 13 x research source the ring around the rete where the zodiac dates are is also known as the ecliptic circle rotate the rule and rete together lining them up with the sun s altitude you ll find the altitude measurements on the tympan which is the base plate of the astrolabe line up the intersection point of the rule and rete with the altitude you measured 14 x research source the altitudes are written on the tympan as degrees find the time where the opposite end of the rule is pointing once you have the rule and rete aligned properly look at the opposite end of the rule it will be resting over the time on the outermost rim of the astrolabe 15 x research source the numbers around the outside edge of the astrolabe are arranged just like a clock from 1 to 12 they re written in roman numerals for instance if the end of the rule is pointing halfway between vii and viii the time is 7 30,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to use orion to find other constellations,constellations are hard to find if you re a novice who s never used a star map before but a better idea is to star hop use one or two constellations with bright stars and trace paths to other parts of the sky orion with seven bright stars can serve as your guide for a sky tour here are some paths to other constellations that you can follow when stargazing directions are written for the northern hemisphere only,know where orion is if you have no clue where it is use star charts such as david levy s a guide to sky watching google sky map is also an excellent resource for the novice note that orion is not visible around june it is visible in the morning from july to mid december all night in late december and in the evening from january to may memorize the corner stars in orion betelgeuse is in the top left and glows reddish orange it also fluctuates in brightness over the course of several years to its right bellatrix the amazon star is a pale blue below bellatrix is rigel a blue super giant star and the brightest in orion the dimmest star is saiph to the left of rigel and below betelgeuse between all of these stars is orion s belt the three bright stars in a row 1 x research source underneath orion s belt is his sword which contains the orion nebula this is a good target for binoculars or a small telescope time to start navigating start with the two dimmest corner stars bellatrix and saiph follow them up to encounter aldebaran the brightest star in taurus and the pleiades a bright star cluster 2 x research source follow them down to reach beta canis majoris and adhara to the left of these stars is the sky s brightest star sirius the sun is actually the brightest for this one you can also follow orion s belt right and left respectively continue following saiph and bellatrix and you will encounter perseus the hero from greek mythology in perseus is algol one of a class of eclipsing variable stars and the old faithful of the winter sky every 2 8 days its larger dimmer companion obscures the brighter companion leading to a sudden dimming that lasts for a few hours follow rigel and betelgeuse the two brightest stars in orion up to enter gemini and view its two brightest stars castor and pollux fun fact pollux is the brightest star with a confirmed planet don t try to use a telescope to look for it though it s not visible castor is a sextuple star system but only 3 can be seen in a telescope one of these stars yy geminorium is a variable 3 x research source tracing from bellatrix to betelgeuse leads to canis minor shining with the bright stars procyon and gomeisa procyon has a white dwarf companion procyon b which can be seen in a large telescope going backwards leads to aries the ram just under it is the dim constellation of cetus omicron ceti known as mira is a long period red giant variable it changes from magnitude 8 invisible to magnitude 2 one of the brightest stars in the sky over 11 months draw an imaginary line from rigel to bellatrix and you will crash into capella the brightest star in the constellation auriga auriga rides taurus the bull capella is the highest first magnitude star and is visible year round from the northern us after you have found these stars use them to find more constellations a good set of star charts or google sky map will help you out here,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a simple solar viewer,you have probably been told never to look directly at the sun but that begs the question how do you study it the sun is very intense and can do serious damage to your eyes if you gaze at it for even a moment luckily astronomers have a few tricks for getting around this the most common way is to use a solar viewer which allows you to see the sun s image on a piece of paper or cardboard they are easy and inexpensive to make and use and they give you the ability to safely study the sun,cut a 1 inch 2 5 cm square in a cardboard box cut into the short side of a cardboard box this way the light shining through the hole can travel the length of the box to the other side letting the light travel the length of the box will enlarge the image you should use a box that is no less than 6 feet 1 8 m long to produce a clear viewable image 1 x research source if you do not have a cardboard box that is 6 feet 1 8 m long you can cut smaller pieces of cardboard and tape or glue them together to make a box that is the appropriate length make sure the pieces are joined completely and that no light shines through the places where they are connected cover the square with aluminum foil tape a piece of aluminum foil over the hole in the box aluminum foil will block excess light from shining through the hole you created be sure that the foil is pulled tight so that it is smooth 2 x research source make a small hole in the foil use a toothpick or a needle to prick a hole in the center of the aluminum foil this will allow just a small amount of light to be focused through the hole and projected at the other end of the box this will provide an image of the sun that is safe to look at 3 x research source tape up your screen to improve the quality of your image you can project it on a white screen the easiest way to do this is to take blank white paper and tape it at the end of the viewer furthest from the hole one sheet of paper is sufficient 4 x research source aim the pinhole at the sun in order for your viewer to capture the an image of the sun you have to aim it avoid looking at the sun to aim the viewer instead point the viewer in the general direction of the sun and then move it around slowly until you see the sun on your screen 5 x research source view the image of the sun once you have the sun on your screen it is safe to look at you do not need any safety glasses or other special equipment the image is much less intense than actually looking at the sun 6 x research source be safe you should never look directly at the sun even doing so briefly can damage your eyes you have to use a solar viewer to project the image or buy special glasses and or telescopes that filter out enough light to be safe 7 x research source sunglasses will not protect your eyes from the sun only special filtered lenses will be safe watch for patterns if you are serious about studying the sun you can watch for patterns look for sunspots in your image they will show up as dimmer spots on the image observe the sunspots over time and see how they move 8 x research source to make accurate comparisons you should observe the sun from the same place every time brush up on your math skills you can use some basic measurements of your image and viewer to find interesting facts about the sun this is because the image you are viewing is a scaled down image of the sun even though it s smaller it is proportional to the actual sun for example you can find the diameter of the sun by following these steps 9 x research source divide the diameter of the image by the distance from the pinhole the length of the box multiply that answer by the distance between the earth and sun approximately 150 000 000 kilometers or 93 000 000 miles find other ways to watch the sun you can watch the sun without a specially made solar viewer find a tree or other object that provides shade if there are any holes or spaces in the object you can study the spots of sun that shine through you can also hold your hands up and study the sunlight that shines through the spaces between your fingers put white paper or cardboard under whatever you are using to view the sunlight and look at the image of the sun on the paper or cardboard keep in mind that you should never look directly at the sun,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to view capricornus,the night sky is filled with constellations or groups of stars that represent characters or objects one such constellation is capricornus the sea goat this strange mythical creature can be spotted in the night sky if you know when and where to look just be sure that you also know which group of stars you are seeking not surprisingly it bears little resemblance to a sea goat,seek capricornus in fall and summer from the northern hemisphere as the earth moves through its orbit different parts of the sky will be visible since the seasons are dependent upon the orbit you can determine which constellations will be visible based on the seasons months of the year capricornus is visible roughly from july through november 1 x research source view capricornus in winter and spring from the southern hemisphere if you are in the southern hemisphere the seasons occur at in different months that means that july through november corresponds to the winter and spring seasons these same months are when you should look for capricornus in the southern hemisphere 2 x research source learn the times that capricornus is at its peak capricornus peaks at different times depending on the month it is best seen in the september sky in the early evening earlier in the year you will have to wait up later to see the sea goat 3 x research source look to the south in the northern hemisphere when gazing up at the sky it is easy to be overwhelmed by the number of stars narrow your view to just the stars you can see when facing south this southern sky is where you will find the sea goat capricornus 4 x research source set your gaze north from the southern hemisphere the direction of the capricornus also changes if you live in the southern hemisphere in this case you would look to the northern sky not the southern sky again it helps to ignore the rest of the sky if you are looking for just one constellation 5 x research source familiarize yourself with the sea capricornus is found in the part of the sky called the sea the sea is in the southern portion of the sky northern from the southern hemisphere it is home to several water related constellations such as aquarius pisces and cetus knowing this area and these constellations can help you find capricornus 6 x research source if you are familiar with the summer triangle constellation you can draw a straight line from one of its points the star vega through a second point the star altair and straight to capricornus search for a triangular shape in the sky though capricornus has several points that are a little jagged its overall shape resembles a rough triangle one tip of the triangle appears to be pointing straight down toward the earth the other two points are pointing off into the sky 7 x research source in the southern hemisphere the constellation appears upside down notice the sea goat s horns the horns of the sea goat are found above below in the southern hemisphere one of the points of the triangle these horns are a cluster of stars that appear to make two points this gives the appearance that the sea goat has a head and horns just like a normal goat 8 x research source learn the prominent stars in the constellation knowing the main stars in any constellation can help you find it you can look these stars up on the internet or ask an experienced astronomer some of the main stars in capricornus are 9 x research source alpha capricorn two different stars dabih also known as beta capricorni nashira or gamma capricorni deneb algedi delta capricorni,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to observe constellations by area,observing the constellations makes for a great hobby that can even lead to a career as an astronomer or to another space related career this article provides some of the basics for finding constellations,be aware that there are sky charts or maps that indicate the location of each constellation for the purposes of map making the celestial sphere is divided into six sections consisting of the northern and southern polar regions and four equatorial areas these refer to the locations where you can view the sky section if you re keen on seeing a certain constellation but you don t live where you can see it you ll need to plan a grand expedition for example stars that can be seen in the far northern latitudes cannot be seen in the far southern latitudes and vice versa because they do not rise above the horizon some constellations such as orion can be seen across most of the inhabited world sky maps look flat to us but that is so that they can fit inside a flat book in reality the sky is like a dome note that there are 88 officially recognized constellations most amateur astronomers tend to look for those constellations that have notable features or recognizable star patterns what you will be able to see when looking in a particular constellation not only depends on your geographic location but also on your equipment and local light pollution stars with a magnitude 6 5 and greater can usually be seen with the naked eye or with standard binoculars you can also look for star clusters nebulae differently colored stars and galaxies many constellations have been known for thousands of years in the time of ancient greece 48 constellations were noted by ptolemy a greek astronomer from here look for the following constellations ursa minor ursa major draco cygnus bootes canes venatici camelopardalis lynx cepheus cassiopeia andromeda perseus auriga lacerta delphinus look for polaris this is also known as the pole star or the north star owing to the fact that earth s axis is aligned to a point near this star it appears to us that this star stays in the same spot this has been useful for navigators throughout history from here look for the following constellations phoenix pavo telescopium grus indus tucana hydrus pictor horologium reticulum octans centaurus chamaeleon mensa carina vela apus eridanus crux dorado circinus triangulum australe musca view the constellations for this sky chart during september october and november look for the following constellations from this chart perseus andromeda cassiopeia lacerta cygnus triangulum cetus sculptor fornax phoenix eridanus piscis austrinus aquarius grus microscorpium delphinus vulpecula capricornus indus view the constellations for this sky chart during june july august and september look for the following constellations from this chart cygnus draco lyra hercules corona borealis bootes serpens caput vulpecula sagitta delphinus aquarius capricornius sagittarius corona australis microscorpium ara norma lupus telescopium indus libra virgo ophiuchus serpens cauda scorpius scutum aquila view the constellations for this sky chart during march april and may look for the following constellations from this chart ursa major canes venatici coma bernices leo minor lynx boötes virgo crater corvus libra centaurus lupus hydra antlia vela pyxis sextans leo look for stars in boötes you ll find arcturus which has a red coloring and is very bright in the virgo constellation you ll find spica which has a blue color leo is probably the most well known constellation view the constellations for this sky chart during december january and february look for the following constellations from this chart auriga lynx orion perseus eridanus fornax columba lepus canis major puppis hydra pyxis taurus cetus gemini monoceros canis minor cancer aries horologium caelum pictor look for the bright stars this part of the night sky contains a lot of the bright stars making it a good place to look especially if you re just learning to spot the constellations in particular look for the orion constellation which contains a line of three very bright stars that form orion s belt other bright stars include aldebaran in the taurus constellation and the pleiades the seven sisters known as the m45 star cluster the canis major constellation has sirius the dog star which is the brightest star in our night sky,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to measure the distance to a galaxy,with the advent of internet access to scientific papers and research plus some know how of relativity it is now remarkably easy to measure with significant accuracy the distance to spiral galaxies without using luminosity or red shift,find a clear digital photograph of the galaxy whose distance you wish to measure these are available on the ned or mast dss websites save the photo as a negative and print it on a printer although this can be done on a computer screen using gimp draw a line along the major axis of the galaxy the spiral galaxy will have spiral arms which will cross the line you have drawn at regular intervals make a measure of the distance between these intervals you may use a ruler on a printed out photo and take an average or use the measuring device in gimp or use matlab to extract the pixels along the major axis and apply a fast fourier transform onto the extracted set of pixels if you are a geek find the particular width in arc minutes of the photograph which you will have used when selecting it from ned or mast dss the photo will also have its width given in pixels or if you have used a ruler you can measure the width of the photo in inches or centimeters the purpose of this is to convert the measured interval length between spiral arms along the major axis of the galaxy into arc minutes it is important to measure or determine this interval in arc minutes and with a little algebra this is very easy to do you do not have to be a geek to do it find out how fast the galaxy is spinning luckily a vast number of galaxies have had their rotation speeds measured and these can be found online look for galactic rotation profiles or rotation curves and find one for your galaxy there is a way to find out how fast a galaxy is spinning using line widths but that is not covered here when and if you find your galaxy s rotation profile it will be a graph of rotation velocity vs radial distance from the centre of the galaxy the velocity of rotation will flatten out to some maximum velocity almost always given in kilometers per second kps you will need to measure this maximum rotational velocity as best you can in kps ignore every thing about dark matter it is completely irrelevant multiply the interval measure in arc minutes times the maximum velocity of rotation measure in kps divide 3 12e9 by the result that is the distance to the galaxy in parsecs if you multiply that distance by 3 26 that is the distance in light years,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to catch a falling star,you might ask what what in the whole wide world do you mean to catch a falling star well to answer the question you first have to know how to watch a falling star rise again only then will you be able to catch a falling star so the real purpose of this article is to try to explain how to watch a falling star rise again to the level of becoming yet another star stars they are wondrous things that glow and twinkle in the night sky silently observing all that we think say and do to catch the falling stars you may need a little extra equipment and gadgetry but a lot of these steps can be taken by simply observing the current ways and means we already have to see into the universe including your very own eyes,dress comfortably and take at least 30 minutes or so out of your evening if you are getting ready to rest take a chair outside and wear your evening clothes the exception to this is if you are in a public place in that case you will want to still dress comfortably and find a place to sit where you can see the night sky be aware of the time you want to be sure to be prepared and do it no sooner than an hour after sunset time listen to your local radio station or tv or find the information in your newspaper if you want very accurate information a world clock time zone website will help so you can easily find the correct time here s a link to the worldclocktimeserver website out of the many accurate time servers that exist check your local time against the world clock to ensure your watch is set right so you can watch the star find out what time the sun sets in your area check this website to find your local sunset and sundown times please note that these are only two websites out of the very many in cyberspace that you can use to get the same information but for the purposes of this article it should only be limited to one for the correct time and one to find the sunset and sunrise information check the weather outside go outside and look up while panning your eyes across the top of the horizon can you physically see clouds or does it look gray or white if so this is not a good night to see or watch the stars without a strong telescope that can peer out past the clouds such as the hubble telescope because the weather is too cloudy if it s not crystal clear there are other space telescopes besides hubble but it s the most talked about space telescope at this time can you see stars twinkling in the beautiful night sky wait until it s a really clear night then go outside and find a dark place to view the sky it could be your backyard a park or even just a quiet place in your mind tilt your head straight up and stop close your eyes and count to 10 very slowly open your eyes very slowly and gaze into the universe don t you wonder how it got there look at all the constellations and far away stars and planets yes some planets and stars are so far away that you can t even see them the ones you cannot yet see are the falling stars,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to classify stars,every star is different some are big some small some hot some cold they can be blue or yellow or red stellar classification allows you to describe a star in simple terms,determine the star s colour colour serves as a rough guide to temperature currently there are ten colours each with an associated temperature range o class stars are blue uv b class are blue white a class white f yellow white g yellow k orange and m red the other three classes are infrared l class appear very deep red in visual light their spectra show alkali metals and metal hydrides t class are cooler than l class their spectra show methane y class are the coolest of all and apply only to brown dwarves their spectra are different to t and l class but there is no definite definition put a number after the letter to show precise temperature within each colour there are ten temperature bands 0 9 with 0 being hottest thus a0 is hotter than a5 which is hotter than a9 which is hotter than f0 as an example determine the star s size a roman numeral indicating the star s size is added after the temperature designation 0 or ia indicates a hypergiant star ia iab and ib represent supergiants bright medium dim ii is bright giants iii giants iv sub giants v main sequence stars the part of a stars life that it spends the most time going through and vi is sub dwarfs a prefix of d indicates a white dwarf star examples da7 white dwarf f5ia yellow hypergiant g2v yellow main sequence star the sun is g2v use a prism to split the star s light this will give you a range of colours called a spectrum like what you get when you shine a torch through a prism the spectrum of a star should have dark lines on it these are absorption lines compare the star s spectrum to a database a good astronomical database should give a typical spectrum for each star type this is why the type is sometimes called the spectral class determine the proportion of metals elements other than hydrogen and helium in a star stars with greater than 1 metals are termed metal rich and are part of something called population i stars with about 0 1 metals are termed metal poor and are part of population ii population ii stars formed earlier in the universe when less metals had been formed keep your eyes open for stars with no metals these stars population iii are expected to have been born just after the big bang when the only elements were hydrogen and helium and metals did not exist as of yet these stars are only theoretical but people are looking very hard for them determine if the star is variable not all stars are but some are and can be very useful determine if it is an eclipsing binary eclipsing binaries like algol in perseus are two stars orbiting each other determine the amplitude and period of the variation compare these to the characteristics of known variable types to determine the type of variable star for example cepheid variables have periods of days to months and amplitudes of up to 2 magnitudes whereas delta scuti variables have periods of less than 8 hours and amplitudes of less than 0 9 magnitudes,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to observe variable stars,variable stars are as the name suggests stars that vary in brightness there are several different mechanisms as to how this happens variable stars can be very interesting to observe and this is one of the areas where amateur astronomy can make significant contributions,go out stargazing it sounds obvious but this will be easier if you go out a few times and familiarise yourself with the stars and constellations identify a star that you want to observe decent variable stars have been studied for hundreds of years algol mira and delta cephei δ cep are all good if common choices for this article we re going to be observing δ cep find a couple of non variable stars guide stars near your star this works with one but two is better and three or more if possible is even better these stars should be of a similar brightness to the star you are observing for δ cep you can use ζ cep which is slightly brighter than δ cep at max brightness and ε cep which is slightly brighter than δ cep at min brightness compare how bright the variable star is to the guide stars every night you should see it change brightness over time δ cep changes on a constant 5 37 day period get yourself a small notebook and a pencil if you need a flashlight place a red filter over the top of the lens when the light shines through using a flashlight without doing this will ruin your night vision and make observation of these stars seem impossible at the top write down the name of the star you are observing if you want write down it s co ordinates and how much it is meant to vary by you can find the magnitudes quite easily by searching for the star on wikipedia underneath write down your guide stars again you can write down their positions and brightness every night record how bright your target star is compared to the guide stars write down the date and time as well so you know when you took the observation try drawing a light curve this is a graph of how your star varies over time a light curve can help you to identify what type of variable star you are observing if your star has regular variations it can help you predict how bright it is going to be on the next night prepare to take lots of observations δ cep varies through visible brightness over 5 37 days so it is quite easy to observe mira varies on a 332 day period and most of the time it requires a telescope to see so it requires drastically more observations understand the main types of variable star these types generally have regular and predictable variations cepheid variables have well defined stable periods and amplitudes they oscillate between fixed maxima and minima and take a fixed amount of time to do it cepheids can have periods between 1 and 50 days they have something called a period luminosity relationship how long it takes to complete one cycle depends on the intrinsic brightness of the star this makes it possible to calculate how far away the star is rr lyrae variables are similar to cepheids but they are dimmer and have smaller periods and amplitudes they follow a period luminosity relationship in the infrared not in visible light mira variables are red in colour and have long periods over 100 days and very large variations the maxima and minima also vary so one cycle can be slightly brighter or dimmer than another mira variables are typically very dim and need a telescope to see algol variables are a type of binary star on occasion the dimmer star eclipses the brighter one causing the brightness to drop for a short period slow irregular variables as the name suggests vary slowly and irregularly these stars don t have a period they are typically large red stars at the end of their life which causes them to flicker irregularly tx piscium is a slow irregular variable understand the rarer types of variable stars these typically need a telescope or some binoculars to see also they don t usually vary all the time but spend most of their time at one brightness and rarely and unpredictably change in brightness they are sometimes known as a whole as eruptive variables flare stars spend most of their time at a dim brightness and occasionally for a few minutes jump up in brightness it is believed that this is caused by a similar mechanism to solar flares proxima centauri and barnard s star are flare stars recurrent novae are similar to flare stars but they have much greater jumps in brightness and flare ups are a lot rarer t coronae borealis the blaze star is a recurrent nova it has been seen to flare twice once in 1886 and once in 1946 some activity was seen in 2016 that suggests it may flare again soon r coronae borealis variables spend most of their time at maximum brightness at unpredictable intervals their brightness plummets then slowly works its way back up this is caused by carbon dust forming into soot blotting out the light from the star supernovae are rare transient events caused by exploding stars supernovae are incredibly bright but seeing one with the naked eye can be a once in a lifetime event,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a moon phases chart,it takes the moon roughly 29 5 days to orbit the earth during its orbit different portions of the moon are visible these portions are referred to as moon phases since the moon s orbit is a predictable pattern it is possible to chart the phases of the moon this can be a great way to study the moon in depth or to introduce children to the cycles of the moon,make a 2d chart or a 3d chart use white construction paper cut in circles and color in the moon phases with markers or use halves of styrofoam balls glued to posterboard to make a 3d representation color in the foam balls with a black marker to show the waxing and waning of the moon phases know the phases of the moon this is vital to being able to create an accurate chart there are eight main phases of the moon each lasting roughly 3 5 days the phase of the moon depends upon the way in which the moon is positioned in relation to the sun and earth at any given time the eight phases are 1 x research source new moon waxing crescent first quarter waxing gibbous full moon waning gibbous last quarter waning crescent place earth in the center of your chart different positions of the moon relative to the earth and sun produce the visible phases of the moon the moon phases chart is designed to describe the visibility of the moon at different points as it orbits the earth by placing earth in the center of your chart you keep this concept in perspective 2 x research source place the sun on your chart the sun is typically placed on the right side of the chart this is important because the moon phase depends upon the moon s relation to both the earth and the sun if you place the sun to the left of the earth you would have to move all of the moon phases to match this new position 3 x research source the relationship of these three bodies is important but the actual determination of right or left side is arbitrary the earth orbits the sun and the sun is never at a stationary left or right in relation to the earth start with the new moon the new moon occurs when the moon is directly between the earth and the sun draw or fasten a new moon all dark shadowed directly between the earth and sun 4 x research source in astrology the new moon symbolizes birth or new beginnings it is thought to be a good time to start a new project 5 x research source place the waxing crescent from the point of the new moon move counterclockwise by 45 degrees to draw or place the waxing crescent this moon phase occurs when the moon has moved through roughly ⅛ of its orbit less than three days after the new moon at this point in the orbit there is a sliver of the moon that is lit by the sun s light and visible to the side of the earth experiencing night pointing away from the sun 6 x research source the crescent phase is often associated with struggle and growth in astrology it is thought to be a good time to take opportunities 7 x research source attach the first quarter move counterclockwise 90 degrees from the new moon or 45 degrees from the waxing crescent to place or draw the first quarter moon when the moon appears as a half circle in the sky this is known as a quarter moon because the moon has moved through ¼ of its orbit this moon phase can be observed around seven to ten days into the moon s cycle 8 x research source astrological themes surrounding the first quarter phase are action and expression it is considered a good time to take the first steps to communicate your goals and achieve them 9 x research source pin the waxing gibbous move another 45 degrees counterclockwise 135 degrees from the new moon to place the waxing gibbous during this phase the moon moves closer and closer to being a full circle in the sky the waxing gibbous is observed from roughly eleven to fourteen days into the moon cycle 10 x research source during the waxing gibbous phase astrologists suggest that you focus on analyzing the results of the actions that you initiated in the first quarter phase start with a full moon the full moon is the climax of the waxing phases it is also the beginning of the waning phases as the moon continues its orbit it will become less and less visible the placement of the full moon on your chart should be 180 degrees from the new moon straight across from the new moon on the other side of the earth 11 x research source astrologically the full moon represents illumination during this phase it is thought that one will have a clear view of their previous actions so that they can make appropriate adjustments 12 x research source attach the waning gibbous the waning gibbous should be placed 45 degrees counterclockwise with respect to the full moon stages of the waning gibbous appear to be inverted from stages of the waxing gibbous the parts of the moon that were dark at a given phase of the waxing gibbous will be light at a similar phase of the waning gibbous and vice versa 13 x research source in astrology the waning gibbous is also referred to as the disseminating moon it is considered a time to reflect upon any changes made during the full moon phase 14 x research source place the third quarter moon the third quarter moon should be placed 90 degrees counterclockwise from the full moon the third quarter moon appears as the inverse of the first quarter moon this phase marks the point at which the moon has traveled through ¾ of its orbit 15 x research source the third quarter moon or last quarter moon is considered a time for revising and cleansing by astrologists it is thought to be the time to bring closure to projects started during the new moon phase 16 x research source pin the waning crescent the waning crescent is the last moon phase in the cycle it should be placed on the chart 135 degrees counterclockwise from the full moon 45 degrees counterclockwise from the waning gibbous this will complete a circle around the earth with eight different points representing the eight moon phases 17 x research source in astrology the waning crescent is also known as the balsamic moon this is considered a time to let go and release any things that do not pertain to the next moon cycle provide explanations below the chart explain each moon phase in a caption this way anyone reading the chart can immediately work out which phase of the moon they are looking at and why it is named that for example new moon this is the beginning of the moon phases when the moon is hidden from sight waxing crescent this is the sliver of a crescent when the moon begins to be visible first quarter appears as a half circle in the sky waxing gibbous more than half of a circle is illuminated as the moon moves toward a full moon full moon the entire moon appears lit up by the sun so you can see a whole circle waxing gibbous the illumination of the moon starts to shrink again last quarter appears as a half circle in the sky waning crescent the last phase of the moon as it becomes less and less visible,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make and use star charts,star charts have been in use since antiquity usually they are drawn as circles with the pole in the middle and the equator near the edge,get the stuff you need you will need a large piece of paper a set of giant compasses a 30 cm or larger ruler a protractor a pencil and an eraser the co ordinates of the stars that you want on your chart available online draw a big circle if your paper is large enough and i m assuming it is draw a circle with a radius of one foot draw concentric circles the circles should have radii of 1 inch 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 inches and the centres should be in the same place as the centre of the big circle draw radii from the centre of the circle draw six radii at 0 degrees 60 120 180 240 and 300 degrees draw six radii from the edge of the 1 inch circle to the edge of the one foot circle at 30 degrees 90 150 210 270 and 330 degrees draw twelve radii from the edge of the 2 inch circle to the edge of the one foot circle at 15 degrees 45 75 105 135 165 195 225 255 285 315 and 345 degrees mark on the co ordinates where the 0 degree radius meets the one foot circle write 0h going clockwise anticlockwise if you are mapping the southern hemisphere the other radius circle meeting points are 1h 2h 3h and so on up to 23h these are now the names of the radii e g the 15h radius at the point where the radii meet in the middle write 90 if you re mapping the northern hemisphere write 90 southern hemisphere 90 moving outwards label the circles as 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 and the outer circle should be 30 if you re mapping the southern hemisphere change to and to the co ordinates of stars are given as declination in degrees and right ascension in hours you can find the co ordinates on the internet to plot a star start at the middle move outwards along the 0h radius until you are at the correct declination then move clockwise until you are at the correct right ascension draw a dot to mark the star you may wish to connect the stars in each constellation so that you can see the patterns if you have enough space after plotting the stars you can write information about each one next to it if you can write the star s magnitude how bright it is name and designation now it s time to use your star chart firstly you need to find some stars that you know so you can find them on your chart for northerners i d recommend the big dipper or cassiopeia for southerners i d recommend carina or centaurus once you ve found where you are on the chart it will show you where other stars are in relation to the ones you ve found,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a sun chart,making a sun chart is a very important step to take before planting your first garden it allows you to measure how much sunlight certain areas of your yard get each day this is important because plants and vegetables have specific requirements for the amount of sunlight and shade they need each day using a sun chart helps you diagram the sun and plant the right vegetables in your garden so they can thrive,gather the necessary materials to make this type of sun chart you will need a piece of paper a pen pencil three different colored pencils crayons markers red yellow and blue and a leisurely day where you can make regular observations of your yard choose a sunny day for observation in order to make the most accurate sun chart you can you want to make your observations on a sunny day the time of year is also an important factor your yard will have more overall sunlight during the summer than during the fall for maximum sun exposure choose a sunny summer day you can repeat this sun chart exercise during the spring fall and winter if you want an idea of how much sun your garden gets throughout the year 1 x research source sketch a map of your yard draw a basic map of the area that you want to use for gardening include the relative locations of anything large enough to cast a shadow such as buildings fences and trees 2 x research source scale is not important mark out the basic area of where you want to plant your garden as well record observations of the sun at 9 00 am in yellow colored pencil at 9 00 am look out at your yard and draw yellow lines marking out the area of the yard that is currently getting sunlight sketch the lines with a small space in between 3 x research source don t draw any lines for shaded areas of the map record observations of the sun at 1 00 pm in blue colored pencil repeat your observations four hours later with a blue colored pencil if the sun is still shining in the areas marked yellow from the morning observation add blue to that area make blue lines in the areas where the sun has shifted to as well 4 x research source again if there is shaded area leave that blank record observations of the sun at 5 00 pm in red colored pencil the 5 00 pm recording will be your last observation using the red colored pencil make lines that represent the sun for that time of day if the sun is still in the areas already colored yellow and blue simply add the red on top 5 x research source the areas that have all three colors will get the most sun during the day and be best for planting seeds that require at least 6 hours of sunlight a day the areas with just two colors are best for plants that need partial shade and partial sunlight areas with one or no color are best for plants that need mostly shade 6 x research source if you want a more specific sun chart you can take recordings every two hours instead of every four hours and use more colors to fill it in gather the necessary materials to make this type of a sun chart you will need a piece of paper a pen pencil and a free day to spend observing the sun in your proposed garden space you ll get the most accurate representation of the sun if you take hourly observations but if you re not able to do that make as many observations throughout the day as your schedule allows 7 x research source choose a sunny day for observation to make the most accurate sun chart you ll need a nice sunny day remember there are varying amounts of sun depending on the time of year summer has the most sun while winter has the least try to make your sun chart on a sunny summer day so you can get a good idea of the maximum amount of sun your garden will get you can make multiple sun charts for each season to know which plants to grow divide your yard into regions for this type of sun chart you ll want to divide your garden into separate regions and observe the sunlight in each one you can split it up however you want you don t want the regions to be too large as half of one may be in sunlight and half in shade give your regions distinct names so you remember each one when taking sun observations back left corner front right corner middle left etc ask a landscape architect or garden store associate what size regions might make the most sense given the size of your yard make a chart with the yard regions in rows and time in columns label each column with one hour of the day starting with sun up and ending with sun down during the height of summer this will likely be from 6 00 am to 9 00 pm depending on your location label each row with the regions you divided the garden into 8 x research source observe the sun once an hour from dawn to dusk each hour look at where the sun falls in each region of your garden and record it using sun partial shade and dappled sun is when the region is in full sun partial is some shade some sun shade is no sun and dappled is sunlight through a tree fence or shrub 9 x research source it s okay if you aren t able to make observations every hour but try to take them as close to that as possible for the most accurate sun chart track the sun until it sets use this chart to inform you decisions on the type of seeds to plant and where to plant them plant fruits flowers and vegetables according to their sun shade needs once you ve constructed your sun chart you will have a good idea of what areas of your yard get exposed to light and for how long this information is crucial in growing a vibrant healthy garden plants are categorized by their need for sunlight and usually sorted into three broad categories full sunlight partial sun partial shade full shade full sunlight means at least six hours of sun per day and full shade means less than three hours of sun 10 x research source plant according to the amount of sunlight an area gets from the observations made in your sun chart move planters around to maximize sun exposure maybe there isn t one location in your yard that gets enough sun to plant what you were hoping to plant this can be remedied by planting in a small pot or planter and altering the location of the plant to get the sun it needs this can be a tedious process but will allow you to grow plants that need more or less sunlight than your yard can provide note as the plants grow the planters will get heavier and be more difficult to move keep the sun chart to inform future plantings hang on to your sun chart and use it as a reference the next time you want to do a round of plantings you might also want to make separate sun charts for the different seasons and refer to those as well keep the sun chart with your gardening tools or in the gardening shed if you have one laminating your chart can help protect it to guide future plantings,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to draw the solar system,the solar system is made up of the sun and the 8 planets that orbit it including mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune drawing the solar system is easy once you know the size and order of the planets and it s a great way to learn about the different properties of the celestial bodies that earth shares space with you can even draw the solar system to scale by scaling down the distances between the planets and the sun,draw the sun near the left side of the page the sun is the largest body in the solar system so draw a large circle to represent it then color it in with orange yellow and red to represent the hot gases that it s made up of remember to leave enough space on the page to draw all of the planets 1 x research source the sun is made up of mostly helium and hydrogen gas and it s constantly converting hydrogen into helium through a process called nuclear fusion you can draw the sun freehand or you can trace a round object or use a compass draw mercury to the right of the sun mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and it s the closest planet to the sun to draw mercury draw a small circle remember it needs to be smaller than the rest of the planets you ll be drawing and color it in dark gray like earth mercury has a liquid core and a solid outer crust 2 x research source sketch a larger circle to the right of mercury for venus venus is the second closest planet to the sun and it s bigger than mercury color in venus with different shades of yellow and brown venus gets its yellowish brown color from the clouds of sulfur dioxide that cover its surface however if you were able to travel through the clouds and look at the actual surface of the planet it would look brownish red 3 x research source draw earth to the right of venus earth and venus are very similar in size venus is only 5 smaller in diameter so make the circle you draw for earth just slightly bigger than the one you drew for venus 4 x research source then color in earth using green for the continents and blue for the oceans leave some white space in there to represent the clouds in earth s atmosphere one reason why there s life on earth but not on the other planets in the solar system that scientists know of is because of earth s distance from the sun it s not so close to the sun that temperatures are extremely hot but it s not so far away that everything freezes over either 5 x research source add a smaller circle to the right of earth for mars mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system so draw it slightly bigger than mercury but smaller than venus and earth then color it in with red and brown to give it a rusty color 6 x research source mars gets its iconic rusty red coloring from the iron oxide that covers its surface iron oxide also gives blood and rust their color 7 x research source draw a large circle to the right of mars for jupiter jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system so make it bigger than all of the planets you ve drawn before it just make sure the circle you draw is smaller than the sun you drew since the sun is about 10 times bigger across color in jupiter using red orange yellow and brown to represent the different chemicals in the planet s atmosphere 8 x research source draw a smaller circle with rings to the right of jupiter for saturn saturn is smaller than jupiter but it s bigger than the rest of the planets in the solar system so make it bigger than the first 4 planets you drew color in saturn and its rings using yellow gray brown and orange unlike the other planets saturn has distinct rings circling around it which formed when objects broke up in the planet s orbit and got stuck in its gravitational pull 9 x research source sketch uranus to the right of saturn uranus is the third largest planet in the solar system so draw a circle that s smaller than jupiter and saturn but bigger than all of the other planets you ve drawn so far uranus is mostly made up of ice so color it light blue 10 x research source unlike most of the planets in the solar system uranus doesn t have a rocky molten core instead it s core is made up of mostly ice water and methane draw neptune to the right of uranus neptune is the eighth and final planet in the solar system pluto used to be considered the ninth planet but it s been reclassified as a dwarf planet it s the fourth largest planet so make it smaller than jupiter saturn and uranus but bigger than the rest of the planets then color it in dark blue 11 x research source neptune s atmosphere contains methane which absorbs red light from the sun and reflects blue light that s why the planet appears blue sketch the orbital path of each planet to finish your drawing every planet in the solar system orbits around the sun to show this in your drawing draw a curved path coming off of the top and bottom of each planet extend the paths toward the sun and off the edge of the page to show that each planet travels around the sun 12 x research source make sure none of the orbital paths you draw intersect with each other convert the distance between each planet and the sun to astronomical units in order to accurately represent the distances between the planets and the sun in your drawing first you ll need to convert each distance to astronomical units au the distance from the sun for each planet in au is 13 x research source mercury 0 39 au venus 0 72 au earth 1 au mars 1 53 au jupiter 5 2 au saturn 9 5 au uranus 19 2 au neptune 30 1 au choose a scale to use for your drawing you can make 1 centimeter 1 au 1 inch 1 au or use a different unit or number for your scale however keep in mind that the bigger the unit and number you use the bigger the paper you ll need for your drawing 14 x research source convert all of the distances using your scale to convert the distances multiply each distance in au by the number before the new unit then write down the distance with the new unit 15 x research source for example if your scale is 1 centimeter 1 au you would multiply each distance by 1 to convert them therefore since neptune is 30 1 au away from the sun it would be 30 1 centimeters away in your drawing use the scaled down distances to draw the solar system to scale start by drawing the sun on a piece of paper then measure and mark the scaled down distances from the sun for each planet using a ruler when you re finished draw the planets over the marks you made 16 x research source write down the scale you used somewhere on your drawing so it s clear how far apart the planets are,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a solar system mobile,making a solar system mobile is a great activity for when you re learning about the solar system all you need to build your mobile are some simple supplies and an assortment of craft paints,collect the materials needed to construct the planets it is best to have everything laid out in front of you as you are doing this project you will need styrofoam balls in the following sizes 5 4 3 2 5 2 1 5 and 1 25 inches you will need two each of the 1 5 and 1 25 inch balls you will also need a styrofoam sheet that is 5 inches and 5 x 5 inches this is what you will use to make saturn s rings get acrylic craft paints in the following colors red orange yellow green blue green dark blue cobalt blue light blue white and black you will paint your planets with these colors stick a skewer into each one of the styrofoam balls this will help you paint them don t stick the skewer all the way through the ball instead just put it through about halfway 1 x research source set them aside in the following order 5 inch 1 25 inch 1 5 inch 1 5 inch 1 25 inch 4 inch 3 inch 2 5 inch and 2 inch cut out saturn s rings you will need to trace circles on the styrofoam sheet to do this smooth out the edges of the rings using the rounded side of the teaspoon 2 x research source trace the diameter of the 4 inch jar onto the center of the styrofoam sheet with a pencil or pen center the 3 inch jar in the 4 inch ring you just traced trace around the edge of the 3 inch jar with a pencil or pen cut the styrofoam ring out using an x acto knife by following along your traced lines never let a child use the x acto or serrated knife an adult should always do this step add detail to your sun and first few planets you can do this by painting the styrofoam balls with the craft paint hold each planet by the skewer handle as you do this for a less messy craft put out your paints in plastic cups and fill a cup halfway with water to rinse your paintbrush paint the 5 inch ball bright yellow this will be the sun pick up your next ball it should be 1 25 inches and will represent mercury paint this one orange paint the next ball 1 5 inches blue green this will represent venus paint the next ball 1 5 inches dark blue and add green continents this will be earth mars should be painted red this will be the next 1 25 inch ball paint the gas giants and dowel rod these planets are jupiter saturn uranus and neptune 3 x research source paint the 4 inch ball with orange with red and white stripes this will be jupiter add the great red spot on jupiter in the correct area with red paint paint the 3 inch ball yellow and the styrofoam ring orange this will be saturn get the 2 inch ball and paint it cobalt blue to represent uranus get the 2 5 inch ball and paint it light blue this will represent neptune paint the dowel rod black let the planets and dowel dry they will need to be 100 dry before you hang them on the mobile stick the pointed end of the skewer handles from the planets in a large jar and let the planets dry without touching clean up your area a little bit while they dry you can clean your paintbrush get rid of your paint cups and water and scraps from cutting the rings from saturn put saturn together saturn is more complicated than the other planets due to its rings 4 x research source line the inner rim of the orange painted ring with craft glue push the yellow painted 3 inch styrofoam ball into the ring taking care not to split the styrofoam ring set it aside to dry while you construct the rest of the mobile cut the string that the planets will hang from you will need to cut these at different lengths so the planets hang at different levels 5 x research source cut the string for the sun the shortest make it about 4 inches cut the next string two inches longer so the planet will hang a little bit lower if you cut the string for the sun at 4 inches you would cut the string for mercury at 6 inches as you go along cut each string 2 inches longer neptune should thus hang the lowest of all the planets on the mobile attach the string to each planet you will need to do this to hang the planets from the dowel rod remove the skewer from each planet tie a knot at the end of each string glue the knotted end of each string into the skewer hole on the planet remember to glue the smallest string into the sun and the next longest into mercury and so on the longest string goes with neptune let the glue dry tie the other end of each string for each planet to the dowel rod in planetary order the sun should be first on the left end of the dowel 6 x research source keep the planets a good distance apart you don t want them to touch as they hang secure the string or yarn on the dowel with a dot of glue let this dry suspend the mobile you will hang it using more of the black yarn or string tie a long piece of string to each end of the dowel rod and secure with glue suspend the dowel from the strings playing with the lengths on either end make sure the dowel is suspended horizontally then tie the two strings attached to the ends of the dowel together tightly use the remaining ends of the strings to tie the mobile to a hook in the ceiling find objects to use to suspend the planets you can find these items at the craft store along with your other materials you will need a wooden dowel that is 1 4 inch in diameter and 30 inches long you will suspend your planets from this using string obtain a skein of black yarn or string this is what you will use to hang your planets from the dowel get some thick white craft glue to help secure the planets onto the strings if you don t have a hook to screw into the ceiling to suspend your mobile you will need to get one as well gather the tools you will need to put the materials together you will also want to have these readily available during construction get a pair of scissors and a serrated or x acto knife you will need the scissors to cut string and the x acto knife to cut out the rings for saturn warning never let a child use the x acto knife an adult should help with this get a jar or cup with a 3 inch diameter and another with a 4 inch diameter you will need to use these to trace onto the styrofoam sheet to make saturn s rings you will need a teaspoon to help smooth out the styrofoam gather other supplies these will help you in painting the planets get at least 8 wood skewers these can be the kind you use for kebabs you will stick these into the styrofoam balls to act as a handle for less messy painting of your planets find a couple of plastic cups for water and paint obtain a stiff paintbrush for painting the planets research the planets if you want to use this for a school project you cannot just turn in a mobile and barely know the names of the planets learn the planet s names and order mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune 7 x research source some models may include pluto as a planet but scientists have recently classified this celestial body as a dwarf planet 8 x research source make sure you have some information on the sun which is the center of our solar system,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a solar system model,there are eight known planets orbiting our sun including earth making a model is a fun introduction to this solar system and a good art project for primary school science classes this detailed example can take a few hours to make but most of that involves waiting for paint or clay to dry,find a cardboard box the planets in your solar system model will hang down inside this box you ll need to fit nine planets plus the sun into this so make sure you have enough room this should be at least as large as a men s shoebox which is roughly 15 x 10 x 5½ 36 x 25 x 13 cm 1 x research source paint the box black cover the inside of the box with black acrylic paint along with the short outer sides set the box aside on newspaper to dry for a more even background trace the box onto black paper cut out the paper rectangle and tape it to the base of the box gather five polystyrene balls if possible find these in three different sizes they should all fit in the box with a little room left over although they don t have to squeeze in all in a row you ll need one large ball to make the sun maximum 4 10 cm across two medium balls to make jupiter and saturn maximum 3 7 5 cm two small balls to make uranus and neptune maximum 2 5 cm choose your paints acrylic paint is your best option since some other paints can dissolve polystyrene choose a variety of colors to paint your planets including orange or gold yellow red white and dark blue if you re not sure whether a paint works on polystyrene check the label for brush cleaning instructions if you can wash off the paint with water the paint is water based and safe to use if you need to use a solvent like white spirit or turpentine the paint is solvent based and may dissolve polystyrene 2 x research source paint the sun stick a long skewer into your largest polystyrene ball to hold it in place paint the entire surface with gold yellow or orange paint to make the sun place the skewer in a tall jug or stick the end in a polystyrene block and leave the ball to dry a stenciling brush or other short bristled brush will help you get the paint to stick into the nooks and crannies on your polystyrene ball you might need to let the first coat dry and use a larger brush to paint over it for an even color 3 x research source if the paint doesn t stick at all cover the ball with a thin layer of spackle let it dry and paint over that 4 x research source paint the large planets the same way the two medium balls are the two largest planets jupiter and saturn these are called gas giants they each have a diameter about ten times larger than earth s and are made mostly of a heavy layer of gas surrounding a rocky core 5 x research source skewer these and place them in a polystyrene block or separate jugs so the wet painted surfaces don t touch jupiter s clouds form bands and spiral storms paint this planet with red orange and white paint swirled into patterns saturn is pale yellow a mix of yellow and white paint paint the ice giants your last two balls will represent neptune and uranus the smaller gas giants or ice giants about four times the size of earth in diameter these planets formed from balls of ice and heavy elements since then these materials have turned into a fluid core surrounded by a layer of swirling gas 6 x research source paint uranus a pale blue made by mixing blue and white paint together white clouds sometimes form over the solid blue atmosphere 7 x research source neptune is almost the same color as uranus but looks darker because it s farther away and receives less light 8 x research source paint it blue add saturn s rings find a drinking glass with an opening the same size as the ball you used to make saturn put the glass down on gold or yellow construction paper and trace around it with a pencil to make a ring shape put down a larger glass over your pencil circle and trace around that as well cut out this ring then glue it around saturn and let dry to cut out the ring start by cutting out the larger circle fold the circle gently in half without creasing it then cut around the smaller circle shape five rocky planets out of clay you can use polymer clay air dry clay or homemade polymer clay substitute roll five small balls maximum 1 2 5 cm across using several colors of clay mercury is a brownish gray rock with no cloud cover 9 x research source you can make it out of red or gold clay instead for a prettier model make earth out of blue clay for now make venus out of pale yellow clay pluto is technically not a planet it s too small but it can sneak in anyway make it out of light brown clay maybe with some charcoal mixed in to imitate its blotchy surface poke a hole through each ball of clay use a large needle to pierce each rocky planet through the center you ll run thread through this hole later to hang the planets inside your box poke the hole through saturn at an angle so the rings will be tilted when the planet is hanging down this will look better and give you a little extra room to arrange the planets let the clay dry follow the dry instructions on the clay packaging air dry clay dries on its own while other types of polymer clay needs a low temperature oven to harden for light colored clay it s a good idea to set your oven about 10ºf 5ºc lower than the instructions recommend this can take twice as long to bake but the chance of breaking is lower 10 x research source paint the land onto earth once the earth clay is hard paint on the continents with green acrylic paint 11 x research source paint on stars once the black paint on the box has dried use a white paint pen or small brush to paint white dots onto the inside of the box thread the polystyrene balls once the sun is dry stick a skewer all the way through the ball then remove it tape a piece of clear beading thread to the end of the skewer and push it through the same hole repeat for each polystyrene ball each length of beading thread should be long enough to hang a planet from the ceiling of the box when the box is on its side five or six inches 13 15 cm should be enough glue on the thread hold the end of the thread and withdraw the skewer knot the beading thread two or three times then attach the knot to the polystyrene ball using a drop of glue from a hot glue gun thread the clay planets once the clay planets are dry drop the clear thread through the holes you made earlier attach the thread with a hot glue gun as you did with the larger planets arrange the planets in the model put the box on its side and hold up the threads on the ceiling stagger the position of the planets at different heights top bottom and depths front back so you can fit them all in the box the balls should go in this order sun mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune pluto hang the planets in the box once you find an arrangement that looks good and fits in the box mark the box at the ten points where you ll hang the sun and planets cut through the box at these points with a sharp knife and feed the thread the planets are hanging from through each hole tape down the thread with strong tape and cut off the extra

how to make a planet model,few science fair projects are as timeless as a planet model and for good reason planet models showcase knowledge about the planet as well as skill at portraying its physical characteristics and scale whether you re creating a planet model for school or for fun start by depicting your planet with papier mache or styrofoam from there you can simply paint your planet or connect it to a solar system of your own making,decide which planet to make this will help you determine how large to make your planet while this isn t too important if you re only making one if you decide to make a whole solar system of planets you may want to make them somewhat to scale for example you d want to make mars or mercury much smaller than saturn or jupiter blow up a balloon don t blow the balloon up too much or it will become oval in shape try to add just enough air to make it circular while making it as large or small as you d like place the balloon tied end down in a bowl this will hold it still and make it easier to apply the papier mache 1 x research source make your adhesive you can use either glue and water raw flour and water or flour and water that s been cooked there are different advantages to each the glue and water is easy to mix up the raw flour and water paste is stronger and the boiled flour and water paste dries clear for glue and water paste use about 1 4 cup of white school glue and add water just till it becomes slightly runny 2 x research source for raw flour and water mix enough water into flour until you get the consistency you d like remember that thicker paste will take longer to dry and that you ll need to let your paper mache balloon dry overnight for boiled flour and water whisk together 1 2 cup flour of flour and 2 1 2 cups of water over medium heat until the mixture boils it will thicken into a gel as it cools 3 x research source 4 x research source shred your papers you can use newspapers brown craft paper or construction paper use whatever you have easy access to and be sure to rip your paper into pieces or strips avoid cutting the papers the straight lines will be visible once the paper mache dries the torn edges of your ripped papers will blend in better apply your paper to the balloon dip the strips or pieces of paper into your paste be sure to completely coat the paper with the glue but slide your fingers over the paper to remove excess paste lay the strips or pieces over your entire balloon add another layer of strips over your entire balloon use your hands to smooth out any bubbles or bumps on the surface of your balloon unless you want to give your planet a bumpy texture let your papier mache balloon dry leave it in a warm place to dry overnight the paper and paste must be completely dry before you begin painting or decorating your model if you don t let it dry it may mold in some cases it may take longer to dry if your balloon has a lot of paste or layers it may take more time try letting it dry a few days pop the balloon once your paper mache is dry pop the balloon using a pin or a thumbtack 5 x research source remove the deflated balloon and any bits of balloon that may be inside your hollow planet paint your planet for a simple model use acrylic to paint your planet with its predominant color for the sun use yellow for mercury use grey for venus use yellowish white for earth use blue green for mars use red for jupiter use orange with white striations for saturn use pale yellow for uranus use light blue for neptune use blue for pluto use light brown decide which planet to make this will help you determine how large to make your planet while this isn t too important if you re only making one if you decide to make a whole solar system of planets you may want to make them somewhat to scale for example you d want to make mars or mercury much smaller than saturn or jupiter select styrofoam thermocol balls if you re only doing one planet make it whatever size you d like but if you decide to make an entire solar system choose different sizes this will allow you to accurately depict the scale of the planets for the sun use a 5 or 6 inch ball for mercury use a 1 inch ball for venus use a 1 5 inch ball for earth use a 1 5 inch ball for mars use a 1 25 inch ball for jupiter use a 4 inch ball for saturn use a 3 inch ball for uranus use a 2 5 inch ball for neptune use a 2 inch ball for pluto use a 1 25 inch ball paint your planet for a simple model use acrylic to paint your planet with its predominant color for the sun use yellow for mercury use grey for venus use yellowish white for earth use blue green for mars use red for jupiter use orange with white striations for saturn use pale yellow for uranus use light blue for neptune use blue for pluto use light brown add texture or defining characteristics to your model if your planet has several colors go back and dab the other color over the surface if your planet has rings attach wire or a styrofoam ring around the planet for rings you can also cut the styrofoam planet model in half horizontally and glue an old cd through the center reattach the styrofoam halves with glue the cd should appear as rings around the planet 6 x research source for craters you can chip out bits of styrofoam to make a craggy surface you ll want to dab fresh paint over these areas prepare dowel rods if you want to make a solar system if you ve made all the planets to scale take dowel rods and cut them to size this will ensure that the planets are the appropriate distance apart you won t need any dowel rods for the sun since it will be the center of the system model for mercury use a 2 25 inch rod for venus use a 4 inch rod for earth use 5 inch rod for mars use 6 inch rod for jupiter a 7 inch rod for saturn use an 8 inch rod for uranus use a 10 inch rod for neptune use an 11 5 inch rod for pluto use a 14 inch rod attach planets to the sun using the trimmed dowel rods stick the rod into the corresponding planet then stick the opposite end of the dowel rod into the sun be sure to stick rods around the entire circumference of the sun start with mercury closest to the sun

poster about each planet that will make it even more interesting to look at,gather the necessary materials to make your poster three dimensional you will need to use styrofoam balls to give it depth other materials you will need are a 5 x5 x1 2 foam sheet glue string markers tape craft paint a serrated knife a silver marker sharpie brown construction paper nine wooden skewers a ruler and a black 20 x 30 poster board use the following styrofoam balls for the planets 1 each of 5 4 3 2 5 and 2 balls and 2 1 5 balls adult supervision is recommended when using the knife you ll need the following paint colors yellow orange red green light blue and dark blue these materials can be purchased at any craft store or the craft department of a superstore slice all of the foam balls in half ask an adult for help with this step use the knife to cut all of the balls except one of the 1 5 balls in half it doesn t have to be exactly in half close to half is fine rub the two halves together over a trash can to brush the crumbs away after cutting rubbing the knife with beeswax or candle wax before cutting will make it easier to slice squash the second 1 5 ball on the table to compress it to about 1 25 thick then cut it in half cut a ring for the 3 ball this ring will represent saturn s rings place the 3 ball in the middle of the foam sheet and trace around it with a sharp pencil draw a second circle around the outside of the first circle about 1 away use the tip of the knife to cut out the ring again have an adult help with this step make a uniform second circle by tracing around the exterior of your 4 ball paint the balls according to planet stick a wooden skewer into the flat part of ball this will make it easier to paint and let stand to dry paint each ball the following colors sun 5 ball yellow mercury 1¼ ball orange venus 1 5 ball blue green earth 1 5 ball dark blue mars 1¼ ball red jupiter 4 ball orange saturn 3 ball yellow foam ring orange uranus 2 5 ball light blue neptune 2 ball dark blue use the sun to map planet locations mark the location for the center of the sun by measuring 10 down from the top of the board and 3 in from the right side of the poster make a small x to mark the center of the sun place the end of the ruler at the center of the sun and make a mark along the center of the poster at the distances below for each planet these distances mark the orbits of the planets mercury 3 ½ from the sun venus 4 ¾ from the sun earth 5 ¾ from the sun mars 7 from the sun jupiter 15 ¼ from the sun saturn 18 ½ from the sun uranus 21 from the sun neptune 25 ¾ from the sun create the orbit for each planet use the string as a compass to make a circular orbit with the mark for each planet place one end of the string in the center mark for the sun and tape it down put the pencil down on the mark for mercury and wrap the string around the pencil until it is taut with the string extended draw a circle around the poster board with the pencil to make the orbit repeat this process with each planet s orbit moving the pencil to each mark trace a dashed line on top of the pencil with the silver marker glue each planet somewhere on its orbit stagger the placement of each planet so they don t overlap add an asteroid belt between mars and jupiter cut out asteroid shapes from the brown construction paper space out the asteroids to make a belt all along the gap between mars and jupiter glue them down and label the area asteroid belt asteroids are giant rocks floating through space and can easily be drawn freehand any rock shape you draw can be used as an asteroid gather the necessary materials to make a flat poster you can either draw the planets or cut them out of construction paper and glue them down on the poster board you will need a large poster board white or black colored construction paper optional scissors markers and white craft glue or a glue stick metallic markers will show up really well on a black poster board use these for labels know the order of the planets the first step in making a solar system poster is to know how the solar system looks start with the sun and then add the planets in the correct order mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune you can also include dwarf planets like pluto haumea makemake and eris outside of neptune cut the construction paper into planet shapes make one for every planet in the solar system mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune try to cut your planets to scale mercury and mars will be the smallest venus and earth are slightly larger uranus and neptune are about 5 times larger than venus earth saturn is about 12 times larger and jupiter is the largest about 14 times larger alternatively you can print pictures of each planet and cut those out glue the planets onto the poster in their proper order draw planets on the poster instead of making cutouts of the planets you can draw them directly onto the poster board in order to draw the planets it would be better to use a white poster board instead of a black poster board use markers of different colors to draw each planet use a geometry compass or trace circular objects of different sizes to make perfectly sized planets add the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter either draw asteroids with a brown marker or cut them out of construction paper and glue them down the asteroid belt separates the inner and outer planets add other embellishments like comets shooting stars or rockets research and add facts about the planets find out specific information about the planets like their size distance from the sun number of moons origin of the name and any other interesting facts there may be type up a small blurb about each planet and paste it next to the planet 1 x research source make your poster really interesting by having flaps for people to lift up or different textures tin foil is good for a space theme facts about the planets and

how to create an earth and moon model,you don t need the power of a telescope to study and understand the relationship of the moon and the earth by creating an earth and moon model you can replicate some aspects of this relationship things like solar and lunar eclipses can be modeled by making such a model,round up your materials for this project you ll need 2 spheres of different sizes 2 sticks paint or markers a piece of wood or other surface to anchor the sticks to and nails screws or glue to anchor the sticks for the spheres styrofoam balls will work nicely but you could also use rubber or plastic balls the smaller ball should have approximately ¼ the diameter of the larger ball for example if the larger ball is has a diameter of 4 inches 10 cm the smaller ball should have a diameter of 1 inch 2 5 cm 1 x research source decorate the larger ball like the earth the earth is larger than the moon this fact should be reflected in your model color the large ball with blue marker or paint to represent the oceans and green or brown paint to represent the continents this will give your model character and make it more realistic it will also help others to understand what they are looking at when they see your model 2 x research source make the smaller ball look like the moon the smaller ball can be colored grey you can add black dots and circles to denote the craters that are scattered across the moon s surface some people also choose to color the moon yellow just make it clear that it is not the sun the relative size of the objects should be a reasonable indication that your model contains the moon and not the sun the sun is much larger than the earth or moon place each ball on a stick in order to fix your model so that the earth and moon are always in the place you want them to be you will need to put each ball on a stick if you ve used the styrofoam balls this will be rather easy just slide the a metal plastic or wooden stick through the center of the ball so that it stands on the stick there is no need to push the stick all the way through measure the distance you want between the balls you can place the balls any distance apart however if you want to make the model to scale you will need to measure the distance more precisely the objects should be separated by a distance of 9 5 times the earth s circumference measure this distance with a ruler or tape measurer 3 x research source for example if your earth is 4 inches 10 cm in diameter the moon should rest 38 inches 97 cm from the earth anchor the sticks to a piece of wood once you have measured the appropriate distance for your objects it is time to mount them use nails screws or glue to set the sticks on a board this will allow you to move the model without it coming apart ask an adult to help you with this step particularly if you re nailing or screwing the sticks to the board demonstrate a solar eclipse to do this you will need a flashlight or a lamp cast a solar eclipse by shining the light onto the moon ball this will create a shadow on the earth ball 4 x research source make sure that the lights in the room are turned off so that you can see the shadow demonstrate a lunar eclipse to do this you will do the opposite of what you did to cast a solar eclipse use the flashlight or lamp to cast a lunar eclipse by shining the light onto the earth ball this will create a shadow on the moon ball 5 x research source understand the relationship between the earth and moon the moon orbits the earth on a cycle of approximately 28 days this generates the tides in the ocean and allows us to see different stages of the moon half moon full moon etc the earth holds the moon in its gravitational orbit and prevents it from drifting off into space hang your model when your model is not in use you can hang it from your ceiling this makes a good decoration and displays your model to do this you can tie a string around the middle of your model and hang it or you can screw or glue a hook to the center of the model for hanging,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to calculate center of gravity,the center of gravity cg is the center to an object s weight distribution where the force of gravity can be considered to act this is the point where the object is in perfect balance no matter how turned or rotated around that point 1 x research source if you want to know how to calculate the center of gravity of an object then you have to find the weight of the object and any objects on it locate the datum and plug the known quantities into the equation for calculating the center of gravity if you want to know how to calculate the center of gravity just follow these steps,calculate the weight of the object when you re calculating the center of gravity the first thing you should do is to find the weight of the object let s say that you re calculating the weight of a see saw that has a weight of 30 lbs since it s a symmetrical object its center of gravity will be exactly in its center if it s empty but if the see saw has people of different weights sitting on it then the problem is a bit more complicated 2 x research source calculate the additional weights to find the center of gravity of the see saw with two children on it you ll need to individually find the weight of the children on it the first child has a weight of 40 lbs and the second child s is 60 lbs choose a datum the datum is an arbitrary starting point placed on one end of the see saw 3 x research source you can place the datum on one end of the see saw or the other let s say the see saw is 16 feet long let s place the datum on the left side of the see saw close to the first child measure the datum s distance from the center of the main object as well as from the two additional weights let s say the children are each sitting 1 foot away from each end of the see saw the center of the see saw is the midpoint of the see saw or at 8 feet since 16 feet divided by 2 is 8 here are the distances from the center of the main object and the two additional weights form the datum center of see saw 8 feet away from datum child 1 1 foot away from datum child 2 15 feet away from datum multiply each object s distance from the datum by its weight to find its moment this gives you the moment for each object here s how to multiply each object s distance from the datum by its weight the see saw 30 lb x 8 ft 240 ft x lb child 1 40 lb x 1 ft 40 ft x lb child 2 60 lb x 15 ft 900 ft x lb add up the three moments simply do the math 240 ft x lb 40 ft x lb 900 ft x lb 1180 ft x lb the total moment is 1180 ft x lb add the weights of all the objects find the sum of the weights of the seesaw the first child and the second child to do this add up the weights 30 lbs 40 lbs 60 lbs 130 lbs divide the total moment by the total weight this will give you the distance from the datum to the center of gravity of the object to do this simply divide 1180 ft x lb by 130 lbs 1180 ft x lb 130 lbs 9 08 ft the center of gravity is 9 08 feet from the datum or measured 9 08 feet from the end of the left side of the see saw which is where the datum was placed find the center of gravity in the diagram if the center of gravity you found is outside of the system of objects you have the wrong answer 4 x research source you may have measured the distances from more than one point try again with just one datum for example for people sitting on a seesaw the center of gravity has to be somewhere on the seesaw not to the left or right of the seesaw it does not have to be directly on a person this is still true with problems in two dimensions draw a square just large enough to fit all of the objects in your problem the center of gravity must be inside this square check your math if you get a tiny answer if you picked one end of the system as your datum a tiny answer puts the center of gravity right next to one end this can be the right answer but it s often the sign of a mistake when you calculated the moment did you multiply the weight and distance together that s the correct way to find the moment if you accidentally added them together instead you ll usually get a much smaller answer troubleshoot if you have more than one center of gravity every system only has a single center of gravity if you find more than one you might have skipped the step where you add all the moments together the center of gravity is the total moment divided by total weight you do not need to divide each moment by each weight which only tells you the position of each object check your datum if your answer is off by a whole number the answer to our example is 9 08 ft let s say you try it and get the answer 1 08 ft 7 08 ft or another number ending in 08 this most likely happened because we chose the left end of the seesaw as the datum while you chose the right end or some other point an integer distance from our datum your answer is actually correct no matter which datum you choose you just need to remember that the datum is always at x 0 here s an example the way we solved it the datum is at the left end of the seesaw our answer was 9 08 ft so our center of mass is 9 08 ft from the datum at the left end if you pick a new datum 1 ft from the left end you get the answer 8 08 ft for the center of mass the center of mass is 8 08 ft from the new datum which is 1 ft from the left end the center of mass is 8 08 1 9 08 ft from the left end the same answer we got before note when measuring distance remember that distances to the left of the datum are negative while distances to the right are positive make sure all your measurements are in straight lines let s say you see another kids on the seesaw example but one kid is much taller than the other or one kid is hanging underneath the seesaw instead of sitting on top ignore the difference and take all your measurements along the straight line of the seesaw measuring distances at angles will lead to answers that are close but slightly off for seesaw problems all you care about is where the center of gravity is along the left right line of the seesaw later you might learn more advanced ways to calculate the center of gravity in two dimensions,Hobbies-and-Crafts

research source m1 is the mass of the first object m2 is the mass of the second object d is the distance between the centers of two objects sometimes you will see the letter r instead of the letter d both symbols represent the distance between the two objects use the proper metric units for this particular equation you must use metric units the masses of objects need to be in kilograms kg and the distance needs to be in meters m you must convert to these units before continuing with the calculation determine the mass of the object in question for smaller objects you can weigh them on a scale or balance to determine their weight in grams for larger objects you will have to look up the approximate mass in a table or online in physics problems the mass of the object will generally be

n understand newton s second law of motion f ma newton s second law of motion states that any object will accelerate when acted upon by a net or unbalanced force 9 x research source in other words if a force is acting upon an object that is greater than the forces acting in the opposite direction the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force this law can be summed up with the equation f ma where f is the force m is the mass of the object and a is acceleration using this law we can calculate the force of gravity of any object on the surface of the earth using the known acceleration due to gravity know the acceleration due to gravity on earth on earth the force of gravity causes objects to accelerate at a rate of 9 8 m s2 on the earth s surface we can use the simplified equation fgrav mg to calculate the force of gravity if you want a more exact approximation of force you can still use the above equation fgrav gmearthm d2 to determine force of gravity use the proper metric units for this particular equation you must use metric units the mass of the object needs to be in kilograms kg and the acceleration needs to be in meters per second squared m s2 you must convert to these units before continuing with the calculation determine the mass of the object in question for smaller objects you can weigh them on a scale or balance to determine its weight in

how to calculate the center of gravity of a triangle,the center of gravity or centroid is the point at which a triangle s mass will balance to help visualize this imagine you have a triangular tile suspended over the tip of a pencil the tile will balance if the pencil tip is placed at its center of gravity finding the centroid might be necessary in various design and engineering applications and can be found by using simple geometry,find the midpoint of one side of the triangle to find the midpoint measure the side and divide the length in half label the midpoint a for example if one side of the triangle is 10 cm long the midpoint will be at 5 cm since 10 2 5 displaystyle 10 2 5 find the midpoint of a second side of the triangle measure the length of the side and divide the length in half label the midpoint b for example if the side of the triangle is 12 cm long the midpoint will be at 6 cm since 12 2 6 displaystyle 12 2 6 draw a line from the midpoint of each side to its opposite vertex these two lines are the median of each side 1 x research source a vertex is the point at which two sides of a triangle meet draw a point where the two medians intersect this point is the triangle s center of gravity also called the centroid or center of mass 2 x research source 3 x research source the center of gravity is where the three medians intersect but since the medians only intersect in one point you can use a shortcut and find the center of gravity by only finding the intersection of two medians draw a median of your triangle remember the median is a line drawn from the midpoint of a side to the opposite vertex you can use any median in the triangle measure the length of the median make sure the measurement is exact for example you might have a median that is 3 6 cm long divide the length of the median into thirds to do this divide the length by three again make an exact calculation if you round you will not find the center of gravity for example if your median is 3 6 cm long you would divide 3 6 by 3 3 6cm 3 1 2cm displaystyle 3 6cm 3 1 2cm so ⅓ of the median is 1 2 cm mark a point on the median ⅓ from the midpoint this point is the triangle s centroid which will always divide a median into a 2 1 ratio that is the centroid is ⅓ the median s distance from the midpoint and ⅔ the median s distance from the vertex 4 x research source for example on a median that is 3 6 cm long the centroid will be 1 2 cm up from the midpoint determine the coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle this method only works if you are working with a coordinate plane the coordinates may already be given or you may have a triangle drawn on a graph without the coordinates labeled remember that coordinates should be listed x y displaystyle x y for example you might be given triangle pqr and you need to find and label point p 3 5 point q 4 1 and r 1 0 add the value of the x coordinates remember to add all three coordinates you will not calculate the correct center of gravity if you only use two coordinates for example if your three x coordinates are 3 4 and 1 add these three values together 3 4 1 8 displaystyle 3 4 1 8 add the value of the y coordinates remember to add all three coordinates for example if your three y coordinates are 5 1 and 0 add these three values together 5 1 0 6 displaystyle 5 1 0 6 find the average of the x and y coordinates these coordinates will correspond to the triangle s center of gravity also known as the centroid or center of mass 5 x research source to find the average divide the sum of the coordinates by 3 for example if the sum of your x coordinates is 8 the average x coordinate is 8 3 displaystyle 8 3 if the sum of your y coordinates is 6 the average y coordinate is 6 3 displaystyle 6 3 or 2 displaystyle 2 plot the center of gravity on the triangle the center of gravity or centroid is the average of the x and y coordinates in the example problem the center of gravity is the point 8 3 2 displaystyle 8 3 2,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to test the specific gravity of liquids,specific gravity also referred to as relative density is used to relate the weight or density of liquids to that of water specific gravity is a unitless measurement that is derived as a ratio of either the weight of another liquid or the density of another liquid divided by the weight or density of water temperature must also be taken into account when determining specific gravity since density changes in relation to temperature,pour a sample of your liquid into a container make sure that the liquid in the container is deep enough to allow the hydrometer to float if the hydrometer rests on the bottom of the container you will not get an accurate reading leave room in the container for the hydrometer to displace some of the liquid otherwise you ll end up with a spill the shape and material of the container is irrelevant as long as there is enough liquid present for the hydrometer to float properly check that your liquid is the correct temperature your hydrometer will be calibrated to a specific temperature if your liquid is at a different temperature the density of the liquid will not match the calibration of the hydrometer this will cause your reading to be incorrect a common hydrometer calibration is 60 f 16 c you can use a thermometer to check the temperature of your liquid and then heat or cool as needed place the hydrometer in the liquid the hydrometer is a specialized glass tube that has a weighted end place it in the water with the weighted end down allow the hydrometer to settle and stop bobbing before taking a reading read the specific gravity from the hydrometer the hydrometer is marked with different specific gravity measurements at different intervals once it stops floating the water line will be at one of these marks the number corresponding to this mark is the specific gravity of your liquid the reading on the hydrometer is usually a decimal but it is derived as a ratio of the density of your liquid to the density of water at a given temperature in other words if your hydrometer reads 1 1 that means your liquid was 1 1 times as dense as water at that temperature note that specific gravity is a unitless measurement you can look up the specific gravity of some common liquids examples are listed below acetic acid 1 052 acetone 0 787 beer 1 01 bromine 3 12 milk 1 035 mercury 13 633 obtain a weight for the liquid in question first pre weigh a container next take the weight of the container again but this time with a specified volume of your liquid inside subtract the weight of the liquid filled container from the weight of the empty container the difference is the weight of your liquid 1 x research source for example if your container weighed 1 50 pounds with liquid in it and 1 00 pound empty your equation would look like this 1 50 lb 1 00 lb 0 50 lb your liquid weighs 0 50 pounds make sure the temperature of your liquid is noted when this weight is taken you must compare it to water of the same temperature obtain the weight of an identical volume of water fill the same container to the same volume then weigh the container and find the weight of that volume of water you should not need to pre weigh the container again since you already know the weight of the empty container 2 x research source use the same formula to find the weight of the water if the liquid filled container weighted 1 75 pounds the equation would look like this 1 75 lb 1 00 lb 0 75 lb in this example the water weighs 0 75 pounds make sure that the water is at the exact same temperature as the liquid in question otherwise results may not be accurate calculate the ratio of the liquid s weight to the weight of water since you are dividing one weight by another the units will cancel out this makes specific gravity a unitless measurement use the ratio wl wwater where wl is the weight of your liquid and wwater is the weight of water 3 x research source for example if you weighed 100 ml of acetone at 25 degrees celsius it would weigh 0 17314 pounds weighing the same volume of water at the same temperature would give you 0 22 pounds to find the specific gravity of this acetone you would solve 0 17314lbs 0 22lbs 0 787 displaystyle 0 17314lbs 0 22lbs 0 787 this is the specific gravity of acetone obtain the density for the liquid in question the density of a substance is equal to its mass divided by its volume you can measure the mass on a scale and record the volume of the liquid used use the equation m v d where m is mass in grams or kilograms v is volume in milliliters or liters and d is density 4 x research source for example if you had a sample that was 8 grams and 9 milliliters your equation would be 8 00 g 9 00 ml 0 89 g ml weigh an empty container first and record its weight next fill your container with the desired liquid and weigh it again the mass of your liquid is equal to the second measurement minus the first for instance if the filled container weighed 2 00 lbs and the empty container weighed 0 75 lbs the equation would be 2 00 0 75 1 25 and the liquid would weigh 1 25 lbs obtain the density of an identical volume of water between 10 degrees celsius and 30 degrees celsius the density of water can be rounded to 1 00 assuming 3 significant figures if you are using liquids that do not fall in that temperature range you can measure the mass and the volume of your water and calculate the density alternatively you can often find charts with the density of water at different temperatures 5 x research source it s important to find the density of water that is the same temperature as the liquid in order to get accurate measurements keep your liquids the same temperature substances expand when they are heated and contract when they are cooled since density is a measure of how much mass is in a given volume the measurement is changed by the expansion and contraction due to temperature 6 x research source if you want to get accurate specific gravity calculations it is necessary that the liquid you are measuring and the water that you are using as a comparison are both at the same temperature calculate the ratio of the liquid s density to the density of water the units will cancel out in this equation leaving you with a unitless quantity that number is the specific gravity or relative density of your liquid the ratio used will be dl dwater where dl is the density of your liquid and dwater is the density of your water 7 x research source for example if you were to take the density of acetone 0 787 g ml 25 degrees c and divide it by the density of water 1 00 g ml 25 degrees c you would get 0 787g ml 1 00g ml 0 787 displaystyle 0 787g ml 1 00g ml 0 787,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build and use a pendulum,a pendulum is a device that uses gravity to swing a weight back and forth because of their consistent and measurable swings or oscillations as they re called pendulums have been used for hundreds of years to keep time part of the beauty of a pendulum is its simplicity with a few supplies you can build and use your own pendulum to try out different experiments to see how the physics of a pendulum work,tape a pencil horizontally to the top of a table lay a pencil on its side and use clear tape to firmly fasten it to a tabletop leave about 1 2 inch 1 3 cm of the pencil hanging over the edge the pencil will anchor your pendulum and keep it from falling down so be sure to use enough tape to secure it and keep it from moving around 1 x research source test the pencil by flicking it with your finger it should stay stuck to the tabletop tie a loop about 1 inch 2 5 cm in diameter at one end of a string take a length of string 2 3 feet 0 61 0 91 m long and curl one end to form a loop the loop needs to fit around the pencil but not too tight or it won t swing properly tie a knot with the loop to keep it from coming undone 2 x research source slide the loop onto the pencil and slide it off to make sure it s not too tight make a small 1 2 inch 1 3 cm hook with a metal wire take a 2 in 5 1 cm length of metal wire and curl one end of it into a j shape to form your hook the hook will hold the weight that swings the pendulum so shape your hook so it s easy to attach and remove nuts onto it to alter the weight of the pendulum 3 x research source you can use pliers to curl the metal wire slide a 1 4 inch 0 64 cm nut onto the end of the hook use a standard metallic nut as the weight for your pendulum the hole in the center makes a nut ideal for sliding onto the hook and you can easily add or remove nuts to experiment with different weights slide the nut onto the hook so that it s not able to fall or slide off when the pendulum swings 4 x research source do not close the hook around the nut tape a piece of paper on a wall or table behind the hook you can use the paper to mark where you release the pendulum each time so you can see the way the pendulum behaves and swings based on where you release it tape the paper so that it is a backdrop behind the hook with the nut on it 5 x research source any color paper is fine as long as you can see the pencil markings pull the hook with the nut on it back about 20 inches 51 cm before you release it use your pencil to mark on the paper taped behind the pendulum where you release it from that way you can repeat the experiment by letting the pendulum go from the same place each time 6 x research source you need to have a consistent release point for accurate results in your experiments release the pendulum and start a stopwatch when you release the pendulum count the number of oscillations or the number of times it swings back and forth for 1 minute repeat the process 5 times releasing the pendulum from the same spot on the paper each time 7 x research source let the pendulum fall on its own don t swing or push it write down the number of oscillations so you can calculate an average calculate the average of the oscillations take the number of oscillations from each time you released the pendulum add them all together then divide the number by 5 this is the average number of oscillations the pendulum completes from that distance and at that weight 8 x research source add a nut to the hook to see what difference the mass makes add a second nut to the hook and bring the pendulum back to where you marked on the paper the first time when you release the pendulum start a stopwatch and count the number of oscillations for 1 minute repeat the process 5 times then calculate your average notice the difference in the number of oscillations and the average between 1 nut on the hook and 2 nuts on the hook add another nut and repeat the experiment to see if even more mass will affect the pendulum s oscillations 9 x research source change the distance to see how it affects the oscillations go back to just 1 nut on the hook bring the string back about 10 inches 25 cm and make a mark on the paper taped behind it so you can repeat the experiment from the same distance release the pendulum and count the number of oscillations for 1 minute repeat the process 5 times and calculate an average 10 x research source you may be surprised to learn that the distance also called amplitude does not affect the swing rate or number of oscillations try the experiment again from 5 inches 13 cm and find the average number of oscillations to see how much of a difference the distance makes cut off 10 inches 25 cm of the string to see the effects slide the look off of the pencil and cut off 10 inches 25 cm of string tie another loop and put it back on the pencil then bring the pendulum back about 10 inches 25 cm and mark on the paper where you release it from repeat the experiment 5 times and find the average number of oscillations to see how the length of the string affects the pendulum cut off another 10 inches 25 cm of string to see the difference it makes on the average number of oscillations the length from which a pendulum is suspended helps determine the speed and regularity of the swings which is why pendulums have been used to keep time 11 x

how to measure surface tension,surface tension refers to the ability of a liquid to resist the force of gravity for example water forms droplets on a table because the water molecules at the surface group together against the force of gravity 1 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source surface tension is what allows a denser object such as an insect to be able to float on the water s surface surface tension is measured by the amount of force n exerted on a unit such as length m or the amount of energy of a measured area these are measured as newton per meter or n meter 2 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source the forces that water molecules exert on each other or cohesive forces cause the tension and are responsible for the shape of water or other liquid drops you can measure surface tension with a few household items and a calculator,define the equation to solve for surface tension in this experiment the equation for surface tension will be determined by the equation f 2sd f is the force in newtons n s is the surface tension in n m and d is the length of the needle used in the experiment rearranging the equation to solve for surface tension yields s f 2d the force will be calculated at the end of the experiment measure the length of the needle in meters using a ruler before starting the experiment construct a small balance beam 3 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source in this experiment you will use a balance beam and a small needle floating on the surface of water to measure surface tension the balance beam needs to be well constructed so that you can get an accurate result you can use many different types of materials for this just make sure the center beam is something sturdy like wood plastic or dense cardboard mark the center of the material to be used for your beam straw plastic ruler and drill or poke a hole through it this will be the fulcrum point the point that allows the beam to rotate freely if you are using a plastic straw you can just poke a pin or nail right through it drill or poke a hole at each end of the beam ensuring that they are the same distance from the middle thread a string through each hole to serve as holders for the balance dishes make sure that there is 1 string for each hole at either end rest the nail horizontally between two stacks of books so that the center beam can rotate freely fold a piece of aluminum foil to form a box or dish the dish does not have to be exactly square or round the dish will be filled with water or another weight so make sure it is sturdy enough to support this hang the box or dish from one end of the beam poke small holes in the sides of the dish and thread the string through to hold up the dish hang a needle or paper clip horizontally from the other end of the beam with thread on the opposite side of the beam tie a paper clip or needle to the end of the string so that it lays flat for the experiment to work it is important that the paper clip or needle is horizontal place a piece of material such as clay or play doh on the beam to counterbalance the aluminum container before beginning the experiment you want to make sure that the beam is lying flat the dish will be heavier than the needle causing the beam to lower in the direction of the dish add enough clay to the opposite side of the beam so that the beam is level this is called counterbalancing the clay does not affect the calculations because it is balancing out the beam place the needle or paper clip hanging from the beam into a container of water this step may require some extra effort to ensure the needle is resting just on the top of the water s surface you do not want the needle submerged in the water fill a container with water or other liquid of unknown surface tension and place it underneath the needle at a height that allows the needle to rest directly on top the surface make sure the string holding the needle in place remains taut once the needle is on top of the water weigh a batch of pins or several measured drops of water on a small postal scale you will be adding pins or drops of water one at a time to the aluminum dish you constructed earlier for the calculation it is important to know exactly how much weight is required to lift the needle out of the water count out a number of pins or drops of water and weigh them determine the individual weight of each drop or pin by dividing the total weight by the number of pins or water drops for example let s say 30 pins weigh 15 grams 15 30 0 5 each pin weighs 0 5 grams add the pins or drops of water one at a time to your aluminum foil container until the needle is freed from the water s surface slowly add a pin or a drop of water to the aluminum dish one pin drop at a time watch the needle closely to see if it comes out of the water with each new addition stop adding pins drops once the needle is no longer in contact with the surface of the water count the number of pins or drops of water needed to remove the counterweight from the water s surface record each reading repeat the exercise several times 5 or 6 for more accurate readings calculate an average of the results by adding the total number of pins needed in each trial and dividing that by the total number of trials convert the measurement of pins into force by multiplying the number of grams by 0 00981 n g to calculate the surface tension you need to know the total amount of force required to remove the needle from the surface of the liquid because you weighed the pins in the previous step you can easily do this calculation using the conversion factor 0 00981 n g 4 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source multiply the number of pins added to the dish by the weight of each pin for example 5 pins at 0 5 g pin 5 x 0 5 2 5 g multiply the amount of grams by the conversion factor 0 00981 n g 2 5 x 0 00981 0 025 n plug the variables into the equation and solve using the measurements you gathered throughout the experiment you can now solve for force simply plug the numbers into the correct variable and solve using the proper order of operations continuing our example let s say the needle was 0 025 m long plugging the variables into the equation yields s f 2d 0 025 n 2 x 0 025 0 05 n m the surface tension of the liquid is 0 05 n m understand capillary action in order to understand capillary action you first need to understand adhesion and cohesive forces adhesion is the force that causes a liquid to stick to a solid surface such as the edge of a glass cohesive forces are those that pull liquid molecules toward each other 5 x research source the combination of adhesion and cohesive forces causes a liquid to rise up the center of a thin tube the height the liquid rises can be used to calculate the surface tension of that liquid cohesion causes water to form bubbles or droplets on a surface when a liquid is in contact with air the molecules feel attractive forces towards each other and make a bubble on the surface adhesion causes the meniscus that is seen in liquids when they cling to the sides of a glass it is the concave shape at the top of the liquid seen at eye level 6 x research source an example of capillary action is watching water rise in a straw placed in a cup of water define the equation to solve for surface tension surface tension is given by the equation s ϝhga 2 where s is the surface tension ϝ or rho is the density of the liquid you are measuring h is the height the liquid rises in the tube g is the acceleration due to gravity acting on the liquid 9 8 m s2 and a is the radius of the capillary tube 7 x research source when working through this equation make sure all of your units are in the proper metric form density in kg m3 height and radius in meters and gravity in m s2 if the density of the liquid is not given you can look it up in a reference book or calculate it using the equation density mass volume the unit for surface tension is one newton per meter n m a newton is equal to 1 kg m s2 8 x research source to work out the units on your own simply solve the equation with just units s kg m3 m m s2 m two of the meter units cancel out two of the per meter units and you are left with 1 kg m s2 m or 1 n m fill a container with the liquid of unknown surface tension using a shallow dish or bowl fill it with about an inch of the liquid in question the amount of liquid added does not matter as long as you can clearly see the rise in liquid within the capillary tube if you repeat this with different liquids make sure the dish is thoroughly cleaned and dried before adding the next liquid alternatively just use separate dishes for each liquid place a clear thin tube into the liquid this is the tube that you will take your measurements from to calculate the surface tension the tube must be clear so that you can see how far the liquid rises above the level in the dish the tube must also have the same radius throughout to measure the radius simply place a ruler across the top of the tube and determine the diameter divide the diameter by 2 and you have the radius you can buy these tubes online or from a hardware store measure the height the liquid rises above the liquid in the container place the bottom of a ruler directly above the liquid in the dish and measure how high the liquid has risen into the tube the water rises due to the upward force of surface tension being greater than the downward force of gravity 9 x research source plug the measured values into the equation and solve once you have determined all of the necessary variables you can plug them into the formula and solve for surface tension remember to convert all of your values to metric so the problem can be solved properly for example let s say we are measuring the surface tension of water water has a density around 1 kg m3 we will use approximate values in this example 10 x research source the variable g is always 9 8 m s2 the radius of the tube is 029 m and the water rises 0 5 m what is the surface tension of the water plugging the variables into the equation yields s ϝhga 2 1 x 9 8 x 0 029 x 0 5 2 0 1421 2 0 071 j m2 gather your materials for this experiment you will need an eye dropper a dry penny water a small bowl dish soap oil and a towel most of these items can be found around the house or purchased at the grocery store you don t have to use dish soap and oil but you will want different liquids to compare their surface tensions make sure the penny is completely clean and dry before beginning the experiment if there are other liquids on the penny the experiment will not be accurate this experiment does not allow you to calculate surface tension but just determine surface tensions of different liquids relative to each other drip one drop of liquid at a time onto the penny place the penny on top of a towel or a surface that you don t mind getting wet fill the eyedropper with the first liquid slowly drip the liquid onto the penny taking care to only drop one drop at a time count the number of drops it takes to fill the penny until the liquid runs over write down how many drops it takes for the liquid to flow over the side of the penny repeat the experiment with a different liquid clean and dry the penny in between each test of liquid dry the surface that you placed the penny on before repeating the experiment use multiple

how to watch a meteor shower,meteors are also known as shooting stars and they originate when earth passes near a comet s orbit and the debris particles that hit earth s atmosphere ignite when many meteors appear to originate from the same point this is called a meteor shower meteor showers can be spectacular to watch and luckily for any amateur or professional astronomer they are predictable all you will need to do is keep an eye on the dates hope for the right conditions and take along the appropriate gear for viewing,research when and where meteor showers will be occurring both the time and the location of meteor showers are predictable look online for a meteor calendar to find out what meteor showers will be happening in your area in the near future 1 x research source a meteor shower always appears from the same point in the sky which is known as the radiant the meteor shower usually gets its name from the constellation that contains that radiant meteor showers happen year round with the month of november being the most active time you can see a meteor in the night sky at any time but if you want the best chance of seeing one or many plan your outing around a meteor calendar the table above outlines the major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere region peak dates change slightly from year to year check the moon phase before you set off to view the next meteor shower that will be happening near you check a lunar calendar to figure out what phase the moon will be in on that night if the moon is too bright you may not be able to see any meteors 2 x research source avoid attempting to view meteors during the moon s full or gibbous phases the best time for viewing is when the moon is between new and first quarter as this is when it casts the least amount of light and sets before midnight confirm that the weather will be clear in addition to checking the lunar calendar you will need to check the weather forecast for the evening that you plan to view a meteor shower poor weather can easily put a damper on your meteor viewing experience 3 x research source the best conditions for watching meteor showers are dry and clear if it is very cloudy you may not be able to see any meteors if it is raining or snowing you will not only have a low chance of seeing any meteors but you will also be extremely uncomfortable sitting outside plan to stay up late or get up early if the moon phase and weather conditions are both favorable for viewing a meteor showers you will need to know exactly when to plan your meteor viewing outing meteor shower typically peak between midnight and dawn so you will have to plan on being up during the wee hours of the night take a long nap during the day if you plan to stay outside watching for more than an hour or so set an alarm to wake you up if you plan to sleep you don t want to miss out on the opportunity to view a meteor shower because you overslept find a wide open spot you need an unobstructed view of the sky to properly view a meteor shower do your best to find a spot with no buildings or trees 4 x research source parks make excellent viewing locations as long as there aren t too many trees try scouting out locations a few days prior to the meteor shower this will help ensure that you have a prime viewing location make sure your viewing location is as dark as possible light from buildings cars and street lights can make it much more difficult to see meteors get as far away from all sources of artificial light as you can for the best viewing experience if you live in the city you may have to travel farther to find a suitable viewing location the more regular stars you can see in the night sky in a given location the better that spot will be for viewing meteors consider your comfort if you want to see a meteor shower you will be sitting outside for a good amount of time so it s important to keep your basic comfort in mind watching the meteor shower will be much more enjoyable if you are well prepared and have everything you need it can get quite cold outside depending on the time of year and where you re located so don t neglect to dress warmly it s also a good idea to take blankets and warm drinks with you for cold weather viewing 5 x research source no matter what time of year you plan on watching the meteor shower during consider bringing a lightweight chair that lets you lean back this will be much more comfortable than sitting with your neck craned towards the sky 6 x research source you may also want to bring some snacks and have a late night picnic while you re stargazing bring the right viewing equipment most meteor showers can be seen easily with the naked eye so you really don t need to worry about having fancy equipment you can bring binoculars and telescopes if you like but be aware that these will limit the scope of your view this means you may be less likely to see meteors if you use them although you ll definitely get a closer look if you re lucky enough to spot one it is a good idea to bring a red tinted flashlight as this will help you see where you are going without disrupting your natural night vision 7 x research source know where to look when looking for the showers always look toward the radiant a constellation chart can help you identify where the radiant should be for each meteor shower remember that the shower is typically named after the radiant constellation relax your eyes instead of staring intently at the constellation this will help you see a larger area so you will be more likely to notice meteors in your peripheral vision consider recording what you see many astronomers enjoy recording what they see while watching a meteor shower you can do this in one of several ways depending on your own personal preferences 8 x research source you may want to simply tally the number of meteors you see using a pen and paper you can count shower meteors those that originate from the radiant or the constellation after which the meteor shower was named and non shower meteors those that originate in other locations separately if you plan on writing this down you will definitely need to use a red tinted flashlight to help you see if you don t want to have to worry about writing anything down while you re stargazing take a recording device with you and simply dictate what you see you can write it all down later if you wish if you have a digital camera with a good lens you can use it to photograph meteors although it s a good idea to read up on astro photography first,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to watch the perseid meteor shower,each year the earth passes through the debris of a comet called the swift tuttle this debris burns up in our atmosphere to form what we see as meteors or shooting stars the perseid meteor shower is at its peak during mid august during a peak at least 50 60 meteors can be observed during each hour considered the best and brightest meteor show of the year by many it s a great opportunity to go outside and check out nature s own dramatic show,set your alarm clock go out to watch at midnight or later the pre dawn hours are usually the best for viewing because the side of the earth facing the sun allows more meteors to be visible 1 x research source pack a blanket compass bug spray and snacks mittens or gloves and a warm hat are also a good idea for those who feel the cold at night bring a reclining chair if you don t fancy lying on the ground or holding your head tilted back all night find a spot away from city lights planning a camping trip at this time is a great option look towards the northeastern sky if you are unsure of your orientation use your compass or an app to get your bearings and determine which direction is northeast view the sky with your unaided vision the meteors can be seen using the naked eye for closer views use binoculars or a camera with a telescopic lens you don t have to use these to appreciate the meteors however and these can limit your field of vision causing you to miss the ongoing show if you don t know where to look look for the constellation perseus the stars of perseus form somewhat of a y or v shape and the meteors will seem to shoot outwards from a central point in this constellation they will be visible however all over the sky perseus can be found by following the bottom left star in cassiopeia the w constellation down and to the left there is a double cluster that appears the meteor shower is coming from bring along a tripod if you want to take photographs the tripod is important to provide stability during long exposures and limit the camera movement when you take the photos put the camera focus on infinity and use an open shutter over a period of minutes if your camera has this capability read wikihow s article on photographing the night sky for more information,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to watch the draconids meteor shower,the draconids meteor shower occurs every year in early october usually peaking in the first or second week of the month when the earth is passing through debris left from the comet 21p giacobini zinner it is best viewed from the northern hemisphere this meteor shower produced 200 1000 meteors per hour in 1933 and 1946 although it is usually much quieter it peaks during evening hours rather than early morning hours like other meteor showers so it s usually easier to get out and see it 1 x research source,check the dates for this year the dates when the draconids will be most visible vary from year to year but are usually sometime in the first couple of weeks of october usually between the 7th and 9th a quick google search will tell you when to be ready during the year that you want to see them 2 x research source in 2018 the shower is expected to peak on october 9th while astronomers are not predicting an especially spectacular display this year the new moon on october 9th will mean better than average visibility during the peak of the shower 3 x research source look at the weather report the meteors will be most visible on a night with very few clouds and no rain if the peak night is a cloudy one you can consider trying to see the shower on the night before or after but there s no guarantee that you ll see anything 4 x research source scout a good location the best place to see the meteor shower will be in a very dark place with lots of open sky away from the lights of cities and suburbs you may need to drive a little ways out into the country to accomplish this or you might want to seek out a national or state park if there s one near you aim for a place with a clear view of the north with no trees or tall buildings on the horizon 5 x research source there are also a variety of websites devoted to helping you find a dark site to watch the night sky without obstruction so check one of those out if you don t know of a good place 6 x research source download a stargazing app or check a constellation map there are dozens of apps many of them free that help you locate stars in the night sky and you can find plenty of maps to help online or in an astronomy book you may want to look at one in advance the meteor shower will appear to be coming from the constellation draco the dragon so it may help you to know where to look for draco 7 x research source a few good free stargazing apps include star walk 2 skyview free and star chart the dragon is located between the big dipper and the little dipper 8 x research source if you re going to use an app you ll probably want to check it before you leave home to be sure you can locate the appropriate stars looking at your phone a lot in the dark will make it hard for your eyes to adjust well enough to see the stars and meteors pack your gear you ll want something comfy to sit or lie on like a blanket or a sleeping bag depending on the weather you will probably also want lots of warm layers and maybe a thermos of a nice hot beverage you may want a chair if you re not interested in lying on the ground you ll have to tilt your head back and look straight up unless your chair reclines so you may want to pack a beach chair you could also consider lying in the bed of your truck or on the hood of your car don t bother with binoculars or a telescope you won t be able to adjust your focus fast enough to see anything 9 x research source leave in time to arrive before it gets dark in the evening many meteor showers are best viewed right before dawn but you will have better luck seeing the draconids right as it gets dark aim to be in place right before the sun sets 10 x research source avoid looking at lights to preserve your natural night vision avoid looking at the screen of your phone or other mobile device for a few minutes before you look at the sky it takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to completely adjust to the darkness after you ve been in bright light so turn off all of your light sources as soon as you arrive 11 x research source if you need to look at a light try to do it with 1 eye closed don t open that eye again until you re in the darkness the eye you closed won t have to readjust 12 x research source locate the big dipper it has 8 stars but usually only 7 of them will be visible to the naked eye look north and search for 7 stars that make up a bowl with a handle on october evenings the big dipper will be very close to the horizon if you are anywhere north of the latitude of little rock arkansas 35 degrees north latitude you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark if you re south of that latitude you may still be able to see some meteors but you should use the little dipper as a reference point 13 x research source locate the little dipper if you ve found the big dipper look nearby for the north star you can find it by looking at the bowl of the big dipper and tracing a line up from the 2 stars that make up the outer edge of the bowl the north star is the last star in the handle of the little dipper 14 x research source the little dipper will be visible at any time of night anywhere north of the tropic of cancer 23 5 degrees north latitude if you can t find the big dipper you may still be able to find the little dipper by looking north and searching for the distinctive bowl and handle shape find draco the dragon if you found both dippers you probably have a good shot at finding draco you ll need a pretty dark sky 15 x research source once you ve spotted the north star look for a long glittering chain of very faint stars that curls between the north star and the big dipper follow the chain upward to find draco s 2 brightest stars estanin and rastaban 16 x research source keep looking you may have to wait a while if you can locate draco the dragon s 2 brightest stars estanin and rastaban you can often see the meteors emerging from the head of the dragon 17 x research source you don t have to locate draco or its brightest stars in order to see the meteors if you re not positive you ve found it just keep looking in the direction of the big and little dippers and a meteor will likely catch your eye usually you can see about 10 meteors per hour if it s a very clear night 18 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to watch the leonids meteor shower,around the middle of november each year the earth crosses the orbit of the 55p tempel tuttle comet though the comet is nowhere close to earth at that time it does leave a trail of dust and rock in its orbit as the earth crosses this orbit the debris left behind by the comet hits the earth s upper atmosphere the result is a series of beautiful bright lights streaking across the sky,research the moon phases it is important to know what phase the moon is each night of the leonids shower the natural light from the moon can obstruct your view so that smaller meteors are undetectable and even bigger ones appear dim try to choose a night during the shower that the moon is in the new moon phase or as close as possible 1 x research source a full moon is the worst time to try and watch the leonids meteor shower find out the peak night for the shower the shower usually peaks around november 17th consult an astronomy website or news source to confirm the peak date for this year assuming that the moon isn t full or nearly full on this night it will be the best time to watch the shower 2 x research source the next major leonids outburst is scheduled for 2033 these outbursts are when the show is most impressive to watch 3 x research source even in years when no major outbursts are expected however you can still catch a less spectacular show on a dark clear night 4 x research source choose the darkest hours from midnight to dawn are the best hours to watch the leonids meteor shower during these hours the sky is at its darkest this makes it easier to see the meteors because there is less light interference 5 x research source pick a dark location try to get out and away from cities you want to find a place with as little light as possible and a good view of the sky keep your eye turned to the darkest part of the sky and avoid looking at any lights including a cell phone you should also give your eyes 15 minutes or more to adjust to the low light 6 x research source you could watch the shower from a mountain top or a clearing in the forest with a good view of the sky bring a lawn chair it can take a long time to spot meteors bring a lawn chair or some other outside furniture to lie back on this will help you be comfortable while you wait to catch a glimpse of the leonids meteor shower 7 x research source look for a beach chair or other outdoor chair that can recline this way you won t hurt your neck staring up at the sky cover yourself up being out all night in mid november might get cold be sure to pack a blanket or sleeping bag to cover yourself up building a fire for heat will produce too much light and prevent you from seeing the shower 8 x research source bring some drinks and snacks most skywatchers take a break every hour or so this gives you a chance to stretch your legs and refuel bring some coffee or tea and a few snacks to keep you in it for the long haul you will have to travel away from city lights and won t have the convenience of just going to the kitchen for a snack 9 x research source have a backup plan if you can t make it out to watch the leonids meteor shower you can stream it online some astronomy websites like space com stream the shower this makes it easy for anyone who can t get away from the city or doesn t want to to watch the leonids meteor shower 10 x research source record your observations many amateur and professional astronomers like to keep a journal of their observations for simple note keeping just record the time and approximate location in the sky each time you see a meteor you can use constellations as markers to help you record the location of each meteor 11 x research source keep track of your breaks you won t have your eyes on the sky the entire night you ll have coffee breaks and snack breaks you might even fall asleep at some point in the night keeping track of these times helps you know how long you were actually looking at the sky and how many meteors you saw and how many you may have missed 12 x research source if you are taking notes by hand you should even record the time that you look down to take notes you might be surprised at how much time this can be over the course of an entire night filter your flashlight you will need some light to function outside in the dark use a dim flashlight to provide this light covering the flashlight with a red filter will dim it even further and reduce the impact it has on your ability to see the meteor shower 13 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find a meteorite,the solar system is full of meteors these meteors fly around the solar system and sometimes collide into other celestial bodies including the earth some meteors burn up in the atmosphere and never make it to the surface of the earth but some do once a meteor lands on the earth s surface it is classified as a meteorite if you are interested in owning one of these space treasures you can go out and find them you just need to know where to look how to pinpoint a meteorite and how to tell them apart from other rocks,look through a database scientists and meteorite enthusiasts keep up to date records of where they find meteorites you can look online for databases such as the meteoritical society s database that show the areas that produce the most meteorite discoveries pinpointing the nearest hot spot for meteorites is a great start to finding your own choose a warm arid climate moisture and damp climates will deteriorate a meteorite relatively quickly your best shot at finding an intact meteorite is to look in a place that stays hot and dry deserts are one of the best climates to search dried up lake beds are great too 1 x research source for example more meteorites have been found in the sahara than any other place on earth get permission to search the area before you take off scouring the earth in search of meteorites take a moment to think about who owns the land you are searching if the land is owned privately you will need the owner s permission before searching it public lands follow different rules depending on the particular jurisdiction but you always need permission to search any public lands 2 x research source if it is privately owned land you need to ask the landowner for permission to be on the property if the land is publicly owned e g a park you need permission from the governing body to search it and permission to keep the meteorite if you find it some areas classify them as artifacts meaning that they belong to the municipality rather than the discoverer buy or make a meteorite stick while the name might suggest something exotic a meteorite stick is a simple stick with a magnet at the end of it you can stick the end to rocks on the ground to test for magnetic properties if a rock has magnetic properties then there s a chance that it could be a meteorite and warrants further investigation using a long stick will prevent you from continually bending over to see if individual rocks are magnetic get a good metal detector you should get a metal detector that is made to search for gold these are the most accurate metal detectors go to the location that you intend to search and run the coil of the metal detector along the ground to scan for meteorites underneath the surface 3 x research source good used metal detectors generally cost between 250 and 400 there is no need to buy a new one for a higher price the metal detector is more sensitive than a meteorite stick but less convenient to use you should keep both with you bring a gps a gps will serve you in two ways first it will help you keep track of your position in case you get lost second it allows you to mark the location of any meteorites that you find if you do find a meteorite marking its location is important this allows you to upload it to the meteorite databases and help map the location of meteorites be prepared to dig sometimes you can find meteorites just lying on the ground other times your metal detector will pick up a signal from something deep in the ground bring along a pickaxe and a spade to help you dig up any potential meteorites test the rock for magnetic properties testing the rock for magnetic properties can be done rather quickly just hold a magnet near the rock to determine if there is any interaction this can even be done with the magnet at the tip of your meteorite stick most meteorites have magnetic properties keep in mind that some terrestrial rocks also have magnetic properties observe the density of the rock because of their high iron and nickel content meteorites are rather dense they are often denser than most terrestrial rocks this can be loosely translated to being heavier than other rocks their size pick up the rock and analyze how heavy it feels versus what you would expect a rock that size to feel like look for common meteorite traits while not all meteorites share the same characteristics there are some common traits that can be found in most of them if you can identify one or more of these traits there s a good chance that you have a found a meteorite four specific traits to look for are a metallic shine on the surface of the rock small rounded pieces of stones on the surface these are known as chondrules a black or brown coating known as fusion crust this is produced by the extreme heat of flying through the atmosphere small dents covering the surface of the rock this is regmaglypt texture or thumbprints do a streak test try dragging the rock in question across a streak plate or a piece of paper if it leaves a streak it is probably a terrestrial rock if it doesn t leave a streak or if the streak is weak and gray in color it might be a meteorite a streak plate is generally made of unglazed ceramic 4 x research source you can find them online or in rock mineral testing kits,Hobbies-and-Crafts

stars that make up a bowl with a handle on october evenings the big dipper will be very close to the horizon if you are anywhere north of the latitude of little rock arkansas 35 degrees north latitude you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark if you re south of that latitude you may still be able to see some meteors but you should use the little dipper as a reference point 13 x research source locate the little dipper if you ve found the big dipper look nearby for the north star you can find it by looking at the bowl of the big dipper and tracing a line up from the 2 stars that make up the outer edge of the bowl the north star is the last star in the handle of the little dipper 14 x research source the little dipper will be visible at any time of night anywhere north of the tropic of cancer 23 5 degrees north latitude if you can t find the big dipper you may still be able to find the little dipper by looking north and searching for the distinctive bowl and handle shape find draco the dragon if you found both dippers you probably have a good shot at finding draco you ll need a pretty dark sky 15 x research source once you ve spotted the north star look for a long glittering chain of very faint stars that curls between the north star and the big dipper follow the chain upward to find draco s 2 brightest stars estanin and rastaban 16 x research source keep looking you may have to wait a while if you can locate draco the dragon s 2 brightest stars estanin and rastaban you can often see the meteors emerging from the head of the dragon 17 x research source you don t have to locate draco or its brightest stars in order to see the meteors if you re not positive you ve found it just keep looking in the direction of the big and little dippers and a meteor will likely catch your eye usually you can see about 10 meteors per hour if it s a very clear night 18 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to watch the leonids meteor shower,around the middle of november each year the earth crosses the orbit of the 55p tempel tuttle comet though the comet is nowhere close to earth at that time it does leave a trail of dust and rock in its orbit as the earth crosses this orbit the debris left behind by the comet hits the earth s upper atmosphere the result is a series of beautiful bright lights streaking across the sky,research the moon phases it is important to know what phase the moon is each night of the leonids shower the natural light from the moon can obstruct your view so that smaller meteors are undetectable and even bigger ones appear dim try to choose a night during the shower that the moon is in the new moon phase or as close as possible 1 x research source a full moon is the worst time to try and watch the leonids meteor shower find out the peak night for the shower the shower usually peaks around november 17th consult an astronomy website or news source to confirm the peak date for this year assuming that the moon isn t full or nearly full on this night it will be the best time to watch the shower 2 x research source the next major leonids outburst is scheduled for 2033 these outbursts are when the show is most impressive to watch 3 x research source even in years when no major outbursts are expected however you can still catch a less spectacular show on a dark clear night 4 x research source choose the darkest hours from midnight to dawn are the best hours to watch the leonids meteor shower during these hours the sky is at its darkest this makes it easier to see the meteors because there is less light interference 5 x research source pick a dark location try to get out and away from cities you want to find a place with as little light as possible and a good view of the sky keep your eye turned to the darkest part of the sky and avoid looking at any lights including a cell phone you should also give your eyes 15 minutes or more to adjust to the low light 6 x research source you could watch the shower from a mountain top or a clearing in the forest with a good view of the sky bring a lawn chair it can take a long time to spot meteors bring a lawn chair or some other outside furniture to lie back on this will help you be comfortable while you wait to catch a glimpse of the leonids meteor shower 7 x research source look for a beach chair or other outdoor chair that can recline this way you won t hurt your neck staring up at the sky cover yourself up being out all night in mid november might get cold be sure to pack a blanket or sleeping bag to cover yourself up building a fire for heat will produce too much light and prevent you from seeing the shower 8 x research source bring some drinks and snacks most skywatchers take a break every hour or so this gives you a chance to stretch your legs and refuel bring some coffee or tea and a few snacks to keep you in it for the long haul you will have to travel away from city lights and won t have the convenience of just going to the kitchen for a snack 9 x research source have a backup plan if you can t make it out to watch the leonids meteor shower you can stream it online some astronomy websites like space com stream the shower this makes it easy for anyone who can t get away from the city or doesn t want to to watch the leonids meteor shower 10 x research source record your observations many amateur and professional astronomers like to keep a journal of their observations for simple note keeping just record the time and approximate location in the sky each time you see a meteor you can use constellations as markers to help you record the location of each meteor 11 x research source keep track of your breaks you won t have your eyes on the sky the entire night you ll have coffee breaks and snack breaks you might even fall asleep at some point in the night keeping track of these times helps you know how long you were actually looking at the sky and how many meteors you saw and how many you may have missed 12 x research source if you are taking notes by hand you should even record the time that you look down to take notes you might be surprised at how much time this can be over the course of an entire night filter your flashlight you will need some light to function outside in the dark use a dim flashlight to provide this light covering the flashlight with a red filter will dim it even further and reduce the impact it has on your ability to see the meteor shower 13 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tell whether the moon is waxing or waning,the moon takes 27 3 days to orbit the earth but the full lunar cycle takes a full 29 5 days to complete throughout the cycle the moon will be waxing each day or increasing how much of it you can see lit up at night then waning or decreasing in size until it disappears wherever it is in the cycle there are key clues hidden in the moon s shape that can help indicate whether it is in the waxing or waning process this can in turn give you information about the moon s phase the tides and where the moon is in relation to the earth and the sun whether you re hoping to see the moon in a certain phase or meet the man on the moon knowing whether the moon is waxing or waning is easy with some simple astronomical tricks,learn the names of the phases the moon revolves around the earth and as it does we see different angles of the moon s illuminated surface the moon doesn t create its own light but rather shines when it reflects the sun s light 1 x research source as the moon transitions from new to full and back to new again it goes through several phases marked by its recognizable crescent and gibbous bulging shapes which are created by the moon s own shadow 2 x research source the moon phases are new moon waxing crescent first quarter half moon waxing gibbous full moon waning gibbous third quarter half moon waning crescent new moon 3 x research source learn what the phases mean the moon travels the same path around the earth every month so it goes through the same monthly phases the phases exist because from our perspective on earth we observe the illuminated portion of the moon differently as it makes its way around us remember that half the moon is always illuminated by the sun it s our vantage point on earth that changes and determines what phase we see 4 x research source during the new moon the moon is between the earth and the sun and is therefore not illuminated at all from our perspective at this time the moon s illuminated side completely faces the sun and we see the side that s in full shadow during the first quarter we see half of the moon s illuminated side and half of the moon s shadowed side the same is true in the third quarter except the sides we see are reversed 5 x research source when the moon appears full we see its full illuminated half while the side that s in complete shadow faces out into space after the full moon the moon continues its journey back to its original position between the earth and the sun which is another new moon it takes the moon a little over 27 32 days to complete one full revolution around the earth however a full lunar month from new moon to new moon is 29 5 days because that s how long it takes the moon to return to its position between the sun and earth 6 x research source learn why the moon waxes and wanes on the moon s journey from new moon to full moon we see a growing portion of its illuminated half and this is called the waxing phase waxing means growing or increasing as the moon then goes from full to new again we see a diminishing portion of its illuminated half and this is called waning which means decreasing in strength or intensity the moon s phases always look the same so although the moon itself may appear in different locations and orientations in the sky you ll always be able to identify what phase it s in if you know what to look for recognize that the moon waxes and wanes from right to left different parts of the moon are illuminated during waxing and waning in the northern hemisphere the part of the moon that is illuminated will appear to grow from right to left until it s full and it will then diminish from right to left a waxing moon will be illuminated on the right side and a waning moon will be illuminated on the left side 7 x research source hold out your right hand with your thumb out palm facing the sky the thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward c if the moon fits in this curve it s a waxing moon increasing if you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the c curve then it is waning decreasing remember d o c since the moon always follows the same illumination pattern you can use the shape of the letters d o and c to determine if the moon is waxing or waning during the first quarter the moon will look like a d when it s full it will look like an o and when it s in the third quarter it will look like a c a crescent moon in the shape of a backwards c is waxing a half or gibbous moon in the shape of a d is waxing a half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards d is waning a crescent moon in the shape of a c is waning learn when the moon rises and sets the moon doesn t always rise and set at the same time but changes depending on what phase it s in this means you can use the time of moonrise and moonset to determine if the moon is waxing or waning you can t see a new moon because it isn t illuminated by the sun and because it rises and sets at the same time as the sun as the waxing moon moves into its first quarter it will rise in the morning reach its height around dusk and set around midnight full moons come up when the sun goes down and set when the sun comes up as the waning moon moves into its third quarter it will rise at midnight and set in the morning 8 x research source learn which part of the moon is illuminated during waxing and waning in opposition to the moon in the northern hemisphere the moon in the southern hemisphere will illuminate from left to right become full and then diminish from left to right a moon that s illuminated on the left side is waxing while a moon that s illuminated on the right side is waning 9 x research source hold out your right hand with your thumb out palm facing the sky the thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward c if the moon fits in this curve it s a waning moon decreasing if you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the c curve then it is waxing increasing remember c o d the moon goes through all the same phases in the southern hemisphere but the shapes of the letters that indicate waxing and waning are reversed from the northern hemisphere a crescent moon in the shape of a c is waxing a half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards d is waxing a moon in the shape of an o is full a half or gibbous moon in the shape of a d is waning a crescent moon in the shape of a backwards c is waning learn when the moon rises and sets although the moon may illuminate in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere versus the northern it will still rise and set at the same times during the same phases the first quarter moon will rise in the morning and set around midnight the full moon rises and sets when the sun sets and rises the third quarter moon will rise at midnight and set in the morning 10 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make a moon phases chart,it takes the moon roughly 29 5 days to orbit the earth during its orbit different portions of the moon are visible these portions are referred to as moon phases since the moon s orbit is a predictable pattern it is possible to chart the phases of the moon this can be a great way to study the moon in depth or to introduce children to the cycles of the moon,make a 2d chart or a 3d chart use white construction paper cut in circles and color in the moon phases with markers or use halves of styrofoam balls glued to posterboard to make a 3d representation color in the foam balls with a black marker to show the waxing and waning of the moon phases know the phases of the moon this is vital to being able to create an accurate chart there are eight main phases of the moon each lasting roughly 3 5 days the phase of the moon depends upon the way in which the moon is positioned in relation to the sun and earth at any given time the eight phases are 1 x research source new moon waxing crescent first quarter waxing gibbous full moon waning gibbous last quarter waning crescent place earth in the center of your chart different positions of the moon relative to the earth and sun produce the visible phases of the moon the moon phases chart is designed to describe the visibility of the moon at different points as it orbits the earth by placing earth in the center of your chart you keep this concept in perspective 2 x research source place the sun on your chart the sun is typically placed on the right side of the chart this is important because the moon phase depends upon the moon s relation to both the earth and the sun if you place the sun to the left of the earth you would have to move all of the moon phases to match this new position 3 x research source the relationship of these three bodies is important but the actual determination of right or left side is arbitrary the earth orbits the sun and the sun is never at a stationary left or right in relation to the earth start with the new moon the new moon occurs when the moon is directly between the earth and the sun draw or fasten a new moon all dark shadowed directly between the earth and sun 4 x research source in astrology the new moon symbolizes birth or new beginnings it is thought to be a good time to start a new project 5 x research source place the waxing crescent from the point of the new moon move counterclockwise by 45 degrees to draw or place the waxing crescent this moon phase occurs when the moon has moved through roughly ⅛ of its orbit less than three days after the new moon at this point in the orbit there is a sliver of the moon that is lit by the sun s light and visible to the side of the earth experiencing night pointing away from the sun 6 x research source the crescent phase is often associated with struggle and growth in astrology it is thought to be a good time to take opportunities 7 x research source attach the first quarter move counterclockwise 90 degrees from the new moon or 45 degrees from the waxing crescent to place or draw the first quarter moon when the moon appears as a half circle in the sky this is known as a quarter moon because the moon has moved through ¼ of its orbit this moon phase can be observed around seven to ten days into the moon s cycle 8 x research source astrological themes surrounding the first quarter phase are action and expression it is considered a good time to take the first steps to communicate your goals and achieve them 9 x research source pin the waxing gibbous move another 45 degrees counterclockwise 135 degrees from the new moon to place the waxing gibbous during this phase the moon moves closer and closer to being a full circle in the sky the waxing gibbous is observed from roughly eleven to fourteen days into the moon cycle 10 x research source during the waxing gibbous phase astrologists suggest that you focus on analyzing the results of the actions that you initiated in the first quarter phase start with a full moon the full moon is the climax of the waxing phases it is also the beginning of the waning phases as the moon continues its orbit it will become less and less visible the placement of the full moon on your chart should be 180 degrees from the new moon straight across from the new moon on the other side of the earth 11 x research source astrologically the full moon represents illumination during this phase it is thought that one will have a clear view of their previous actions so that they can make appropriate adjustments 12 x research source attach the waning gibbous the waning gibbous should be placed 45 degrees counterclockwise with respect to the full moon stages of the waning gibbous appear to be inverted from stages of the waxing gibbous the parts of the moon that were dark at a given phase of the waxing gibbous will be light at a similar phase of the waning gibbous and vice versa 13 x research source in astrology the waning gibbous is also referred to as the disseminating moon it is considered a time to reflect upon any changes made during the full moon phase 14 x research source place the third quarter moon the third quarter moon should be placed 90 degrees counterclockwise from the full moon the third quarter moon appears as the inverse of the first quarter moon this phase marks the point at which the moon has traveled through ¾ of its orbit 15 x research source the third quarter moon or last quarter moon is considered a time for revising and cleansing by astrologists it is thought to be the time to bring closure to projects started during the new moon phase 16 x research source pin the waning crescent the waning crescent is the last moon phase in the cycle it should be placed on the chart 135 degrees counterclockwise from the full moon 45 degrees counterclockwise from the waning gibbous this will complete a circle around the earth with eight different points representing the eight moon phases 17 x research source in astrology the waning crescent is also known as the balsamic moon this is considered a time to let go and release any things that do not pertain to the next moon cycle provide explanations below the chart explain each moon phase in a caption this way anyone reading the chart can immediately work out which phase of the moon they are looking at and why it is named that for example new moon this is the beginning of the moon phases when the moon is hidden from sight waxing crescent this is the sliver of a crescent when the moon begins to be visible first quarter appears as a half circle in the sky waxing gibbous more than half of a circle is illuminated as the moon moves toward a full moon full moon the entire moon appears lit up by the sun so you can see a whole circle waxing gibbous the illumination of the moon starts to shrink again last quarter appears as a half circle in the sky waning crescent the last phase of the moon as it becomes less and less

how to find planets in the night sky,finding planets in the night sky is a rewarding ability that lets you have a deeper knowledge of the universe if you know what you are looking for because the night sky is an ever changing display you ll have to learn how to distinguish planets from non planets when you look up what you see will also depend on where you are on earth what time of year or night it is when you observe and if you are using just your eyes or a special instrument to see with all that in mind the next time you look out into the night sky you might be able to make out another planet,distinguish stars from planets planets are usually much brighter than stars they are closer to earth so they begin to look more like a disk rather than a tiny dot 1 x research source look for the bright planets although some of the planets may be in their apparition period they may be harder to see if they aren t one of the brighter planets jupiter and saturn will always be the easiest to see know what color you re looking for each planet reflects the light of the sun differently know what color you re looking for in the night sky mercury this planet twinkles flashing a bright yellow color venus venus is often mistaken for a ufo because it is large and silver mars this planet is a reddish color jupiter jupiter glows white throughout the night it is the second brightest point of light in the night sky 2 x research source saturn a smaller planet that is yellowish white in color learn how the lights affect the sky it is easier to see the stars and planets in the night sky if you live in a rural area if you re in the city it will be much more difficult to see them because of light pollution try to find a spot away from stray light that shines off of buildings 3 x research source look in the right part of the sky the planets are rarely near one another in the night sky knowing where to see them is very important a great way to find them is to locate them when they appear as part of a constellation mercury mercury will be visible near the sun you ll lose it in the sun s glare for most of the year but it will return to view in the middle of august 4 x research source mars look low in the morning sky mars moves eastward jupiter jupiter is always located very far away from the sun saturn look low in the libra constellation to see this bright planet take your position on earth into consideration the planets may have an apparition period but may earlier in the eastern hemisphere and later in the night in the western hemisphere when you look at the apparition periods take into consideration what part of the earth you re on find your planet s apparition period the apparition period is the time that your planet is visible it can last anywhere from a few weeks to almost two years you can look these up in most astronomy catalogues to figure out when your planets are visible know what time to look most of the planets are most visible as the sky gets dark dusk or as the sky begins to brighten again dawn however looking for them in the night sky is also possible you have to look very late at night when it is incredibly dark out 5 x research source know when your planets are visible each night combine their apparition period with the time that they are most visible to determine when will be the best time to see the planet you re looking for mercury this planet is visible multiple times a year this year it will still be visible in september and december mars the early morning sky will showcase mars starting in august mars will begin to climb higher into to sky and continue through the rest of the year it will become brighter as it climbs 6 x research source jupiter pre dawn skies are the best time to see jupiter it will appear in the 2015 sky in mid september and continue for months inside the borders of leo 7 x research source saturn look in the evening twilight sky for saturn saturn will appear in the night sky in november and will be visible in the morning sky by the year s end 8 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to tell the difference between planets and stars,the night sky is full of light most of which is generated by celestial bodies like stars and planets if you can t tell whether an object in the sky is a star or planet you ll want to learn how to distinguish between the physical features of these two celestial bodies and when it s best to view them,check if the object twinkles one of the easiest ways to distinguish between stars and planets in the night sky is by looking to see if the object twinkles or shimmers this can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough 1 x research source stars twinkle and shimmer hence the song twinkle twinkle little star planets do not twinkle they remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky if viewed through a telescope planets may appear to wiggle along the edges 2 x research source any object that blinks twinkles or shimmers is most likely a star however it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky note whether the object rises and sets celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky all celestial bodies move but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they re stars or planets 3 x research source planets rise in the east and set in the west they tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon stars move around in the night sky but they do not rise or set instead they orbit in a circular pattern around polaris the north star if the celestial object you see appears to move in a more or less straight line across the night sky it is most likely a planet satellites also move across the night sky but they do so much more quickly than planets a planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes identify the ecliptic planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic this belt is not actually a visible object but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated while stars may also appear along this invisible belt they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance 4 x research source of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars this is due to their proximity to the sun since their brightness is just reflected sunlight the easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the earth the sun s path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic 5 x research source observe the color not all planets are colorful however many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration this can help differentiate the planets from stars while some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range 6 x research source for most people stars appear white to the naked eye 7 x research source mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color 8 x research source venus appears pale yellow mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red this is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of mars which changes on a two year cycle 9 x research source jupiter appears orange with white bands saturn typically appears pale gold in color uranus and neptune appear pale blue however they are not usually visible to the naked eye compare the relative brightness while planets and stars both light up the night sky planets typically appear much brighter than many stars 10 x research source astronomers measure the relative brightness of celestial objects using the astronomical magnitude scale with most of the planets falling in the range of objects that are easily visible to the naked eye 11 x research source planets reflect the bright light of our solar system s sun which is relatively close to the earth stars by contrast emit their own light while some stars may be much brighter and larger than our sun these stars are much farther from the earth than the planets in our solar system because of this the planets which reflect our sun s light typically appear brighter from the earth bring star charts and planetary guides whether you have poor night vision or are simply confused about the location of certain celestial bodies a chart or guide can help you determine where to look you can purchase star charts and planetary guides from a bookstore print out free guides from the internet or download a star planetary guide app on your smartphone 12 x research source remember that star charts are usually only valid for a limited period of time typically about one month that s because the position of stars in the sky changes over time as the earth continues along its orbit if you consult a star chart or planetary guide out in the field make sure you use a dim red flashlight these flashlights are designed to provide light without affecting your eyes ability to adjust to the darkness get a good telescope or binoculars if stargazing with the naked eye isn t getting you enough celestial body views you may want to consider using a telescope or binoculars these instruments can help assist your view by magnifying the area you look at this can make visible objects clearer and can even bring objects invisible to the naked eye into your view 13 x research source some experts recommend getting familiar with celestial bodies using the naked eye then trying binoculars and finally moving up to using a telescope this can help you get more acclimated to the visible bodies and their place in the night sky compare telescopes and binoculars online before you invest in one read the reviews written by people who have owned a given model by searching online for the model you re interested in visit a dark sky site light pollution from urban areas can drastically limit your ability to see celestial bodies in the night sky to really maximize visibility you may want to consider visiting a dark sky site 14 x research source these designated sites have been identified by the international dark sky association ida as places worth protecting against encroaching light pollution and urban development 15 x research source common dark sky sites include state and national parks though other dark sky sites are surrounded by well lit well developed regions check the ida website to find a dark sky site near you check whether an occultation is scheduled an occultation is when the moon passes between the earth and a given star or planet obstructing that celestial body s visibility these obstructions happen somewhat regularly and can easily be planned around since their occurrence is predictable 16 x research source occultations may be visible from some locations on earth and not from others check in advance to see whether an occultation is scheduled and whether your visibility will be significantly affected you can find out about planned occultations by searching online or by consulting an astronomy guide the international occultation timing association publishes their predictions online for free 17 x research source identify the moon s phase light reflected off the moon can inhibit your ability to see stars and planets if it is close to a full moon you may have a hard time observing celestial bodies for this reason it s best to check on the current phase of the moon before venturing out to observe the night sky 18 x research source if you aren t sure about the moon s current phase you can consult an online guide to the moon s phases for free the u s navy s website allows you to check moon phases by date as far in advance as the year 2100 19 x research source find the right conditions knowing how to distinguish between stars and planets will only get you so far if the night sky is not very visible your ability to see celestial bodies can be limited by a number of factors both man made and naturally occurring 20 x research source light pollution is one of the biggest limiting factors of night sky visibility if you live in or near a metropolitan area you will probably need to travel to a more rural area to increase visibility cloud cover and significant snow cover can both affect night sky visibility if it s very cloudy or if the ground is significantly covered in snow you may have a hard time seeing celestial bodies in the sky avoid other limiting factors there are many other factors can also affect night sky visibility including some that you might be inflicting upon yourself for example your level of alcohol consumption your nicotine consumption and your pupil dilation at the time of viewing can all affect your ability to see celestial bodies these factors all affect your eyes ability to adjust to the dark and identify stars and planets in the night sky 21 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find saturn,lots of amateur astronomers and even seasoned stargazers will say that saturn is the most beautiful point of light in our celestial sphere after seeing the cartoon version looking at the real thing is an incredible sight it s not the easiest planet to find in a night sky full of beautiful stars but earning a bit about saturn s orbit will help you to find good viewing conditions anticipate it s location and make finding saturn a lot easier see step 1 for more instructions,learn saturn s relation to earth s rotation earth rotates around the sun once a year while it takes saturn about twenty nine and a half years to make the same rotation saturn is visible for at least part of every year when earth passes between saturn and the sun 1 x research source depending on the time of year and the relation of our planets saturn may be easier or more difficult to locate in the night sky locate saturn s future path of travel if you want to locate saturn it would be difficult to just point your telescope into the sky and start blindly sweeping around you have to know where to look as well as what to look for consult a star chart that displays the path of saturn and pick a time that it will be nearest a recognizable constellation 2 x research source starting in 2014 saturn can be seen close to the constellation libra moving on later that year to scorpius in may of 2015 saturn will retrograde meaning it will move from east to west back toward libra this would be a prime viewing opportunity to find saturn over the next ten years saturn will move steadily east in the sky of the northern hemisphere toward capricornus during a period of 2017 saturn will become invisible to stargazers from earth as it will be too close to the sun for us to see it pick a date when saturn is opposed to the sun the opposition refers to the projected point at which saturn will be closest to the earth and brightest in the sky this occurs roughly once every 378 days during its oppositional period saturn will be due south in the northern hemisphere and due north in the southern hemisphere most visible around midnight local time oppositional dates from 2014 2022 are may 10 2014 may 23 2015 june 3 2016 june 15 2017 june 27 2018 july 9 2019 july 20 2020 august 2 2021 august 14 2022 locate the constellation nearest saturn s current position to use as a guide when you ve gotten a sense of saturn s path you ll first need to locate a constellation to use as a focal point to start scanning from basically you want to familiarize yourself with the constellation its closest to and then use a chart of saturn s position to find out exactly where to look in relation to that star in 2014 that constellation will be libra while in january of 2016 it will be directly north of the antares star in the constellation scorpius you can look at saturn s path here http www nakedeyeplanets com saturn htm if you re viewing on an oppositional date aim your telescope due south look for a golden color shining steadily typically saturn will appear to have a yellowish golden hue and won t twinkle like stars do because saturn is a planet it may not be as bright or instantly noticeable as some stars because it doesn t shimmer use your constellation as a point of reference and look for a color difference use a telescope while saturn itself is visible with the naked eye it s a shame to try to find it and not be able to enjoy its distinctive rings which are visible with a basic telescope using a telescope will make the job much easier as saturn will appear to be a distinctly different shape than other bodies in the sky if you ve got a powerful telescope with a yellow filter that can help isolate the particular light in saturn s spectrum making it easier and more pleasurable to see 3 x research source look for the dark edges the planet will be darkened with shadow from the rings giving an almost 3 dimensional appearance and an oblong quality when seen through a telescope check out the rings if you ve got a good enough telescope to see the rings you ll notice that they ll look flat but create a more rounded and marble like quality to the planet itself you should also be able to distinguish between the a outside and b inside ring belts on the planet which are pretty much the coolest thing in the sky 4 x research source check out the moons aside from its famous rings saturn is also notable for the presences of its many moons which are often visible in the foreground of the planet if the viewing conditions are right and you ve got a powerful enough telescope there s even an app for that 5 x research source get familiar with basic stargazing you don t have to be looking for anything in particular to get started but it helps to develop some familiarity with basic constellations and star charts get away from the city if you live in an urban environment it s important to get away from light pollution that keeps much of the night sky invisible to even halfway decent telescopes or binoculars find a good viewing location or join other amateur astronomers in your town to get tips about trips or clubs you might hook up with go stargazing on good viewing nights there s nothing more frustrating than getting your gear together checking over all your charts packing the hot cocoa and then poof the clouds roll in make sure you ve picked a night with good weather and a relatively clear sky keep abreast of the weather patterns during the time of year you hope to find constellations or planets start with binoculars binoculars are an easy way to get started as an amateur astronomer if you don t have access to a telescope use any old pair of binoculars they re user friendly and often just as good as cheaper telescopes once you ve gotten comfortable finding things in the night sky and you want to up the ante a bit consider investing in a good quality telescope for viewing consider splitting the cost of a good one with some other astronomers and sharing the use of it to view saturn a basic telescope would be more than sufficient for the beginner if you want to get fancy though nexstar features telescope in the 800 range that locate objects in the sky for you by programming them in while a professional 11 inch schmidt cassegrain runs in the neighborhood of 1 200 get something to match your budget and commitment visit an observatory in your area astronomers are an enthusiastic bunch usually excited to share their knowledge there s no substitute for learning from the experts especially if you re interested in finding an object in the sky with as many variables as saturn look at their calendar and plan on making a visit during a particularly ripe viewing period for whatever you re interested in seeing then use the techniques and advice they offer in your future stargazing sessions if you want to make a pilgrimage griffith observatory in los angeles is probably the most famous observatory in america

how to find the planets,since ancient times before the advent of the telescope astronomers and others were able to pick out moving points of light that looked different from stars these are the planets which can be located in the night sky with the naked eye or an affordable telescope you can see mercury venus jupiter saturn and mars you can try locating the planets on your own but smartphone and computer applications may help as the night sky changes with the time of year it may be helpful to have an interactive map on your phone or computer,choose the right time if you want to observe the planets with your naked eye timing is key the best time to look for planets is roughly 45 minutes before sunrise depending on the time of year and your location the precise timing of sunrise will vary you may want to spend a few days tracking sunrise before attempting to observe the planets so you ll know a good time to go out 1 x research source you can find out what time the sun will rise in the newspaper online or using a weather app pick a good location you will want to choose a location where you can look in the rough direction of the sunrise this means there should be no buildings trees or other landmarks blocking your view pick a spot with the least amount of light pollution 2 x research source if you live in a rural area it should be fairly easy to find a location free of obstruction however make sure you watch out for larger trees as these can block your view of the planets if you live in an urban area you can try standing on a large structure like a rooftop or parking garage this can allow you to see over the buildings to observe the planets consult a star map while the planets generally fall near the sunrise and their order remains the same their precise location changes by season you may have to look farther east some times of the year to properly see the planets you can purchase a star map or star atlas at a bookstore which will provide you with varying maps of the skyline by season and location you can also find star maps online many of which will be calibrated to the current season and your location it s a good idea to review a star map before you set out to view the planets 3 x research source look for venus and jupiter venus will the easiest planet to find with the naked eye as it s by far the brightest jupiter is the second brightest so it will also be fairly easy to locate if you look slightly to the south of the sun you should see what looks like an abnormally bright star in the sky this is actually venus if you look slightly farther south you should see another bright star this is jupiter 4 x research source the location of venus and jupiter will change by season and it may be easier to find in the months of january and february consult your star map to calibrate for your time of year locate mercury near venus mercury is the planet closest to the sun if you look slightly to the lower left of venus you will see another brighter star in the sky this is mercury 5 x research source mercury can be particularly hard to find as it s not as bright as the other planets mercury sometimes hides behind twilight or clouds unfortunately if the sky is not clear you may not be able to locate mercury with the naked eye keep looking for saturn and mars saturn and mars will be located between venus and jupiter they may not always be visible to the naked eye in the months of february and january they may be easier to spot saturn will be closer to venus while mars will be closer to jupiter 6 x research source you can use color to find saturn and mars saturn will have a yellowish glow that distinguishes it from other stars mars will appear rusty or reddish in color keep in mind it s difficult to find saturn and mars during certain times of the year sometimes they may not be visible with the naked eye at all consult your star map before going out to see if it s possible to find saturn and mars that morning examine mercury with binoculars as mercury is not particularly bright and is often obscured by clouds you may need binoculars to find it try pointing a pair of binoculars into the sky and moving them slightly to the lower left of venus you may be able to find a small bright star like object this is mercury 7 x research source you do not necessarily need expensive binoculars however if you enjoy stargazing bird watching and observing wildlife you may want to invest in a more expensive brand decent binoculars can go for 200 and may give you a better view of all the planets mercury is very close to the sun so be careful when using binoculars if you point your binoculars into the sun by mistake you could cause damage to your retinas prepare your telescope if you want to get a more up close look of the planets try using a telescope you can buy a telescope online and then use it to locate the planets 8 x research source before going out to observe the planets follow the instructions manual to set up your telescope at home make sure you spend some time familiarizing yourself with the new device see how the knobs and handles work reading the manual as necessary you don t want to be confused as to how to use your telescope when you re trying to find planets look at venus up close through a telescope once you re comfortable using your telescope take it out around 45 minutes before sunrise to observe the planets as with looking at the planets with the naked eye it s best to start with venus you can easily locate venus with the naked eye as it s the bright star a little to the south of the coming sunrise once you ve found venus you can point your telescope towards it and observe 9 x research source venus takes many different shapes and colors depending on the time of year it s a good idea to consult a star atlas to get a sense of what venus will look like during the time of year you re observing so you know what to look for keep in mind that while telescopes will enhance your view of the planets you will not receive images on par with something from the hubble telescope most images you see in the night sky will appear grayish and somewhat distant even with the aid of a telescope use your telescope to examine the cloud belts and moons of jupiter once you ve found venus you can swing your telescope to the right you can get a great view of jupiter by looking through a telescope as you ll be able to see its belts and some of its moons 10 x research source you may see 2 dusty rings in jupiter s midsection these are the belts of jupiter which you can observe closely with a telescope you may also see a few moons on either side of the planet which are somewhat aligned with the belt use smartphone applications as the night sky changes so much based on the time of year it can be tough to locate the planets you can download applications on your smartphone that provide you with an interactive map of the solar system if you have an android you can download an application called stellarium this application provides an interactive 3d map of the solar system based on the time of year stellarium can also help you identify objects in the sky such as planets if you point your phone at an unknown object 11 x research source for an iphone or ipad try skyguide this is an interactive map similar to what you would find on stellarium you can take your phone with you when stargazing to help identify and locate the planets 12 x research source download an application for your computer you can also put a map of the solar system on the desktop of your computer before you go stargazing you can simply consult your desktop to get an idea of where to look for that night stellarium in addition to being available on mobile phones can be downloaded on a desktop for macs an application called photopils can be used to map the night sky on your desktop 13 x research source try using a star atlas if you feel like the presence of technology would distract from your stargazing experience try investing in a star atlas star atlases have been around for a long time they are books that break down the location of stars and plants based on location and time of year you can purchase a star atlas online check one out from your local library or buy one at a bookstore star atlases provide maps based on time of year and region you ll need to look in the book s index to find the proper map for your needs when going out stargazing take the proper star map with you and use it as a guide make sure you know how to read your star map each star map is slightly different in terms of keys for example in one star map red dots may be used to signify planets in another blue dots may be used,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to observe mercury,mercury is the least observed planet in our entire solar system however it is still possible to observe mercury in orbit even though mercury is the smallest planet and the planet closest to the sun there are many ways to find ways of viewing mercury from understanding mercury s orbit to researching viewing apparatuses to consulting astronomy blogs knowing when and where to look for mercury will also help you find the right viewing tools to be able to observe our most mysterious neighbor,consult astronomical calendars mercury is the closest planet to the sun which means that it is often in the sun s glare and hardly seen however there are specific times and seasons where the orbits of the earth and mercury place mercury high above the horizon line what months and at what times of the day mercury is visible is entirely dependent on your location on earth but most calendars will divide viewing months and times into hemispheres 1 x research source mercury is best observed in the northern hemisphere during the evening in april and may and during the morning in october and november 2 x research source in the southern hemisphere you can best observe mercury about 2 hours before dawn in april and may 3 x research source in june and july look for mercury in the evenings 4 x research source look up astronomical calendars online or go to your local bookstore and purchase a book on astronomy 5 x research source try using sites like the society for popular astronomy or books like stargazing for beginners look up sky charts and star maps sky charts and star maps will help you plot and visualize the elongation points of mercury s orbit sky charts and maps can also indicate where on the horizon line you should begin looking for mercury how long mercury will be visible and how bright it will be at various points in its orbit research sky charts and star maps online or go to your local bookstore to check for an astronomy section try using apps like star chart or sky map on your smartphone avoid observing mercury in the daytime attempting to observe mercury during the day can be dangerous as mercury is the closest planet to the sun in our solar system not only will mercury be very difficult to observe during the day you may risk serious and permanent damage to your eyes mercury is best observed after periods of twilight have ended try to spot mercury with your naked eye mercury can generally be observed with a naked eye as it has the sun as a bright backdrop mercury is best observed with the naked eye during times right before and after the sun has set which gives enough light pollution to contrast the shadow of mercury a general time to try and view mercury with your naked eye is 90 minutes before sunrise or after sunset 6 x research source if you find that the sky is still too bright to view with your naked eye or not bright enough in the early morning wait 10 minutes and try again 7 x research source use a pair of binoculars binoculars will help you observe mercury as light begins to fade into twilight the more the sun fades the less defined mercury will become try having a pair of binoculars on hand while you are observing mercury with your naked eye so that you can transition once your eyes begin to strain 8 x research source there are many online references like sky and telescope that provide detailed suggestions for binoculars geared toward specific planets are stars you want to view 9 x research source use a telescope using a telescope will allow you for a closer and more detailed view of mercury when observable however a telescope will also prolong the amount of time you will be able to observe mercury as it becomes gradually more difficult to observe during its crescent phases 10 x research source to see the surface of mercury you will need to magnify your telescope to 200x 250x 11 x research source look online or at local cultural centers to find a stargazing club or group that owns a telescope check to see if there is an observatory close to you,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to track jupiter s moons,repeating galileo s classic observation of jupiter s moons is a fun and educational activity use a mobile app and a telescope to locate the planet find its 4 large moons and plot their positions every night by making a simple graph this will help you learn about the solar system s mathematical order and repeat the classic galilean observation,get a telescope if you don t already have a telescope even a common small 60 mm refractor will allow you to see jupiter s cloud bands and moons you can find this type of beginner telescope for between 50 and 100 us dollars depending on quality 1 x research source more powerful telescopes that are still great for beginners can cost upwards of 300 to 400 us dollars but provide better imaging some even interface with a tablet or smartphone allowing you to easily track the sky using your mobile device 2 x research source consider using binoculars if you don t have a telescope but do own a good pair of binoculars you can use them to see jupiter s moons you ll need a pair with a minimum of 7x magnification or 7 times more powerful than human vision while they ll only be visible as tiny dots you should be able to make out the moons clearly 3 x research source a good pair of modern binoculars is about as powerful as the telescope galileo used when he first discovered jupiter s 4 large moons io europa ganymede and callisto find a star chart or app you can find a star chart or almanac online that will give you the locations of stars and planets on a given night even easier you can download a mobile app that automatically locates a specific celestial body 4 x research source skysafari and google sky map both allow you to search for your stellar object and help you locate it in your patch of sky jupitermoons for ios lets you find jupiter s location in the sky and current appearance 5 x research source get graph paper or a tracking sheet you ll need lined graphing paper in order to track the moons transits over the course of several nights a pencil will also come in handy and if you d like you can use 4 different colored pencils to distinguish the moons when you graph them you can also download a moon tracking activity sheet online 6 x research source set aside the same observation time for at least a week to track jupiter and its moons you ll need to observe at the same time within a 30 minute window every day for 7 9 days sticking to the same observation time will ensure the accuracy of your results make sure you have time to set aside to make your observations and hopefully the weather will cooperate with your experiment 7 x research source unless you live in a dense urban environment you will most likely be able to observe jupiter without having to go to a dark isolated location your backyard should work just fine while tracking the moons over the course of nine days is best you can also make several observations over the course of 6 hours to track minor changes in their orbits and jupiter s shifting position in the night sky find jupiter in the sky use your sky chart or mobile app to find out when jupiter will be observable while it s visible to the naked eye you ll have to make sure it s observable at your location 8 x research source for example if jupiter appears near the western horizon in the evening it s too close to the setting sun to be observable you can easily find out online when jupiter will be visible for a given year at http www nakedeyeplanets com visibility htm aim your telescope at jupiter once you ve found jupiter with your chart or app and have spotted it with your naked eye you ll need to point your telescope on it focus on the planet and center it in the eyepiece you should be able to see from 1 to 4 moons all of which should be in a straight line 9 x research source some of the moons may be behind jupiter or so close to each other that they appear to be a single object graph the moons on a piece of graph paper draw a vertical line to represent the position of jupiter make a large dot representing jupiter on the vertical line you drew then skip several lines down and make another large dot proceed to make jupiter dots for as many days as you ll be making observations and label each area with a date or day of the week once you ve drawn your jupiter dots go to the first one and plot the moons relative to the vertical line for example graph the moon that s closest to jupiter 1 line to the left or right of the jupiter dot depending on what you observe graph the next closest moon 2 lines away from the dot and so on to find out which moon is which cross check them with your jupiter mobile app and color code them using colored pencils repeat this observation for at least a week while 7 9 days will give you usable data making observations for a month or more will increase the accuracy of your measurements each dot you drew will help you make your graph for that day so on the second day of your observations plot the moons relative to the second jupiter dot be sure to continue to use your labeling or color coding system to keep track of each moon if you cannot observe on a certain day skip the graph for that day connect the observations with a line draw a line to connect each moon s daily positions when you do this correctly you trace out a wave pattern called a sine wave now you have a graph of the moon s positions over time you can even use this pattern to predict the moons positions over several years 10 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to observe mars,mars the red planet is particularly visible in the night sky every two years when it reaches the closest distance to earth in its orbit to best observe the planet track its orbit and try to view it during peak times and ideal weather conditions while you can observe the planet s color and brightness with the naked eye a telescope is necessary to see all of its finer features if you decide to purchase one do your research look for a model with a high aperture and look into color filters make the most of your observation of mars by carefully viewing all of its distinguishable features and sketching the planet,track mars orbit for optimal viewing of mars track its orbit with a sky map or chart to keep track of its distance from earth a sky map is a map of the night sky that indicates the location of planets stars constellations and other celestial bodies 1 x research source interactive versions are available online for example visit http www sky map org or you can download an app for your smartphone make sure to get the right map for your current location and for the current date 2 x research source view mars on the date of opposition mars closest approach to earth occurs every 26 months but it appears the brightest eight days earlier on the date of opposition this date marks the point in the planet s orbit when it rises in the east as the sun sets which makes it visible in our sky overnight while there are many other opportunities to view mars in the night sky this biennial event should not be missed if you are truly interested in observing the planet 3 x research source aim for ideal weather conditions ensure that the weather will be favorable and the skies will be clear for the night and time when you intend to observe mars cloudy skies and certainly precipitation will impede your viewing consult a local weather report or a clear sky chart online to predict weather conditions for the near future 4 x research source research telescopes a telescope is a pricey but integral part of observing mars so you should put a good deal of thought into choosing one as a general rule you should be focused on finding a telescope with good optics and a sturdy mount that moves smoothly with this in mind read reviews online and look for beginner telescopes that have these features and have good ratings 5 x research source choose from 3 types of telescopes while any telescope can facilitate your observation of mars there are three kinds of telescopes on the market to choose from these three types use different optics to enhance distant objects and make them look larger to the eye the options are 6 x research source refractors where you have a lens at the front of the tube these are popular and low maintenance but can be expensive depending on the model reflectors which gather light with a mirror at the back of the tube these are less expensive but require more adjustment when used compound telescopes which use a combination of lenses and mirrors look for a telescope with a higher aperture as a general rule the bigger the telescope the better look for telescopes with a higher aperture which refers to the diameter of its light gathering lens or mirror opt for a telescope with an aperture of 4 inches 10 2 cm or more which can pick up greater detail on a planet or other celestial body 7 x research source purchase color filters if you opt to buy them color filters can add a lot to your experience of viewing mars these filters screw onto the tip of your telescope and work by controlling the type and quantity of light that your eyes receive by either reflecting or transmitting it 8 x research source some specific filters that might enhance your mars observation are 9 x

telescope outdoors for an hour or two before using it to allow the equipment to adjust to the climate the shift from indoor to outdoor temperatures could cause the telescope s optics to fog up affecting the view to make your viewing more efficient later align your finderscope i e the aiming device in your telescope ahead of time focus on a distant object and adjust the settings to fix the view 10 x research source bring a flashlight with you to set up and later pack up your telescope in the dark focus on different elements of the planet a lot of the excitement about viewing mars is due to the notable features of the planet s surface these features are more distinguishable than earth s due to mars smaller size thin atmosphere and lack of erosion 11 x research source some key features that observers look for are 12 x research source mars polar ice caps the pale haze that forms over polar regions albedo markings i e variations of light and dark on the surface of the planet marking an alternation of bedrock and desert sands clouds in the planet s atmosphere sketch what you see sketching mars during your observations is an excellent way of making yourself think about what you are seeing experienced observers spend years sketching the planet to note any intriguing details on its surface or in its orbit be patient in order to capture fine details accurately draw the foremost features first e g the polar ice caps and then add finer details e g clouds haze be sure to note the date time and filters used if any to establish the full context of your observation 13 x research source view mars with your naked eye while using a telescope is the ideal way to view mars in great detail the planet can also be an impressive sight for the naked eye the weeks surrounding mars opposition with the sun and its closest approach to earth are the best times to view the planet without equipment track the dates with a sky map mars should be viewable throughout the evening during this time period 14 x research source use an app like sky map to track where the planet is join an astronomy club if your interest in viewing mars is keen enough consider joining a local astrology club to meet others with the same passion this is a great way to interact with experienced group members who can offer advice about equipment and other important aspects of astronomy group meetings

how to observe the transit of venus,in 2012 an infrequently viewable sight will grace our skies in the form of the transit of venus this means that venus will pass across the face of the sun and we will be able to see venus in silhouette since this won t happen again until 2117 catching it in 2012 is probably a good idea,put the date down in your calendar it will occur on 5 6 june 2012 naturally also hope for cloudless skies and good weather wherever you are also do some research about the transit of venus be in the right location the best viewpoint will be from the pacific ocean 1 x research source the entire transit all four contacts see below is visible from northwestern north america hawaii the western pacific northern asia japan korea eastern china philippines eastern australia and new zealand the sun sets while the transit is still in progress from most of north america the caribbean and northwest south america similarly the transit is already in progress at sunrise for observers in central asia the middle east europe and eastern africa no portion of the transit will be visible from portugal or southern spain western africa and the southeastern two thirds of south america see http eclipse gsfc nasa gov transit venus city12 1 html for the exact timings for your city or area location around the world understand that the principal events occurring during the transit are characterized by contacts the event begins with contact i which is the instant when the planet s disk is externally tangent with the sun the entire disk of the venus is first seen at contact ii when the planet is internally tangent with the sun during the next several hours venus gradually traverses the solar disk at a relative angular rate of approximately 4 arc minutes per hour at contact iii the planet reaches the opposite limb and is once again internally tangent with the sun the transit ends at contact iv when the planet s limb is externally tangent to the sun contacts i and ii define the phase called ingress while contacts iii and iv are known as egress greatest transit is the instant of minimum angular separation between venus and the sun as seen from earth s geocenter take appropriate eye safety precautions to protect your eyes when viewing the transit do not look directly at the sun with the naked eye or unprotected binoculars or telescopes you risk permanently blinding yourself however do not be dissuaded by this proper viewing techniques can permit you to view safely read the nasa guidelines on safe observation of eclipses these can be found at http eclipse gsfc nasa gov sehelp safety2 html the safest observation method involves projecting the sun s image through a telescope binoculars or pinhole onto a screen 2 x research source use a filter approved for safe solar viewing 3 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source approved filters can allow viewing with the naked eye such as an astronomical solar filter that has a vacuum deposited layer of chromium or eclipse viewing glasses like eclipse shades or solar shades or grade 14 or darker welder s glass if wishing to see the transit magnified you ll need to get an appropriate solar filter for your telescope the lens must fit properly and not be makeshift you can also purchase solar binoculars or special telescopes that have in built hydrogen alpha filters if preferred know what to expect using your approved filter or other safe method of viewing you will be able to see a small black dot that is about 1 30th the size of the solar disk it will move across the sun very slowly 4 x trustworthy source nasa independent agency of the u s government in charge of the aerospace research and the space program go to source enjoy the sight given it has a 120 year cycle there will be many people who will never have this opportunity so grasp it while it s there some other things you can do include write a poem story or letter about it to be passed down to your grandchildren some day hold a street party to celebrate the event watch webcasts have a ball,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to photograph fireworks,fireworks look beautiful in photographs full of light and color you may wonder how you can best capture fireworks in an image without issues like over or underexposure blurriness and graininess to photograph fireworks well start by picking a good shooting location you can also use camera settings that will help you achieve a high quality image then set up the camera on a tripod to keep it steady and frame the fireworks with landmarks a skyline or even people to capture interesting photos,look for a high spot in an open area try to position yourself on a spot that is high up such as a ledge in a field or a high slope by a main road check that you can see the spot where the fireworks are supposed to be in the sky from your vantage point and that you are at a 45 degree angle from the ground when you look up 1 x research source keep in mind if you want to include people in some of your shots you may pick a high spot that you can move down from easily so you can be closer to crowds check that the spot is upwind from the fireworks so you get a clear shot shooting downwind from the fireworks can cause smoke to get into your images as the fireworks go off prevent this by making sure your shooting location is upwind from where the fireworks are set to go off 2 x research source to determine the wind conditions check the weather beforehand note if it is going to be a windy night and plan accordingly pick a spot that has a view of the skyline or a landmark for a unique shot you may want to include a beautiful city skyline or a historic landmark in the area where the fireworks are set to go off find a shooting location that allows you to see the skyline clearly below the fireworks or go for a spot where a landmark or building appears in one side of the frame or in the foreground 3 x research source you can always shift your shooting location slightly while the fireworks are going off to get different objects in the foreground as well as no objects at all in the shot try to find a spot where you can move around and play with different compositions switch your camera to manual mode you do not need an expensive camera with a lot of different settings to photograph fireworks well in fact you can use a film camera or a digital camera to get a great image as long as it can be switched to manual mode 4 x research source make sure the focus mode reverts to manual when you switch to manual mode as this will allow you to focus the camera as needed during the fireworks show if you are shooting with the camera on your smartphone download an app that allows you to have a slower shutter speed on the camera such as slow shutter cam some digital cameras will have a fireworks mode on the settings dial or in the menu options on the camera use this mode if available as this allows the camera to adjust the settings for you so you do not need to do it yourself turn off the flash to limit distractions around you switch the flash off as it is not strong enough to illuminate the foreground in the dark it can also distract you when you are taking pictures and bother others around you 5 x research source use a wide or telephoto zoom lens to capture the fireworks look for a telephoto zoom lens that is 70 200mm or 70 300mm as this will allow you to capture the fireworks in full from a distance you can also use a wide lens that is 24 70mm or 24 120mm if you are shooting a bit closer to the fireworks 6 x research source it may be good to have both lenses on hand so you can switch between them to suit your vantage point start with a slow shutter speed of 2 5 4 seconds using a slow shutter speed will allow the camera shutter to stay open long enough to capture the long light trails of the fireworks avoid going lower than 2 5 seconds as a shutter speed that is too low can cause the fireworks to appear blown out or overexposed 7 x research source you may need to play around with the shutter speed as you photograph the fireworks shifting between 2 5 4 seconds try a few different speeds once you set up your camera to vary the types of images you get set the camera to a low iso level and a narrow aperture field start with an iso that is at 100 as this will allow you to use a low shutter speed you can usually leave the iso at 100 as you shoot the aperture or how wide the lens opens should be around f 5 6 f 8 this will keep the aperture just narrow enough to capture the fireworks without letting in too much light 8 x research source you can try playing around with the aperture field as you photograph the fireworks bumping up to f 11 f 16 depending on how bright your images appear arrive early for the fireworks to reserve your shooting spot if you know the fireworks show is going to be popular you may aim to get to the location 30 minutes 1 hour early so you can set up your camera gear and be ready for the show if you are not sure about the details of the location you may visit it a day early to stake out a good location for shooting the fireworks put the camera on a tripod to get a steady image always use a tripod when you are shooting fireworks as this will ensure you get a clear high quality image set up the camera or your smartphone on a tripod in the shooting location make sure the shutter speed iso and aperture have already been set as you do not want to have to touch the camera too much once you start shooting 9 x research source look for a tripod that fits your camera model at your local camera store or online get a remote shutter release to avoid touching the camera the remote shutter release attaches to your camera and is controlled by a small remote you hold in your hand this feature is ideal when you are shooting fireworks as touching your camera while shooting can cause the images to appear blurry or unclear 10 x research source you can buy a remote shutter release at your local camera store or online focus the camera on a distant object near where the fireworks are going off look into the lense and adjust the focus manually so it is on an object that is fairly far away just beside or in front of where the fireworks are going to explode this will then ensure the fireworks appear in focus when they enter the frame 11 x research source you can also try zooming out or in and focusing on the fireworks to get a different perspective your wide or telephoto zoom lense should make doing this fairly easy frame the fireworks with people objects or a landscape use your surroundings to make the photographs more interesting and unique try placing a landmark in one corner of the frame and focusing on it as the fireworks go off you can also focus on the skyline just below the fireworks to get a nice landscape in the foreground 12 x research source including people watching the fireworks can also make the photographs more interesting try shooting at a lower angle to capture people in the foreground or background of the image reduce the shutter speed if the fireworks appear blurry or unclear if you notice your images are coming out blurry or unclear it may be because your shutter speed is not slow enough bump it down 1 2 speeds so the lense stays open longer and you can capture the full effect of the fireworks 13 x research source you may need to also play around with the aperture setting when you reduce the shutter speed to find the right balance use bulb mode to experiment with exposure to do this press the shutter down as the fireworks are launching continue to hold the shutter for several seconds until the burst fades and then slowly let it go this allows you to create a long exposure that will capture the fireworks as it explodes 14 x research source use a remote shutter release to do bulb mode as this will prevent you from touching the camera and causing it to shift or move which can ruin the photograph,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to photograph the moon,photos of the moon are beautiful if done well but it can be very hard to get a picture of the moon that doesn t look blurry once you re aware of what equipment you need when to take the best photos and how to set up your camera you ll be able to get great shots of the moon with a little photo taking know how the moon might just become one of your favorite photo subjects,use a high quality camera a camera phone will not take good pictures of the moon they will turn out blurry and distant it s best to use the highest quality camera you can obtain lens quality is more important than camera quality so many camera models will be suitable once the right lens is applied 1 x research source choose a lens that is 200mm or higher a high mm measurement on a lens means that the lens can zoom in at a greater distance get the highest mm lens you can more than 300mm is the best but you can also take good moon photos with a 200mm lens 2 x research source use a tripod stability is very important when photographing the moon even the slightest jiggle can result in a blurry photo so you will need a tripod pick a tripod with adjustable legs in case of uneven terrain 3 x research source get a shutter release cable touching the camera to take a picture can wobble it and blur your picture a shutter release cable allows you to take the shot without touching the camera again once it s set up if you don t have a cable use the shutter delay set to 3 10 seconds 4 x research source choose your favorite moon phase the moon can be photographed in any phase except the new moon which is not visible to earth the first quarter half and third quarter phases provide high contrast that allows you to see the craters in greater detail while the full moon is a dramatic choice for a skyscraper what phase you choose is up to your personal preference but it s best to have a phase chosen before going out to photograph the moon learn when the moon rises and sets when the moon sets or rises it is closer to the horizon making it appear larger and closer this makes it much easier to photograph check an almanac or a weather app for moon rising and setting times in your area pick a clear night clouds fog and air pollution will blur your photographs check a weather app before leaving for your session and while photographing a clear night with low smog content and no rain is best for moon photography 5 x research source choose a location away from direct light sources the moon appears bright because it reflects the light of the sun and additional light from streetlights homes and cars can make the moon appear duller and blurrier in pictures it is fine if there is light in the distance but be sure that you are not photographing close to another light source 6 x research source set up your camera set up your tripod on stable level ground and adjust the legs to keep your camera level with the horizon make sure your tripod is stable before mounting the camera and lenses remove the lens cap and turn your camera on if you are using a shutter release cable attach it now focus your camera turn off your camera s auto focus feature first auto focus is not ideal for night photography and may not produce the best focus look through the camera view and manually adjust the focus until you can see crisp details of the moon s surface each camera model has a different method for adjusting the focus so be sure to consult your camera s manual beforehand choose a short shutter speed shutter speed is also referred to as exposure time a shorter shutter speed exposes the camera to less light which means that the details of the moon will be sharper and there will not be a halo of light surrounding it use the shortest shutter speed your camera has use a timer or shutter release cable when you take a photograph the pressure of your hand on the camera can destabilize it making your shots blurry a shutter release cable allows you to stand away from the camera while taking the photo if you don t have a cable use the camera s shutter timer take multiple shots once you have your camera set up and focused take a series of shots of the moon this will let you have a selection of photos to choose from try a few different shutter speeds and focuses to make sure you have the best possible shots,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to photograph the night sky,if you have a cell phone in your pocket or have access to a digital single lens reflex dslr you can easily take gorgeous photos of the night sky to improve your astrophotography avoid shooting in the automatic setting if you re using a dslr program a wide aperture keep the shutter open for a long exposure and increase the iso sensitivity if you re using your cell phone download a low lighting app and consider photographing through a telescope once you ve captured your pictures edit them with software until you have the image you want,mount the camera to a tripod and adjust the f stop to f 2 8 or wider attach your dslr to a sturdy tripod so it won t move or shake open the aperture f stop of the camera to at least f 2 8 or wider so you let in a lot of light 1 x research source the aperture refers to the hole through which light enters the camera to let more light into the camera adjust the aperture to a wider f stop like f 2 or f 1 4 consider using a cable release to capture the image especially if you re leaving the shutter open for more than 30 seconds this will reduce the chance that you bump or shake the camera set the iso high check your camera settings to determine its range of light sensitivity by dialing up the iso your camera will pick up more details in the low light of the night sky try photographing with as high of an iso as your camera has such as 1600 or 3200 2 x research source keep in mind that shooting at a higher iso can increase the noise make the photo grainy so you ll have to edit in post production if you re using a film camera you ll need to load it with high iso film turn the white balance to tungsten white because your eyes have a hard time seeing the true color of the night sky it can difficult to set the color for your camera don t leave your white balance setting set to daylight or automatic which will make the night images come out too warm instead set the camera to tungsten white balance to get a more accurate color read 3 x research source to give you even more control over the white balance shoot the images in raw mode instead of jpg choose a manual or slow shutter speed since it s hard to get enough light for nighttime photographs you ll need to leave your shutter open and manually close it or set it for a slow speed keep in mind that slow shutter speeds will blur any action taking place in the picture such as shooting stars 4 x research source the manual shutter speed might be bulb on your camera for example set the shutter speed to 1 30 or 1 15 download a night photography app make space on your phone to download an updated night photography or long exposure app that works with your operating system these photography apps are designed specifically for taking great low light shots try one of these night photography apps 5 x research source nightcap pro for iphone camera fvv 5 of camera fv 5 lite for android slow shutter cam for iphone average camera pro for iphone night camera for android turn off the flash and high dynamic range hdr setting if you leave the flash on the image won t capture the brightness of the stars and you ll only see the black sky it s also important to turn off the hdr because it will actually make the images blurry and dull 6 x research source avoid using the zoom feature on your phone s camera because it will make the image look grainy and out of focus secure your cell phone to a tripod to get high quality photographs of the night sky with your cell phone it s very important to reduce camera shake purchase a small tripod that has bendable legs and a base for attaching your cell phone once you attach the camera bend the legs if necessary so the phone is pointed at the part of the sky you want if you don t have a tripod handy set your phone against any flat surface nearby such as a railing wall or pillar consider attaching your cell phone to a telescope some of the best photographs can be taken by photographing through the eyepiece of a telescope set up a telescope on a a tripod and look through the eyepiece to adjust the magnification once you re looking at the part of the sky you d like to photograph attach your phone so it s over the eyepiece 7 x research source to take the photo just tap the shutter on your camera screen using the telescope will give you magnified and detailed images compose each photograph with an interesting focal point decide if you d like to capture the stars moon or unique clouds in the night sky to photograph the stars try to shoot on a moonless night so they appear brighter for moon photos check the calendar to determine which phase the moon will be in 8 x research source for example if you d like a full moon you only have 1 to 2 nights each month when you shoot the full or almost full moon to photograph stars plan if you d like them to be bright pinpricks of light or if you want a longer exposure that shows star trails adapt to your situation even if you adjust your composition and camera settings you may have to deal with unexpected variables embrace the challenges and find ways to make them work in your photographs try different things since you never know what may work out 9 x research source for example if the sky becomes cloudy or overcast you might be able to photograph the moon surrounded with an unusual haze take lots of photographs using a variety of settings once you ve chosen camera settings for a night sky situation start taking pictures keep making adjustments to the shutter speed or aperture as you shoot to achieve a variety of effects play around with using your camera s timer to reduce the risk of shaky images edit your photos in post processing to get the desired look most photos of the night sky have been heavily edited to get high quality images use your favorite photo editing software to crop the image adjust the balance and play with the contrast 10 x research source for example photos of the night sky often have tiny specks of color or grainy pixels that are a result of shooting in low light most photo editing software has tools to reduce this noise and make your images crisp stack the photos in processing to make the image you want if you re still struggling to show the intensity of a constellation or the trail of a star use editing software to stack several images since you control the layers in the image you can include planets stars clouds or the moon 11 x research source some camera apps may allow you to photograph in a rapid fire mode these images are great for stacking,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make skies beautiful with gimp,do the skies in your photographs look somewhat blah so long as you take your photographs thoughtfully you can make them pop with a few easy tweaks in gimp the renowned open source image editor these tweaks are also a great introduction to some of gimp s more advanced features such as layers layer modes and layer masks,shoot at a slow iso speed if your camera supports changing this for point and shoot cameras this should always be the slowest speed you have if you have a digital slr this is less important but you should still err towards using slower speeds our example used 100 iso on an ancient canon d30 more recent digital slrs will be fine at much faster speeds we ll get to the reason for this in a bit use a graduated neutral density filter when taking your photos consider getting one if you don t have one a graduated neutral density filter blocks out light in part of your photo since skies are typically much brighter than whatever is below them this allows you to get a more consistent exposure across your photo but if you don t have one or you have no way of fitting filters to your camera or lens don t worry about it see the next step underexpose if you re not using a neutral density filter this can be by as much as a stop or two anything that ensures that your sky does not go pure white or largely so the lost detail in dark areas can often be recovered later blown highlights from an overexposed sky can never be the opposite is often true of film cameras even massive overexposure does not result in blown highlights but shadow detail is often impossible to recover this is part of the reason you should shoot at a slow iso recovering shadow detail brings out noise also the technique used here will bring out any noise that is in the sky too if your photo is already noisy as it will be at faster iso speeds then the end result will be ugly create a duplicate layer of your photo open the layers dialog with ctrl l right click on the background layer and go to duplicate or use the button add a layer mask to your duplicated layer right click on the background copy layer and go to add layer mask hit add none of the settings are relevant to you here select your gradient tool press l to select the gradient tool or bring it up from your tool go to the main gimp window and ensure that the foreground

or at some point above the horizon line and hold down your left mouse button drag your mouse pointer to some arbitrary point upwards you will have to experiment with this to see what works better for your photograph release your left mouse button in the layers dialog right click on the background copy layer and go to show layer mask to ensure that you ve done it right do the same again to turn off the display of your layer mask set the layer mode to soft light from the drop down mode list you will notice that the contrast and colour of your sky has improved this is what you want we ll call this the soft light layer from here on duplicate your soft light layer to taste zoom to 100 on your photo view zoom 1 1 then in the layers dialog right click on your soft light layer and go to duplicate layer do this until either you re either happy with it or until you start seeing large blocks of colour when you hit the latter this is sensor or film noise taking its toll merge your layers by right clicking on any layer in the layers dialog and going to merge visible layers hit ok none of the options are relevant here kick up the saturation in the sky a little this is optional use the freeform select tool hit f to loosely select the sky go to select feather use a radius of roughly 1 2 of the height of your photo in pixels go to colors hue saturation and slide the saturation slider over to the right to taste as earlier it might be best to zoom to 100 in order to ensure that you re not bringing out too much noise in the process hit ok when you re happy with it recover the shadow detail from below the horizon you can skip this step if you used a neutral density filter on the sky duplicate the bottom layer and add a layer mask as we did in steps 2 5 except this time you want to do it backwards by drawing the gradient starting at or just above the horizon line and ending at some point just below the horizon line the end result is that the ground will be in the white area of the layer mask and the sky will be in the black area as before you ll have to experiment with this set the layer mode to dodge or screen duplicate it to taste then merge them as before do any other processing that you see fit to do in our example the sky was crudely de noised a little with a selective gaussian blur filters blur selective gaussian blur then the area below the horizon was sharpened filters enhance unsharp mask and finally a single pass of harry phillips tone mapping script was applied admire the finished result or don t go away for a few minutes come back and compare it to your original to see if it really was an improvement chances are good that it was but it doesn t hurt to go back to the start and experiment with different layer masks and so

how to photograph a sunset,everyone has seen them stunning pictures of gleaming sunsets rich with colour and warmth that seems to reach out beyond the boundaries of the photograph whether you re taking an evening stroll across the beach or just sitting in your local park this guide will make these breath taking images possible for everyone,get out there early you never know when the best and most beautiful light is going to happen but it usually happens in a one minute window which can be any time within 15 minutes before and after sunset this plus the half hour window at sunrise is what the folks in hollywood call magic hour consequently you want to be on location at least half an hour before the sun sets to give you time to look around and set up set up your camera alternatively don t and skip the technical trivia below if it bores you some proficiency with these things is useful but not essential more important is being out there at the right time with that said play with exposure compensation the feature of your camera that makes pictures lighter or darker you want to make sure that you don t end up with large parts of your sky blown out to pure white remember on digital cameras you can always recover from all but the most terminal underexposure set your iso to its lowest setting on digital cameras the sky at sunset is still bright enough that you can get away with doing this it ll also give you much more latitude for correcting underexposure as per the above since doing this in post processing inevitably brings out any noise present don t increase it unless you have to set your white balance again this only applies to digital cameras many cameras do a reasonable job of this in auto others don t they may see too much red in your scene and try to balance it out which is not what you want the whole point of being out there is to capture these great colours daylight or shade settings are a good bet but you ll doubtless want to experiment with this every camera is different and some are much smarter than others which brings us around to the last point get to know your camera few cameras will get a perfect exposure all the time and many will require tweaking every time some cameras are smarter about photographing sunsets than others many will require some degree of exposure compensation if you re using center weighted or spot metering you may find it useful to meter on one of the brighter but not the brightest parts of the sky use your auto exposure lock and then recompose get in the right place move around as much as you can and find the perfect angle there are an infinite number of angles locations and compositions you can play with some ideas if you re out of them follow below use reflections off bodies of water if you re near one get down as low to the water as you dare or do the opposite and go to the highest angle you can get at to get an entirely different reflection in the water try making your picture near symmetrical

how to photograph fireworks,fireworks look beautiful in photographs full of light and color you may wonder how you can best capture fireworks in an image without issues like over or underexposure blurriness and graininess to photograph fireworks well start by picking a good shooting location you can also use camera settings that will help you achieve a high quality image then set up the camera on a tripod to keep it steady and frame the fireworks with landmarks a skyline or even people to capture interesting photos,look for a high spot in an open area try to position yourself on a spot that is high up such as a ledge in a field or a high slope by a main road check that you can see the spot where the fireworks are supposed to be in the sky from your vantage point and that you are at a 45 degree angle from the ground when you look up 1 x research source keep in mind if you want to include people in some of your shots you may pick a high spot that you can move down from easily so you can be closer to crowds check that the spot is upwind from the fireworks so you get a clear shot shooting downwind from the fireworks can cause smoke to get into your images as the fireworks go off prevent this by making sure your shooting location is upwind from where the fireworks are set to go off 2 x research source to determine the wind conditions check the weather beforehand note if it is going to be a windy night and plan accordingly pick a spot that has a view of the skyline or a landmark for a unique shot you may want to include a beautiful city skyline or a historic landmark in the area where the fireworks are set to go off find a shooting location that allows you to see the skyline clearly below the fireworks or go for a spot where a landmark or building appears in one side of the frame or in the foreground 3 x research source you can always shift your shooting location slightly while the fireworks are going off to get different objects in the foreground as well as no objects at all in the shot try to find a spot where you can move around and play with different compositions switch your camera to manual mode you do not need an expensive camera with a lot of different settings to photograph fireworks well in fact you can use a film camera or a digital camera to get a great image as long as it can be switched to manual mode 4 x research source make sure the focus mode reverts to manual when you switch to manual mode as this will allow you to focus the camera as needed during the fireworks show if you are shooting with the camera on your smartphone download an app that allows you to have a slower shutter speed on the camera such as slow shutter cam some digital cameras will have a fireworks mode on the settings dial or in the menu options on the camera use this mode if available as this allows the camera to adjust the settings for you so you do not need to do it yourself turn off the flash to limit distractions around you switch the flash off as it is not strong enough to illuminate the foreground in the dark it can also distract you when you are taking pictures and bother others around you 5 x research source use a wide or telephoto zoom lens to capture the fireworks look for a telephoto zoom lens that is 70 200mm or 70 300mm as this will allow you to capture the fireworks in full from a distance you can also use a wide lens that is 24 70mm or 24 120mm if you are shooting a bit closer to the fireworks 6 x research source it may be good to have both lenses on hand so you can switch between them to suit your vantage point start with a slow shutter speed of 2 5 4 seconds using a slow shutter speed will allow the camera shutter to stay open long enough to capture the long light trails of the fireworks avoid going lower than 2 5 seconds as a shutter speed that is too low can cause the fireworks to appear blown out or overexposed 7 x research source you may need to play around with the shutter speed as you photograph the fireworks shifting between 2 5 4 seconds try a few different speeds once you set up your camera to vary the types of images you get set the camera to a low iso level and a narrow aperture field start with an iso that is at 100 as this will allow you to use a low shutter speed you can usually leave the iso at 100 as you shoot the aperture or how wide the lens opens should be around f 5 6 f 8 this will keep the aperture just narrow enough to capture the fireworks without letting in too much light 8 x research source you can try playing around with the aperture field as you photograph the fireworks bumping up to f 11 f 16 depending on how bright your images appear arrive early for the fireworks to reserve your shooting spot if you know the fireworks show is going to be popular you may aim to get to the location 30 minutes 1 hour early so you can set up your camera gear and be ready for the show if you are not sure about the details of the location you may visit it a day early to stake out a good location for shooting the fireworks put the camera on a tripod to get a steady image always use a tripod when you are shooting fireworks as this will ensure you get a clear high quality image set up the camera or your smartphone on a tripod in the shooting location make sure the shutter speed iso and aperture have already been set as you do not want to have to touch the camera too much once you start shooting 9 x research source look for a tripod that fits your camera model at your local camera store or online get a remote shutter release to avoid touching the camera the remote shutter release attaches to your camera and is controlled by a small remote you hold in your hand this feature is ideal when you are shooting fireworks as touching your camera while shooting can cause the images to appear blurry or unclear 10 x research source you can buy a remote shutter release at your local camera store or online focus the camera on a distant object near where the fireworks are going off look into the lense and adjust the focus manually so it is on an object that is fairly far away just beside or in front of where the fireworks are going to explode this will then ensure the fireworks appear in focus when they enter the frame 11 x research source you can also try zooming out or in and focusing on the fireworks to get a different perspective your wide or telephoto zoom lense should make doing this fairly easy frame the fireworks with people objects or a landscape use your surroundings to make the photographs more interesting and unique try placing a landmark in one corner of the frame and focusing on it as the fireworks go off you can also focus on the skyline just below the fireworks to get a nice landscape in the foreground 12 x research source including people watching the fireworks can also make the photographs more interesting try shooting at a lower angle to capture people in the foreground or background of the image reduce the shutter speed if the fireworks appear blurry or unclear if you notice your images are coming out blurry or unclear it may be because your shutter speed is not slow enough bump it down 1 2 speeds so the lense stays open longer and you can capture the full effect of the fireworks 13 x research source you may need to also play around with the aperture setting when you reduce the shutter speed to find the right balance use bulb mode to experiment with exposure to do this press the shutter down as the fireworks are launching continue to hold the shutter for several seconds until the burst fades

how to photograph the moon,photos of the moon are beautiful if done well but it can be very hard to get a picture of the moon that doesn t look blurry once you re aware of what equipment you need when to take the best photos and how to set up your camera you ll be able to get great shots of the moon with a little photo taking know how the moon might just become one of your favorite photo subjects,use a high quality camera a camera phone will not take good pictures of the moon they will turn out blurry and distant it s best to use the highest quality camera you can obtain lens quality is more important than camera quality so many camera models will be suitable once the right lens is applied 1 x research source choose a lens that is 200mm or higher a high mm measurement on a lens means that the lens can zoom in at a greater distance get the highest mm lens you can more than 300mm is the best but you can also take good moon photos with a 200mm lens 2 x research source use a tripod stability is very important when photographing the moon even the slightest jiggle can result in a blurry photo so you will need a tripod pick a tripod with adjustable legs in case of uneven terrain 3 x research source get a shutter release cable touching the camera to take a picture can wobble it and blur your picture a shutter release cable allows you to take the shot without touching the camera again once it s set up if you don t have a cable use the shutter delay set to 3 10 seconds 4 x research source choose your favorite moon phase the moon can be photographed in any phase except the new moon which is not visible to earth the first quarter half and third quarter phases provide high contrast that allows you to see the craters in greater detail while the full moon is a dramatic choice for a skyscraper what phase you choose is up to your personal preference but it s best to have a phase chosen before going out to photograph the moon learn when the moon rises and sets when the moon sets or rises it is closer to the horizon making it appear larger and closer this makes it much easier to photograph check an almanac or a weather app for moon rising and setting times in your area pick a clear night clouds fog and air pollution will blur your photographs check a weather app before leaving for your session and while photographing a clear night with low smog content and no rain is best for moon photography 5 x research source choose a location away from direct light sources the moon appears bright because it reflects the light of the sun and additional light from streetlights homes and cars can make the moon appear duller and blurrier in pictures it is fine if there is light in the distance but be sure that you are not photographing close to another light source 6 x research source set up your camera set up your tripod on stable level ground and adjust the legs to keep your camera level with the horizon make sure your tripod is stable before mounting the camera and lenses remove the lens cap and turn your camera on if you are using a shutter release cable attach it now focus your camera turn off your camera s auto focus feature first auto focus is not ideal for night photography and may not produce the best focus look through the camera view and manually adjust the focus until you can see crisp details of the moon s surface each camera model has a different method for adjusting the focus so be sure to consult your camera s manual beforehand choose a short shutter speed shutter speed is also referred to as exposure time a shorter shutter speed exposes the camera to less light which means that the details of the moon will be sharper and there will not be a halo of light surrounding it use the shortest shutter speed your camera has use a timer or shutter release cable when you take a photograph the pressure of your hand on the camera can destabilize it making your shots blurry a shutter release cable allows you to stand away from the camera while taking the photo if you don t have a cable use the camera s shutter timer take multiple shots once you have your camera set up and focused take a series of shots of the moon this will let you have a selection of photos to choose from try a few different shutter speeds and focuses to make sure you have the best possible shots,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to photograph the night sky,if you have a cell phone in your pocket or have access to a digital single lens reflex dslr you can easily take gorgeous photos of the night sky to improve your astrophotography avoid shooting in the automatic setting if you re using a dslr program a wide aperture keep the shutter open for a long exposure and increase the iso sensitivity if you re using your cell phone download a low lighting app and consider photographing through a telescope once you ve captured your pictures edit them with software until you have the image you want,mount the camera to a tripod and adjust the f stop to f 2 8 or wider attach your dslr to a sturdy tripod so it won t move or shake open the aperture f stop of the camera to at least f 2 8 or wider so you let in a lot of light 1 x research source the aperture refers to the hole through which light enters the camera to let more light into the camera adjust the aperture to a wider f stop like f 2 or f 1 4 consider using a cable release to capture the image especially if you re leaving the shutter open for more than 30 seconds this will reduce the chance that you bump or shake the camera set the iso high check your camera settings to determine its range of light sensitivity by dialing up the iso your camera will pick up more details in the low light of the night sky try photographing with as high of an iso as your camera has such as 1600 or 3200 2 x research source keep in mind that shooting at a higher iso can increase the noise make the photo grainy so you ll have to edit in post production if you re using a film camera you ll need to load it with high iso film turn the white balance to tungsten white because your eyes have a hard time seeing the true color of the night sky it can difficult to set the color for your camera don t leave your white balance setting set to daylight or automatic which will make the night images come out too warm instead set the camera to tungsten white balance to get a more accurate color read 3 x research source to give you even more control over the white balance shoot the images in raw mode instead of jpg choose a manual or slow shutter speed since it s hard to get enough light for nighttime photographs you ll need to leave your shutter open and manually close it or set it for a slow speed keep in mind that slow shutter speeds will blur any action taking place in the picture such as shooting stars 4 x research source the manual shutter speed might be bulb on your camera for example set the shutter speed to 1 30 or 1 15 download a night photography app make space on your phone to download an updated night photography or long exposure app that works with your operating system these photography apps are designed specifically for taking great low light shots try one of these night photography apps 5 x research source nightcap pro for iphone camera fvv 5 of camera fv 5 lite for android slow shutter cam for iphone average camera pro for iphone night camera for android turn off the flash and high dynamic range hdr setting if you leave the flash on the image won t capture the brightness of the stars and you ll only see the black sky it s also important to turn off the hdr because it will actually make the images blurry and dull 6 x research source avoid using the zoom feature on your phone s camera because it will make the image look grainy and out of focus secure your cell phone to a tripod to get high quality photographs of the night sky with your cell phone it s very important to reduce camera shake purchase a small tripod that has bendable legs and a base for attaching your cell phone once you attach the camera bend the legs if necessary so the phone is pointed at the part of the sky you want if you don t have a tripod handy set your phone against any flat surface nearby such as a railing wall or pillar consider attaching your cell phone to a telescope some of the best photographs can be taken by photographing through the eyepiece of a telescope set up a telescope on a a tripod and look through the eyepiece to adjust the magnification once you re looking at the part of the sky you d like to photograph attach your phone so it s over the eyepiece 7 x research source to take the photo just tap the shutter on your camera screen using the telescope will give you magnified and detailed images compose each photograph with an interesting focal point decide if you d like to capture the stars moon or unique clouds in the night sky to photograph the stars try to shoot on a moonless night so they appear brighter for moon photos check the calendar to determine which phase the moon will be in 8 x research source for example if you d like a full moon you only have 1 to 2 nights each month when you shoot the full or almost full moon to photograph stars plan if you d like them to be bright pinpricks of light or if you want a longer exposure that shows star trails adapt to your situation even if you adjust your composition and camera settings you may have to deal with unexpected variables embrace the challenges and find ways to make them work in your photographs try different things since you never know what may work out 9 x research source for example if the sky becomes cloudy or overcast you might be able to photograph the moon surrounded with an unusual haze take lots of photographs using a variety of settings once you ve chosen camera settings for a night sky situation start taking pictures keep making adjustments to the shutter speed or aperture as you shoot to achieve a variety of effects play around with using your camera s timer to reduce the risk of shaky images edit your photos in post processing to get the desired look most photos of the night sky have been heavily edited to get high quality images use your favorite photo editing software to crop the image adjust the balance and play with the contrast 10 x research source for example photos of the night sky often have tiny specks of color or grainy pixels that are a result of shooting in low light most photo editing software has tools to reduce this noise and make your images crisp stack the photos in processing to make the image you want if you re still struggling to show the intensity of a constellation or the trail of a star use editing software to stack several images since you control the layers in the image you can include planets stars clouds or the moon 11 x research source some camera apps may allow you to photograph in a rapid fire mode these images are great for stacking,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to make skies beautiful with gimp,do the skies in your photographs look somewhat blah so long as you take your photographs thoughtfully you can make them pop with a few easy tweaks in gimp the renowned open source image editor these tweaks are also a great introduction to some of gimp s more advanced features such as layers layer modes and layer masks,shoot at a slow iso speed if your camera supports changing this for point and shoot cameras this should always be the slowest speed you have if you have a digital slr this is less important but you should still err towards using slower speeds our example used 100 iso on an ancient canon d30 more recent digital slrs will be fine at much faster speeds we ll get to the reason for this in a bit use a graduated neutral density filter when taking your photos consider getting one if you don t have one a graduated neutral density filter blocks out light in part of your photo since skies are typically much brighter than whatever is below them this allows you to get a more consistent exposure across your photo but if you don t have one or you have no way of fitting filters to your camera or lens don t worry about it see the next step underexpose if you re not using a neutral density filter this can be by as much as a stop or two anything that ensures that your sky does not go pure white or largely so the lost detail in dark areas can often be recovered later blown highlights from an overexposed sky can never be the opposite is often true of film cameras even massive overexposure does not result in blown highlights but shadow detail is often impossible to recover this is part of the reason you should shoot at a slow iso recovering shadow detail brings out noise also the technique used here will bring out any noise that is in the sky too if your photo is already noisy as it will be at faster iso speeds then the end result will be ugly create a duplicate layer of your photo open the layers dialog with ctrl l right click on the background layer and go to duplicate or use the button add a layer mask to your duplicated layer right click on the background copy layer and go to add layer mask hit add none of the settings are relevant to you here select your gradient tool press l to select the gradient tool or bring it up from your tool go to the main gimp window and ensure that the foreground

your photograph release your left mouse button in the layers dialog right click on the background copy layer and go to show layer mask to ensure that you ve done it right do the same again to turn off the display of your layer mask set the layer mode to soft light from the drop down mode list you will notice that the contrast and colour of your sky has improved this is what you want we ll call this the soft light layer from here on duplicate your soft light layer to taste zoom to 100 on your photo view zoom 1 1 then in the layers dialog right click on your soft light layer and go to duplicate layer do this until either you re either happy with it or until you start seeing large blocks of colour when you hit the latter this is sensor or film noise taking its toll merge your layers by right clicking on any layer in the layers dialog and going to merge visible layers hit ok none of the options are relevant here kick up the saturation in the sky a little this is optional use the freeform select tool hit f to loosely select the sky go to select feather use a radius of roughly 1 2 of the height of your photo in pixels go to colors hue saturation and slide the saturation slider over to the right to taste as earlier it might be best to zoom to 100 in order to ensure that you re not bringing out too much noise in the process hit ok when you re happy with it recover the shadow detail from below the horizon you can skip this step if you used a neutral density filter on the sky duplicate the bottom layer and add a layer mask as we did in steps 2 5 except this time you want to do it backwards by drawing the gradient starting at or just above the horizon line and ending at some point just below the horizon line the end result is that the ground will be in the white area of the layer mask and the sky will be in the black area as before you ll have to experiment with this set the layer mode to dodge or screen duplicate it to taste then merge them as before do any other processing that you see fit to do in our example the sky was crudely de noised a little with a selective gaussian blur filters blur selective gaussian blur then the area below the horizon was sharpened filters enhance unsharp mask and finally a single pass of harry phillips tone mapping script was applied admire the finished result or don t go away for a few minutes come back and compare it to your original to see if it really was an improvement chances are good that it was but it doesn t hurt to go back to the start and experiment with different layer masks and so

how to photograph a sunset,everyone has seen them stunning pictures of gleaming sunsets rich with colour and warmth that seems to reach out beyond the boundaries of the photograph whether you re taking an evening stroll across the beach or just sitting in your local park this guide will make these breath taking images possible for everyone,get out there early you never know when the best and most beautiful light is going to happen but it usually happens in a one minute window which can be any time within 15 minutes before and after sunset this plus the half hour window at sunrise is what the folks in hollywood call magic hour consequently you want to be on location at least half an hour before the sun sets to give you time to look around and set up set up your camera alternatively don t and skip the technical trivia below if it bores you some proficiency with these things is useful but not essential more important is being out there at the right time with that said play with exposure compensation the feature of your camera that makes pictures lighter or darker you want to make sure that you don t end up with large parts of your sky blown out to pure white remember on digital cameras you can always recover from all but the most terminal underexposure set your iso to its lowest setting on digital cameras the sky at sunset is still bright enough that you can get away with doing this it ll also give you much more latitude for correcting underexposure as per the above since doing this in post processing inevitably brings out any noise present don t increase it unless you have to set your white balance again this only applies to digital cameras many cameras do a reasonable job of this in auto others don t they may see too much red in your scene and try to balance it out which is not what you want the whole point of being out there is to capture these great colours daylight or shade settings are a good bet but you ll doubtless want to experiment with this every camera is different and some are much smarter than others which brings us around to the last point get to know your camera few cameras will get a perfect exposure all the time and many will require tweaking every time some cameras are smarter about photographing sunsets than others many will require some degree of exposure compensation if you re using center weighted or spot metering you may find it useful to meter on one of the brighter but not the brightest parts of the sky use your auto exposure lock and then recompose get in the right place move around as much as you can and find the perfect angle there are an infinite number of angles locations and compositions you can play with some ideas if you re out of them follow below use reflections off bodies of water if you re near one get down as low to the water as you dare or do the opposite and go to the highest angle you can get at to get an entirely different reflection in the water try making your picture near symmetrical

how to photograph lightning,lightning photography is a difficult process that relies on skill timing and luck it is impossible to know exactly when and where lightning may strike and most people don t have the reflexes necessary to capture a lightning strike as it occurs because of this the best method of photographing lightning is to meticulously set up a camera open its shutter and wait by closing the shutter after the strike has already happened you are much more likely to successfully photograph lightning 1 x research source,pick the right camera purchase or borrow a camera that is good for use in landscape photography the camera must have the capability for manual focus and remote shutter release a digital display is also useful for lining up your shot and for correcting unforeseen image quality issues mid shoot digital single lens reflex dslr cameras are ideal for photographing lightning compact point and shoot cameras often respond too slowly and don t always have the required features if you would like to use a compact camera test it out first 2 x research source attach an optional specialty lens to your camera while not necessary a wide angle zoom lens works best for lightning photography the wide angle will allow you to fit more into the shot maximizing your chances of catching an interesting lightning strike meanwhile a zoom lense will give you the ability of adjusting the focal length to target a specific area this option is especially useful in case the storm shifts position or you decide to focus on an interesting nearby object instead of the horizon 3 x research source find a suitable location not only is trying to take photographs in the middle of a storm dangerous but it is also unlikely to produce quality photos the optimal distance for lightning photographs is somewhere between roughly 6 and 10 miles from the storm any closer is too dangerous any further will likely give you small blurry lightning strikes that look relatively unimpressive figure out which direction the storm is moving it s best to position yourself so that the storm moves across your field of view rather that towards or away from it this will ensure that the storm will remain an optimal distance from you for as long as possible 4 x research source there are a few ways to determine a storm s direction if the storm is moving fast enough you can easily see its pattern of movement and use a compass however if you have access to the internet the most accurate way is to check your local meteorologist for details or use a storm tracking application 5 x research source pick an interesting vantage point the best lightning photographs are usually framed in such a way to include something else that s visually interesting such as a city skyline or a natural monument this gives the viewer a frame of reference for understanding the storm s large size 6 x research source set up some type of camera support for lightning photographs you will be using camera settings that cause the slightest movement to ruin an otherwise great shot don t try to hold your camera in your hands you can use any object that keeps still to mount your camera while a traditional tripod can work great you can place your camera on something as simple as a bean bag chair for greater flexibility 7 x research source no matter what you use for support try to skew your camera s field of view up towards the sky 8 x research source stay safe it is important to have a good view of the storm but don t get too close successive lightning strikes often occur two to three miles apart 9 x research source so keep in mind that you will need to stay a significantly larger distance away even so lightning can also strike far from a storm s center and certain additional precautions should be taken don t use an umbrella when using a tripod you should also use an extra long shutter release cable a metal tripod can act as a lightning rod and you want to be as far away from a potential lightning strike as possible if possible stay inside a building or a car with the windows rolled up stay at least 50 feet away from water and tall structures like trees and buildings 10 x research source set your camera for manual focusing lightning strikes are too fast for your camera s autofocus to follow keeping autofocus turned on will probably give you blurry photos since the autofocus will continuously hunt for an object to focus on between shots many cameras have an external physical switch to change between automatic and manual focus if your camera doesn t try looking through the camera s advanced settings via its digital display 11 x research source switch your camera s focus to infinity you will not have time to focus on an individual lightning strike so it s best to keep your camera focused on a static position infinity focus will keep your camera focused where lightning is likely to strike infinity focus will bring everything past a certain point on the horizon into focus 12 x research source the infinity focus setting is typically indicated by the infinity symbol which looks like a sideways figure 8 when using a detachable lens the infinity focus setting is usually part of its focus ring 13 x research source infinity focus is becoming less common of a feature on newer model cameras many of these cameras have lenses that can focus beyond what was previously termed infinity when photographing lightning with these cameras try shifting the manual focus as far away as possible at first you may need to take a few test shots to find the perfect focus for capturing lightning on film 14 x research source set your camera s iso to a medium one iso is essentially a measurement of how sensitive your camera is to light if you re working under brighter conditions a lower iso is appropriate for darker situations you will need a higher more sensitive iso the exact iso best for your particular situation will vary so it s best to find it through trial and error with a few test shots an iso of around 200 is often recommended as a good place to start for lightning photography most dslr cameras have a physical button for iso settings while compact cameras typically have them under a digital menu the lower the iso or film speed the less noise you will have because of this it s best to use the lowest iso that gives you a clear picture 15 x research source set the shutter speed to b or bulb this setting will allow you to manually control your camera s shutter and consequently its exposure time tripping the shutter on a camera at the exact moment that lightning strikes is nearly impossible to do using the bulb setting keeps the shutter open until you manually close it again if your camera does not let you manually control the shutter set its speed to the longest available which should be between 10 to 30 seconds 16 x research source use a remote control to open the shutter once your setup is perfect you can finally start to photograph lightning start the process by opening the shutter a remote shutter will both keep you out of harm s way and eliminate blurriness caused by manually pressing a button on the camera close the shutter after lightning strikes wait a few seconds for lightning to strike after it does close the shutter using your remote control when fairly close to a storm exposure time should be no longer than 15 seconds for storms that are further away exposure time can be anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes 17 x research source in photography exposure time is the length of time that light is allowed to enter the camera creating an image it s the time period between when you open and close the shutter 18 x research source most lightning photography techniques use long exposure times review your photos and change settings if needed between strikes when it comes to photographing lightning there is no one size fits all list of settings that will get you perfect pictures every time every situation is unique so you will need to use your own judgment because most cameras now have screens that let you immediately see your shots you can check to see if your image quality is acceptable during your shoot if the photographs seem overexposed or too noisy try reducing the iso if the photographs are too dim try increasing the iso if the lightning seems out of focus try adjusting your lens if the lightning isn t sharp and adjusting the focus doesn t help try increasing the shutter speed the less time the shutter is left open the sharper your pictures will be 19 x

how to photograph star trails,the night sky can make a perfect background for amateur and professional photographers while zooming in to take a quick shot of celestial bodies can generate great pictures you can also photograph the stars as they move through the night sky the resulting images are known as star trails and have become quite popular to create a great photo you need to pick a good location compose your shot well choose between short and long exposures and touch up the image with editing software in the end a good picture is well worth the effort,wait for a clear sky you will need a clear view of the sky to take a good star trail photo check the weather forecast for your location ahead of time only go on a clear cloudless night also be sure that there are no other obstructions such as a forest canopy blocking your view of the stars 1 x research source account for moonlight getting away from artificial light is not always enough to eliminate light pollution a bright moon can cast enough light to interfere with you photo and make the stars hard to find plan ahead of time to go out on a night when moonlight is negligible a new moon is the best 2 x research source find a dark location you want to reduce any interference known as noise with your picture this means eliminating as many light sources as possible go away from cities and find a remote location with no artificial lights 3 x research source search for interesting landmarks old buildings or monuments can make an interesting foreground for your star trail photo you can also place natural formations such as mountains trees or caves in the picture having an interesting landmark will give the picture more more substance and make it more captivating 4 x research source place the camera on a sturdy base first and foremost you need a steady camera to take a shot to achieve this attach the camera to a steady tripod base lock the base into place and take care not to hit or bump the base as you move around the site 5 x research source though you can use film digital cameras lend themselves better to photographing star trails with a digital camera you can choose to do one long exposure or overlay several quick pictures and you can see the photo s before leaving the site of the shot compose the shot decide what elements will be in the shot e g stars cabin and truck arrange the elements so that they are balanced in relation to one another you can look through the camera periodically as you compose the shot this will help you see what the shot looks like within the frame of the picture 6 x research source focus your camera if you are using a camera with auto focus allow the camera to focus one time once the camera is focused switch the settings to manual focus this will prevent the camera from attempting to auto focus repeatedly as you go 7 x research source if your camera doesn t auto focus you will have to bring the camera into focus manually by adjusting the focal length of the lens manage the heat warm colors include reds yellows and oranges cool colors include blues greens greys and purples adjusting the heat of a photo will give the picture a tint of warmer or cooler colors adjust the warmth at your discretion 8 x research source install a cable a remote trigger on a cable makes it easier to do both long exposure shots and a series of shots in short succession most cables can be locked so that the trigger stays in place until you release it this saves you from having to keep your finger on the camera the for the duration of the exposure 9 x research source alternatively you could tape down the shutter button add lighting to the foreground if needed if you have interesting foreground elements they may be hard for the camera to pick up in the dark if this is the case shine a light on the foreground elements use as little light as possible to make them look great if you don t have photography lights use a flashlight 10 x research source you can add filters to your light to cast different colored lights onto the foreground choose an exposure method there are two methods for taking photographs of star trails you can take one photo or a series of photos there are pros and cons to each of the following approaches 11 x research source take one long exposure shot in this case you would use a very long exposure time sometimes several hours which would introduce a lot of noise into the picture the upside is that you would have one single picture of star trails throughout the night take a serious of short exposure shots you can take many shots sometimes hundreds over the course of the night and use a program to stack the shots this reduces noise but requires you to combine hundreds of shots to form on picture of star trails select bulb mode bulb mode also known as continuous shooting mode is a setting that allows your camera to continue shooting until you remove your hand from the trigger this is necessary for long exposure pictures or taking large sets of short exposure pictures 12 x research source use a 30 second exposure time when taking a series of images set the iso the iso setting determines how sensitive the camera is to light the suggested iso changes based on whether you are taking a long shot or a series of short shots for a long exposure shot set your iso to around 200 for a series of shots try setting the iso to roughly 800 13 x research source open the aperture fully the aperture allows light to pass into the camera opening and closing it controls the amount of light that passes through when taking a star trail photo you want to open the aperture fully so that the maximum amount of light comes through 14 x research source take the picture once you compose the shot and set up the camera all that is left is to shoot the picture press down the trigger at the end of the cable lock the trigger until the camera has had the desired exposure time or taken the desired number of pictures then release the trigger to stop 15 x research source troubleshoot to eliminate noise if you have a digital camera you can look at the picture before you leave the site if the picture looks blurry or has obvious signs of interference you can retake the shot look around for any light sources or other disturbances that could affect your shot 16 x research source for example you might be using an electronic device that gives off enough light to affect the shot you took download editing software you can download software to edit digital pictures for free there are also paid versions such as adobe photoshop choose the software with the features and price that you want and download it 17 x research source starstax is a commonly used program to edit and combine photos if you are not using a digital camera you will need to develop the film or send it off to be developed 18 x research source import the picture s once you have an editing program ready you ll need to import the pictures connect your camera to the computer via usb cord if your camera uses a portable memory device e g sd card you can remove the device and plug it into your computer select the pictures you want to use from the memory and upload them to the software program polish the photo s to create a final image if you chose to do a series of images the first thing you will need to do is stack them when you tell the program to stack your images it will layer them one on top of the other to form one picture then use the healing brush and other features to remove imperfections in the pictures 19 x research source if you took one long exposure image you do not have to do the stacking step go straight to the other features for example you might adjust the brightness of the picture or use the healing brush to hide an unwanted spot on the picture,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to photograph the sun,taking a clear picture of the sun can be challenging because it s so far away but you can easily photograph it with the right equipment a dslr camera works best during the day while phone cameras can take great photos of sunrise and sunset if you want the sun to look larger in your photograph you can attach a camera to a telescope to zoom in with a little bit of practice you ll be able to take pictures of the sun at any time of day,get a camera lens with a 300 600mm focal length focal length refers to the angle of view and the magnification of your picture pick a lens that has a focal length between 300 600mm so the sun appears the largest in your photograph 1 x research source check local camera shops to see if you can rent a lens instead of buying one make sure to use a lens made for your camera brand lenses for different brands may not fit onto every camera put a solar filter sheet over your camera lens solar filters help protect your camera sensor and reduce the amount of lens flare in your final picture cut the piece of solar filter slightly larger than the diameter of your lens use tape to secure the filter to the end of your camera

how to photograph a lunar eclipse,a lunar eclipse is a beautiful phenomenon that is fun to watch and photograph photos of lunar eclipses can be taken multiple ways with digital or film cameras four major techniques are the wide angle star trail multiple exposure and the telephoto technique each technique involves taking long exposures in order to capture the full eclipse in one photograph grab up your camera choose a location and be sure to be present for the lunar eclipse from beginning to end,choose your camera an expensive professional camera is not needed to use the simplest method the wide angle technique which involves shooting long exposures for one single photo of a small moon in the sky any camera that is capable of long exposure of at least five seconds is okay to use a film camera digital camera or even your smartphone will work 1 x research source make sure the flash is not turned on a flash keeps the exposure time short in this case you don t have to worry about an overexposed photo 2 x research source use a self timer or cable release a cable release allows you to control the shutter without touching the camera a self timer or cable release prevents vibrations that could blur your photo 3 x research source set up a tripod a photo can be taken without a tripod but it is best to use one a sturdy tripod will keep your camera from moving and messing up the photo 4 x research source tripods for smartphones are available propping the camera on a wall fence or rock can act as a makeshift tripod 5 x research source determine the focal length the type of camera you use will determine what setting is needed choose a speed film setting or an iso setting of 400 if you are using a digital camera an exposure range from 5 to 40 seconds is best if you are using a camera with a manual exposure setting a longer setting than that may cause the photo to come out blurry 6 x research source iso international standards organization determines the sensitivity of the sensor in your camera this affects the exposure of your photos 7 x research source pick an interesting foreground a photo of a lunar eclipse using the wide angle technique will make the moon appear pretty small an interesting foreground will fill up the negative space left by the small size of the moon in your photo 8 x research source consider a cityscape the shape of the skyline will provide an interesting foreground for your photo go out into nature a clear sky and natural landscape is a sure way to have an interesting foreground go to the mountains or a forest for a sure way to fill the foreground in your photo take the picture wait for your chosen duration of the lunar eclipse and the duration of exposure time enjoy the lunar eclipse in the meantime use a digital or film camera this technique takes long exposures of one hour or more so that the path of the moon during the lunar eclipse appears like a long light trail make sure your camera has a manual bulb setting a manual bulb setting is needed to lock the shutter open 9 x research source the shutter needs to stay open for a long duration photo so make sure your camera has the ability to take long exposure photos plan the camera placement in relation to the positioning of the moon research the position and duration of the moon ahead of time you will need to line the camera lens up with the path of the eclipse 10 x research source try estimating the moon s direction and elevation one or two night before the eclipse the moon will appear in the same position 50 minutes later each night if the eclipse begins at 10 p m then the moon will be in the same position at 8 20 p m two nights before 11 x research source use a tripod a tripod is necessary tool because this technique captures the path of the moon and the exposures need to be steady to capture that path use a makeshift tripod like a wall if necessary but make sure the camera stays very still 12 x research source be sure the tripod is sturdy and not prone to vibrating from surrounding movement make sure you have a full battery or an empty memory card long exposure photos can drain the battery quickly a fully charged battery will prevent your camera from dying before the photo is completed 13 x research source choose your camera setting pick an iso of 200 or 400 choose an aperture of f stop f 8 or f 11 the photo exposure will be between one and three hours for this technique 14 x research source aperture is the hole in the camera s lens that allows light to pass through 15 x research source the larger the aperture the more light allowed in the lower the aperture the less amount of light allowed in turn autofocus off focus manually this will help the photo to be as steady as possible 16 x research source position the moon in the corner of the frame make sure that the camera s field of vision lines up with the path of the moon 17 x research source the camera s line of vision can be traced by planning the positioning of the moon one or two nights before this should have been planned already so that it won t be a problem to line the camera up with the moon use a cable release the cable release prevents vibrations this is a necessary tool to use for for a photo that relies on a steady camera 18 x research source lock the shutter open with the cable release open and lock the shutter when you are ready for the photo to begin make sure to time this with the beginning of the eclipse 19 x research source decide between a film and digital camera this technique combines the star trail and wide angle technique by capturing multiple individual pictures and combining them into one photo the details for the multiple exposure technique are different depending on what type of camera you use whichever camera you use must have an ability to shoot double or multiple exposure 20 x research source use a tripod a tripod is necessary because multiple exposures are being taken which requires a smooth shot make sure to use a steady tripod or makeshift tripod 21 x research source position the moon to the corner of the camera s field of vision like the star trail technique this technique will capture the path of the moon make sure the camera will capture the full path of the moon during the eclipse 22 x research source calculate the positioning of the moon by determining where the moon is one or two nights before a lunar eclipse that starts at 11 p m will be in the same position at 9 50 p m two nights before capture multiple exposures with a film camera a film camera captures multiple exposures on one frame on film your final photo upon development will have multiple exposures compressed into one picture 23 x research source capture multiple exposures with a digital camera a digital camera captures multiple exposures and saves them as separate image files to complete the photo multiple photographs will have to be layered into one image in photoshop 24 x research source take the first exposure the first exposure needs to be taken when the lunar eclipse begins from there an exposure will need to be taken every five to ten minutes 25 x research source make sure to be consistent with your time intervals so that the eclipse will be documented evenly 26 x research source change the exposure settings throughout the eclipse the moon s brightness will change throughout the lunar eclipse because of this the exposures will need to be changed for the duration of the eclipse 27 x research source an initial iso setting of 400 at f 8 would call for a shutter speed of 1 1000 second at the beginning of the eclipse from there the shutter speed would be 1 500 1 250 1 125 and 1 60 second consult the lunar eclipse exposure guide to determine the setting for your camera http www mreclipse com lephoto image le exposure1w gif use a camera with a long zoom focal length the telephoto technique relies on a long zoom to take a photo with a large appearance of the moon it is best to use a long telephoto lens or telescope a point and shoot camera can be used if the zoom lens is 6x or more 28 x research source a point and shoot camera can be used but it will not fill the frame of the photo like a slr single lens reflex or dslr digital single lens reflex camera 29 x research source a lot of telescopes will allow you to connect a camera with an adapter use a large tripod you will need to use a larger than usual tripod if you re using a telephoto lens or telescope in this case a makeshift tripod probably won t work 30 x research source calculate the focal length depending on the size of the camera lens the focal length determines how large the moon will appear in your photo the moon size will appear larger with a larger lens 31 x research source an slr photo with a 50mm lens produces photo with a moon size of 0 5mm across this is probably too small a 200mm lens will make the moon appear 1 8mm across a 500mm lens produces a moon size of 4 6mm across the lenses cost between 100 to 250 dslr cameras follow almost the same rules about lens size but then lens can be smaller than an slr camera s lens and produce a larger moon size a 750mm lens in a dslr camera will produce the same moon size as a 740mm lens in an slr camera take a bracketed series of exposures bracketing photos means taking two extra photos at different brightness levels for every photo you

how to photograph a solar eclipse,a solar eclipse is a once in a lifetime natural phenomenon if you re a photography enthusiast it s also a chance to capture the sun s shimmering corona on film in order to keep the intense light from damaging your camera equipment however it s important to arm yourself with the right gear and settings first and foremost fit your camera with a protective solar filter to block out the most blinding rays then select a lens with a focal length between 500mm and 1000mm to make sure that the entire eclipse is visible after that it s simply a matter of waiting to snap the perfect shot,choose your viewing tools you don t have to have a fancy pro grade dslr camera to photograph the eclipse an ordinary digital camera or even a smartphone will do the trick though the results won t be as those taken on a more sophisticated device as long as you ve got some means of snapping pictures you can add to the wealth of beautiful eclipse photos that are sure to surface following the event 1 x research source the same basic technological safety precautions will apply no matter what type of camera you re using go someplace where you can view the eclipse before you can document such a rare and wondrous occurrence you have to be in a position see it due to the earth s constant rotation solar eclipses aren t equally visible from all locations conduct some research to find out if the area where you live falls within the path of totality or the vantage point from which the sun is completely covered by the moon 2 x research source the people within the path of totality which typically encompasses an area about 10 000 miles 16 000 km long and only 100 miles 160 km wide will have the best view of the proceedings 3 x research source guaranteeing that you re in a good position to witness the eclipse may require you to do some traveling obtain a pair of certified eclipse glasses it s never safe to look directly at the sun with the naked eye but this is especially true during a prolonged event like a solar eclipse you can usually find the eye protection you need at local hardware store in the weeks leading up to the eclipse just make sure the glasses you pick up bear the iso 12312 2 certification code which confirms that they meet international safety regulations 4 x research source if you re having trouble tracking down eclipse glasses in stores you can always purchase them online only buy from reputable vendors to be sure that you re getting a quality product 5 x research source as long as you re wearing eye protection you ll be able to catch a glimpse without worrying about damaging your vision while some astronomy experts claim that it s okay to remove your glasses during the darkest phase of the eclipse ophthalmologists agree that it s wisest to just keep them on the entire time fit your camera with a protective solar filter like your own eyes your camera s sensor is extremely sensitive to light what solar filters do is cancel out just enough of the most penetrating light to allow the sun to show up on camera most solar filters can simply be slid or screwed into place over the lens once it s in place you ll need to leave it on both leading up to and after totality 6 x research source the brief period of totality is the only time that it s safe to photograph the eclipse without the aid of a filter look for solar filters of the correct size and specifications on websites that specialize in astronomy accessories 7 x research source most newer smartphone and digital camera models will work just fine without a separate solar filter however it s still probably a good idea to use one if you don t want to risk damaging your expensive device 8 x research source stabilize your camera with a tripod you don t want to spend the afternoon lugging around a ton of equipment a tripod or similar base will steady your camera enhancing clarity and detail it will also free you up to do more important things like tinker with key settings and track your focus 9 x research source connect your camera or telescope securely to the tripod to keep it from coming loose or falling off while you re moving it around avoid disturbing the tripod while you re lining up your frame the slightest nudge could cause blurring or throw your shot out of alignment 10 x research source set the camera to manual with the manual setting you ll have complete control over each of the camera s individual functions at all times this will prevent the camera from making adjustments automatically as conditions change which could affect the way your images turn out 11 x research source if you re using a smartphone your options will be somewhat limited all you can really do is be patient and concentrate on getting the lens focused properly before hitting the capture button 12 x research source equip a lens with a long focal length most professionals recommend using an adjustable telephoto lens with a variable depth of focus somewhere in the 500mm 1000mm range will usually provide the most satisfying results large enough to see in clear detail but not zoomed in so far that you crop the outer edges of the corona or miss a stray solar flare 13 x research source with a wide angle lens the sun will appear too far away to make for a striking picture a standard telephoto lens will help enlarge it but there will still be an undesirable amount of blank space within the frame use your own judgment to decide which focal length is best for the image you want to create the most important thing is being able to fit the entire eclipse in the frame select an appropriate aperture setting your camera s aperture setting determines how much light makes it through to the lens since your camera will be pointed directly at the sun for a long period of time it s a good idea to start with the lowest native aperture setting and work your way up incrementally as needed on most higher end models somewhere between f 5 6 and f 8 will be the sweet spot 14 x research source the amount of light is also known as exposure and it can be the difference between a photo that s crisp and clear and one that s washed out or oversaturated you may have less or sometimes no control over the exposure with an inexpensive digital camera adjust the shutter speed to its fastest value shutter speed determines how clearly defined the action in a photograph is since your goal is to capture the eclipse as accurately as possible a high shutter speed is best at 1 4000 or 1 8000 every glowing wisp and dazzling streak of the corona will be plainly visible 15 x research source with a high fast shutter speed the camera s sensor is only exposed to light for a split second effectively freezing an image lower slow shutter speeds let the light linger which can result in a blurry smeared effect 16 x research source it may be necessary to alter your shutter speed to successfully track the moon s progress as the light grows faint practice shooting with the settings you ve worked out you ll be juggling some technical and potentially temperamental settings made even more frustrating by constant changes in lighting and atmospheric conditions make sure you take some time to familiarize yourself with what each feature does before the day of your shoot that way you can be sure that you ll walk away with some dazzling images and not an endless string of washed out black frames carry out a few sessions in a low light setting like a dark room or moonlit night to mimic the conditions of shooting an eclipse as closely as possible perform a dry run of each of the techniques you ll be using during the event including altering your shutter speed cycling between different exposures and removing and replacing the solar filter shoot at many different exposures the trickiest part of shooting a solar eclipse is keeping up with the ever shifting light in the seconds before and after totality bracketing your exposure will maximize your chances of getting true to life light levels one simple way to do this is to increase or decrease your shutter speed the longer the shutter is open the more light the lens will take in and vice versa 17 x research source more sophisticated cameras sometimes have an auto bracketing feature which will allow you to set the shutter speed to predetermined stops or degrees of exposure 18 x research source take some time to figure out your preferred exposure settings a few days before the actual phenomenon by practicing on the unobstructed sun once you ve got them how you want them leave them alone to make sure they stay just as they are turn off the flash if you re shooting with a standard digital camera or phone camera double check that the flash is completely disabled not on auto that way an artificial secondary light source won t interfere with the natural light peeking out from behind the moon the sun itself will provide plenty of illumination even while it s obscured so there s no need to worry about your shot being too dark 19 x research source even the brightest flash will be too weak to compete with the sunlight but it s possible for it to affect the look of your immediate surroundings on film inadvertent flash could spoil the ambient lighting for other photographers nearby 20 x research source remove the solar filter during totality as mentioned the fleeting moments when the moon is hiding the sun are the only time it will be safe to shoot without the protection of your solar filter this is when you ll be rewarded with the most stunning photos remember to keep the entire radius of the eclipse in the frame to include all of the little details and tricks of light be prepared to remove and replace your solar filter quickly so you don t waste a moment totality typically only lasts around a minute shooting totality with the solar filter still in place will just result in a dim unimpressive approximation of the eclipse s true glory 21 x research source don t miss out on viewing the event for yourself while photographing a solar eclipse can be a fun and exciting project nothing compares to seeing it with your own 2 eyes whether you re putting together a spread for a nature magazine or just shooting for your own enjoyment be sure to pause for few moments to take it all in it may be decades before you get another chance 22 x research source get the sun centered in your viewfinder early so you can step away and get a firsthand look don t waste time struggling with an uncooperative camera if you happen to experience technical difficulties

how to make a telescope,telescopes make distant objects appear nearer using a combination of lenses and mirrors if you happen to have no telescopes or binoculars at home and you can make one yourself take note that the images may appear upside down,gather all your materials you ll need a piece of corrugated paper that is about 24 inches in length this is a ridge material easily available from paper stores or craft stores you ll need two magnifying glasses that are not the same size you will also need strong glue scissors and a pencil 1 x research source if the magnifying glasses are the same size the telescope won t work hold one magnifying glass the bigger one between you and the paper the image of the print will look blurry place the second magnifying glass between your eye and the first magnifying glass move the second glass forward or backward until the print comes into sharp focus you will notice that the print appears larger and upside down wrap the paper around one of the magnifying glasses mark the diameter on the paper with the pencil make sure that it is pulled tight measure along the edge of the paper from the first mark you will need to measure about 1 1 2 inches from the mark this will create the extra length to glue around the magnifying glass cut down the marked line on the paper to the other side you should be cutting across the width of it don t cut lengthwise the paper should be about 24 inches in length on one side cut a slot in the cardboard tube near the front opening about an inch 2 5 cm away do not cut all the way through the tube the slot should be able to hold the large magnifying glass cut a second slot in the tube the same distance from the first slot as was written down between the two glasses this is where the second magnifying glass will go you should now have two lengths of corrugated paper one piece should be slightly larger than the other place the two magnifying glasses in their slots big one at front little one at back and tape them in with the duct tape leave about 0 5 1 inch 1 2 cm of tube behind the small magnifying glass and cut off any excess tube remaining glue first length of paper around one of the magnifying glasses you ll need to glue the edges of the paper together as well since you ve left about 1 1 2 inches of paper make the second magnifying glass tube this one will need to be slightly bigger than the first one not too much bigger only so that the first will fit into the second one slot the 1st tube into the 2nd you can now use this telescope for looking at things farther away although it will be difficult to view the stars clearly this type of telescope is really good for viewing the moon the images will be upside down since astronomers don t care about up and down in space there is no up or down in space after all if you wish to align the image with gravity you can use two prisms aligned in an n shape to correct the image but you will have to re position the lenses gather materials you ll need two lenses a mailing tube that has an inside tube and an outside tube you can get this at the post office or office supply store it should have a diameter of 2 inches and a length of 43 3 inches a coping saw a box cutter some strong glue and a drill 2 x research source lenses should be a different focal length for best results get a concave convex lens with a diameter of 49 mm and a focal length of 1 350 mm and a plano concave lens with a diameter of 49 mm and a focal length of 152 mm it s very easy to order lenses off the internet and they aren t very expensive you can get the pair of lenses for about 16 the coping saw is the most effective for making clean straight lines but you can use any other kind of saw or cutting device if you need to cut the outer tube in half you ll need both sections but the inner tube will act to space them out the lenses will go in either section of the outer tube cut 2 pieces from the inner tube of the mailing tube these will be your spacers and they should be about 1 to 1 5 inches in diameter make sure you cut clean and straight with the coping saw or other tool 3 x research source the spacers hold the second lens in place at the end of the outer section of the mailing tube make eye hole in mailing tube cap use the drill to apply light pressure to the middle of the cap to create your eye hole again this will need to be as smooth and as clean as possible to create the best viewing results 4 x research source drill holes on the outside of the large tube you ll need to make the holes where the lens is going to be placed in the outer tube because the holes allow you to put glue into the inner part of the tube near the end of the inner tube is the best place about an inch in you ll also need to the make holes at the end of the outer tube for the eyepiece and the cap glue eyepiece lens against removable cap the eyepiece lens is the plano concave lens and the flat side needs to be against the cap you ll glue through the holes you made and turn the lens to spread the glue press tube against lens until the glue is dry cut off closed end of outer tube you ll end up sticking the inner tube into the outer tube through this hole 5 x research source insert first spacer into outer tube the spacer will need to lie flat on the inside of the outer tube to hold the concave convex lens in place you ll need to drill the holes and put the glue in like you did with the eyepiece insert lens and second spacer you ll need to make the holes put the glue in and spread it around press firmly until the glue has dried insert inner tube into outer tube you can slide the pieces as necessary to get the right focus since this is about 9x you should be able to see the moon s surface really well and even saturn s rings anything else will be too far away for your telescope enjoy the finished telescope the project is finished and you should now be able to use your telescope to gaze at the night

how to use a telescope,telescopes gather light and make for the most spectacular viewing experiences the thrill of viewing distant galaxies brilliant star clusters unique nebulae solar system planets and lunar features is nearly indescribable,consider the type of telescope different telescopes are better for different types of viewing there are really on three basic telescope types refractor reflector and catadioptric which one you choose will be based on what you want to observe where you are and so on 1 x research source the refractor basically has a long thin tube with an objective lens at the front that collects and focuses the light this one is better for viewing the moon and planets usually giving a nice crisp image it travels well and doesn t need much maintenance unfortunately it is very hard to see faint objects like galaxies and nebulae the reflector employs a large concave mirror rather than a lens for the purposes of accumulating and focusing light this is one of the better beginner telescopes and it usually has pretty good visibility although water has a tendency to condense on the optics of the telescope which can be irritating also you can t view terrestrial objects with this telescope the catadioptric is a compound telescope combining both lenses and mirrors they are good photographic telescopes and they are a lot easier to carry than the reflector this one tends to be more versatile but they do tend to be more expensive than the other types consider where you live you ll need different power levels considering where you are if you have an area where the light pollution is better or worse if you are in an area where it rains more etc 2 x research source if you want to bird watch for example with your telescope you ll be better off not choosing the reflector telescope because it won t show you terrestrial objects if you re in a place where it dews frequently and you re planning on using your telescope at night you ll need to consider whether choosing a refractor or catadioptric telescope might be your best option consider what you want to look at objects like the planets the moon and closer stars need a high power good contrast and sharp resolution in a telescope so if this is what you want to look at your best bet is to go with a refractor or a reflector if you re looking at faint objects such as galaxies and nebulae you ll need a bigger aperture and choose a big reflector telescope consider the power capabilities of your telescope people generally have the mistaken impression that more power automatically means higher resolution and better viewing but this is not actually true high power simply dilutes the brightness of the image and amplifies any blurriness 3 x research source for any telescope the maximum amount of magnification equals 50 power per inch of aperture so say you have a 6 inch reflector 300 power is as high as you should go for a 3 inch reflector it would be about 150 power even if you re using a barlow lens magnifying it too far will only result in a blurred image the telescope s image can only be blown up to a certain point learn the finderscope this is typically attached the side of the telescope it displays more of the sky than the scope itself for instance a 50 power telescope covers an area about as small as the fingernail on your little finger whereas an 8x finderscope covers an area about the size of a golf ball learn the mount telescopes typically come in two types equatorial or altazimuth you ll need to know which kind of telescope you have so you can learn how to operate your telescope 4 x research source altazimuth mount operates my going up and down and side to side making it easier for beginners to operate it is more simple than the equatorial telescope equatorial mount swings across the celestial north to south and east to west the polar axis which is the rotating part closer to the telescope s base needs to be aligned to polaris the north star it will then follow the motion of the sky around this point moving from east to the west as the stars move it takes more time to get accustomed to the equatorial mount each time you want to look at a different star or planet you have to unlock the axis and take aim at the heavenly body using the finderscope and lock it once you have the general location from there you ll use the slow motion cable controls or panhandle controls to make the smaller movements the equatorial mount is generally considered to be more helpful learn the tripod you ll need to make sure that the three legs of your telescope are properly balanced otherwise the telescope can fall over and become damaged when you re scouting out locations always look for areas that have a flat level area for your telescope learn the sky before you start tromping around in the dark with your expensive telescope you ll need to figure out what you re looking for maybe you want to have a gander at the moon or want to check out the planets maybe you re interested in a meteor shower you ll need to find out timing place weather etc 5 x research source if you re trying to observe the stars for instance going out on a moon lit night won t get you very far look at books on stars and constellations these will tell you when the best viewing times are and when the planets are easiest to be seen examine sky charts so that when you are out in the dark you know where to point your telescope train your eye to do so make sketches of the moon and the planets you don t have to be a great artist to capture them as accurately as possible this will help you to look more closely at the sky and observe details choose your spot you ll need to choose your spot carefully once you ve decided what you re looking for and where it will be it will need to be accessible at night and have a place with solid level ground for your telescope s tripod 6 x research source you ll need to consider light pollution for instance if you re in a big city going up on a high roof as long as it is safe can get you away from the worst of the light pollution and allow you to see more clearly try to avoid decks and blacktop driveways and concrete footsteps on a deck can cause vibrations in the image blacktops driveways and concrete can create thermal issues for your telescope practice you ll need to practice setting up your telescope and pointing to the correct part of the sky before you start fiddling around at night otherwise it is very easy to lose bits of your telescope and forget how to do something for practice set up your telescope and using the lowest power eyepiece point the main scope at something about 100 feet 30 5 m away like a tree not the sun center the object in your crosshairs and make sure it s clear switch to a higher powered eyepiece and try again be comfortable make sure that when you re having your big night out with the stars that you have dressed appropriately if it is going to be cold make sure you have the right clothes on and bring along a canister of something warm,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to focus on a planet with a telescope,if you have an interest in astronomy knowing how to use a telescope would be a great way to learn more about the night sky using a few simple tricks and aligning your finder with the telescope will allow you to find any visible planet in the night sky take a closer look at those stars and planets above you with this quick guide about focusing your telescope on planets,locate the finder on your telescope the finder is usually a smaller tube that sticks off the side of the telescope it has a wider viewing range so it can be used to find small objects in the sky it only works if it is properly aligned to the telescope itself when you look through the finder you should see crosshairs after properly aligning the finder you can center an object in these crosshairs and then look at it magnified in your telescope adjust the telescope eyepiece to the lowest magnification the lowest magnification on the telescope has the widest range of view when looking through the eyepiece on a smaller scope the eyepiece will have a number written in millimeters such as 20 mm or 25 mm the higher numbers have the lowest magnification look at the eyepieces on your telescope and make sure the one with the lowest magnification is in place for viewing focus the telescope on an object in the near distance it is easiest to do this process during the day when you can more easily see many different objects in the distance but it does not have to be day time choose a distant object such as your neighbor s chimney or cell phone tower and find it in your telescope if your telescope can lock in place engage these locks to keep it from moving away from object you have found adjust the finder to center the large object in the crosshairs now that the telescope is focused on something you want to move the finder until you see the exact same object centered in the crosshairs most finders will have screws on the side that will allow you to adjust its position once you have adjusted the finder look back through it and make sure you still see the object centered in the crosshairs then look through telescope and make sure it is still pointed at the object if both views are of the object you have successfully aligned your finder the finder is easily jostled out of place so you may need to repeat this process again if the telescope is moved or bumped look up star charts and planet guides for that month different planets are more or less visible depending on what time of year it is and where you are in the world there are many websites and guides that will tell you what is visible for the month and location you are in use this as a guide to choose what you want to find 1 x research source 2 x research source these guides will give you an idea of where to look in the sky to find the planet by eye adjust the telescope to its lowest magnification just as you did to align the finder make sure the eyepiece with the lowest magnification is in place magnification on telescopes is measured in millimeters and the lowest will likely be around 20 25 mm you want to adjust the magnification before you locate the planet in your finder because you could jostle the telescope out of position when making the change locate the planet in the telescope finder once you have found your planet of interest by eye position the telescope so that it is pointing in that general direction look through the finder until you find the planet and center it in the crosshairs avoid jostling the finder out of place as you try to find your object move the telescope to adjust the finder s position otherwise the finder position will no longer match up with the telescope find the planet through the telescope s eyepiece if the finder has been properly aligned with the telescope you should be able to see the planet through the telescope eyepiece you might need to move the telescope a little bit to see the planet but it should be pretty close to where you focused with the finder if you get too far away and still can t find the planet through the telescope make sure the planet is still visible in the finder if it is and you can t find it in the telescope try realigning your finder sharpen the planet using the focus knobs using the knobs on the side you can shorten or lengthen the distance between the eyepiece and lens of the telescope changing this distance allows you to focus on the object in question adjust the knobs until you see the image come into a sharp focus try changing the eyepiece to increase the magnification and refocus you may find that while the image is larger you cannot focus as well for smaller home scopes the more you increase the magnification the lower your resolution of image will be smaller scopes just aren t powerful enough to sharpen the focus of a highly magnified planet,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to build an equatorial wedge for your telescope,astronomy is a very popular hobby humans have been interested in the things they can see in the sky since before recorded history and that interest shows no sign of abating there are many brands and types of telescopes out there the vast majority of affordable amateur telescopes that you can purchase come with what are known as alt azimuth mounts this means that the telescope s ota optical tube assembly can be pivoted up and down altitude and right or left azimuth these are fine for visual observation and short exposure photography but if you want to try your hand at astrophotography you will need to mount your telescope on an equatorial eq mount that allows you to align your telescope with the latitude at your location upgrading your alt az mount to equatorial can be expensive though commercial eq wedges will run you anywhere from 200 up equatorial mounts can also be expensive particularly if they are computerized for go to capability used ones can be obtained for less but why buy one when you can build your own and learn something new in the process this article will walk you through the construction of a simple fixed elevation equatorial wedge most amateur astronomers observe the sky from the same place every night so a fixed angle wedge is all that is needed this one however can easily be modified to allow adjustment if you so desire the images depict a wedge for a celestron nexstar 6se 6 schmidt cassegrain telescope but with a little ingenuity and some elbow grease the concepts can be applied to any telescope mount,identify the latitude for your chosen viewing location for amateur purposes you only need to narrow it down to an accuracy of one tenth of a degree rounded up to the nearest tenth for example downtown boston is located at 42 3 degrees north latitude write this down you will need it later on there are several ways you can obtain the coordinates for the location with any gps that can display your position on a garmin device for example the where am i screen will show your current coordinates any smartphone app such as gps status that can do the same using the internal gps with google earth with google maps measure the base of your telescope mount you will need to measure the length and width of the mount assuming that you already made sure your plank of wood is at least four inches wider than the mount add four inches to the length of the mount at the base from the edge of the plank measure the distance to match the number of inches or mm calculated in step 2 draw a line with the pencil across from edge to edge from that line measure twice the distance and draw a second line halfway between draw a third line the first measurement will give you the wood for the base mount the second for the longer plank that will bolt to the top of the telescope tripod in the end you should have three lines all the same distance from each other cut the plank you will first cut one smaller piece for the telescope mount and a second piece twice as long for the tripod base that piece will have the line you drew right across the middle mark the centers on the smaller piece mark the center by drawing two lines diagonally from the corners on the larger piece do the same but from the edge to the line drawn halfway down its length measure and mark the bolt holes this part is tricky you will need to measure the distance from the center of the telescope mount to the center of the bolt holes as well as the angles in order to mark and drill the holes you ll need to do the same for the bolt holes on the top of the tripod but keep in mind that the bolt hole layout may be different so don t assume they are the same drill the bolt holes you may have to adjust a bit and make the holes oversize to get them to fit properly that s ok as long as you use washers the boards will not move on the tripod on the smaller board use a jigsaw or small saw to cut from the edge of the board to the bolt hole whose radius is perpendicular to the edge as shown in this image the cuts should create a slot whose sides align with the edges of the drilled hole this will make it easier to mount the telescope base to the wedge install the hinge if you have not done so already cut the piano hinge to the width of the board for the telescope mount carefully align the hinge on the line you drew halfway down the length clamp it down and install one side of it using two wood screws on each end you can then remove the clamp place the telescope mount board next to the hinge with the slot cut away from the hinge hold it as close to the hinge as possible and screw it to the side edge of the board the hinge should touch the base and the telescope mount board should hinge up as shown in the image bolt the wedge to the top of the telescope mount making sure you use washers on each bolt decide how you will support the telescope mount base at this point you can do one of two things you can cut triangular pieces of wood to insert underneath the telescope mount board and hold it at a fixed angle or you can cut larger pieces to attach on the outside of the long base board to support the telescope mount but also give you the ability to modify the angle if needed the tricky part here is the geometry the top surface of the telescope base mount must be raised to an angle equal to the latitude of your location you did write that down in step 1 right that angle needs to be as accurate as possible but for amateur purposes the tolerances need not be microscopic build the supports in my case i used two pieces of wood cut them roughly to the shape of a slice of pizza with the radius about an inch longer than 1 2 the length of the telescope base mount board and attached it to the outside of the wedge with screws you can and probably should use a wood router to make dado cuts and apply glue i used wood screws raise the board to the desired angle remember to measure the angle of the top surface of the board triple check the angle secure the board and drill holes on each side slightly smaller than the wood screws and into the edge of the board insert screws at this point you should have a working wedge all you need is a clear night and an understanding of how to polar align the telescope the shelf under the telescope mount board can be used to store eyepieces or a larger battery to power the scope s electronics sand everything down to remove any splinters and sharp edges and finish to your preference you now have a platform for astrophotography

how to choose the right telescope,ever been interested in space and the night sky well these steps will start you off on a great adventure,the diameter of the objective lens or mirror is the most important number describing a telescope larger diameter lenses or mirrors allow higher resolution ability to separate closely spaced objects and will gather more light from faint astronomical objects they also cost more a good size for a first telescope is roughly four inches 100mm bigger tends to be considerably more expensive and more inconvenient bigger works better of course though not shockingly so magnification is relatively unimportant and is often hyped in advertising claims for inexpensive telescopes in astronomy the purpose of a telescope is mostly to collect light from faint objects not to magnify them most visual observing is done between 50 and 200 power too much magnification just gives you a useless blur a good rule of thumb to determine the maximum usable magnification is to multiply the diameter of the objective in millimeters by 2 5 which means that the typical department store 60mm scope is only usable to 150x in actual practice on nights of extremely unusual atmospheric stability you may be able to use a somewhat higher power but don t count on it the better eyepieces have larger eye relief which represents how close you have to get your eye to the eyepiece to observer clearly if the eye relief is too small you will have to bring your eye very close to the eyepiece and it will be all but impossible to observe for more than a few seconds at a time look for a steady mounting an unstable or shaky mounting will ruin your observing experience in general the more massive the mount looks the better it performs when in doubt spend more on a mount join an astronomy club and learn to use someone else s telescope before buying your own start with a pair of binoculars and learn to find things in the sky before buying a telescope or if you just want to see pretty objects get a goto mount don t expect a small telescope to show the same images that you see in astronomy textbooks which are usually long time exposures and may have been taken by much larger professional grade telescopes no telescope practical for most individuals to own will show significant color in nebulae to the naked eye although bigger ones will show shape well and many can reveal color through time exposure photographs,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to spot valuable paintings,art collecting is an expensive hobby but some eagle eyed aficionados can score valuable masterpieces at bargain bin prices whether you re hunting for deals at a thrift shop or evaluating a piece at an art show knowing how to determine a painting s authenticity and worth will help you spot great deals in a sea of knock offs and reprints,seek out paintings created by renowned artists for many people the goal of art hunting is to find a lost masterpiece from a beloved artist though you most likely won t find anything by monet or vermeer you may come across a hidden gem made by a lesser known or regionally popular painter 1 x research source some artists whose work ended up at thrift stores include ben nicholson ilya bolotowsky giovanni battista torriglia alexander calder and even pablo picasso so you ll know what paintings to keep an eye out for learn about different artists through local galleries art museums and online databases like the web gallery of art search for paintings on your phone to see if anything comes up if you stumble upon a piece you think may be valuable try searching for it on google or a similar search engine if the painting shows up in your search results you may have found a valuable item 2 x research source if you don t know the name of a painting search for it using descriptors for example you can find thomas gainsborough s the blue boy with the terms painting kid and blue if you can take a high quality photo of the piece try running it through google s reverse image search at https reverse photos this will make the searching process far easier purchase limited edition and signed prints though most art prints have little to no financial value there are a couple of notable exceptions look out for prints that were part of a limited edition run meaning the artist only produced a few copies and prints with a handwritten signature from the artist on the front or back 3 x research source most limited edition prints have numbers on them indicating which copy you have and how many copies exist avoid buying small and subtle paintings if you plan on selling them unless you stumble upon an original piece by a popular artist stay away from paintings that are extremely small in size or subtle to the point of being abstract though these paintings may be excellent they don t have the same mass appeal that a large traditional painting does making them harder to sell this is especially important if you plan to sell your paintings online since small and abstract art is hard to convey over digitized photographs pick up paintings with high quality frames even if you decide that a painting is not valuable make sure to examine the frame before moving on picture frames are works of art in their own right so a vintage or well crafted frame may be worth a lot regardless of the painting inside look for frames with 4 x research source hand carved designs intricate or unique patterns gilded molding slight wear and similar signs of age look for the artist s original signature often the easiest way to tell if a painting is authentic or not is to look for the artist s signature on the front or back side in particular look for a signature that was hand written or added to the piece using paint if a painting doesn t have a signature or if the signature seems flat and artificial there s a good chance the piece is a reproduction print or fake 5 x research source if you know the artist s name look them up online and see if their signature matches the version on the painting signatures are easy to fake so don t use this as your only proof of authenticity use a magnifying glass to check for printer dots before purchasing a painting hold a magnifying glass up to it and look for small perfectly round dots arranged in a grid if you see any the piece is a reproduction print created using a laser printer 6 x research source though this method will help you identify common prints be aware that it may not work for higher quality giclee reproductions unlike laser prints paintings made using a pointillist technique will have dots of varying sizes and shapes inspect oil paintings to see if they have textured surfaces when determining the authenticity of an oil painting check to see if the surface has bumps or paint waves on it if your piece has a significant amount of texture there s a good chance it is authentic if the surface is completely flat you re looking at a reproduction 7 x research source if a painting only has 1 or 2 spots of texture it may be a forgery disguising itself as the real deal examine watercolor art pieces to see if they have rough surfaces to determine whether or not a watercolor painting is authentic hold the piece at an angle and look at the paint strokes closely if the paper appears rough around major strokes you may have an original work of art if the paper is uniformly smooth it s most likely a reproduction 8 x research source look to see if canvas paintings have rough edges a lot of the time artists who work on canvas will make jagged or uneven brush strokes along the edges of their paintings however they often don t bother retouching these spots since viewers rarely look at them as such if a canvas painting has perfectly even edges there s a good chance it s a factory reproduction 9 x research source check the back of the frame for signs of age often the back of a frame will tell you more about a painting than the artwork itself look for frames that are dark in color and have clear signs of age such as peeling lacquer and patches of worn out wood the older a frame is the more likely the piece inside is authentic 10 x research source if the back of a frame is mostly dark but has a few bright streaks in it there s a good chance the painting is authentic but had to be relined at some point many old frames have a x or h shape in the back something far less common in contemporary frames look at the artwork s mounting method to see how old it is if nails hold the painting in place or if you see empty nail holes around the frame there s a good chance the artwork is an original piece from before the 1940s if staples hold the painting in place there s a greater chance it is a reproduction especially if it is an old piece and has no signs of a prior mounting method,Hobbies-and-Crafts

was known for china with soft floral displays and wedgwood which themed china patterns off portraits or classical greek scenes 2 x research source look for consistency and evaluate quality in sets a complete set is often worth more than a single piece however different pieces that have similar patterns can often be mistaken as part of a set most sets are usually consistent throughout including similar borders corner work shape and pattern while checking for consistency you ll have a perfect chance to scope out the quality as well an ideal set will be consistent in both pattern and color the glaze and construction are also a good way of determining quality glaze should not be bubbled or cracked and the pieces should be completely level so that they don t wobble when laid on the table 3 x research source look for a back stamp or marker stamp this is the easiest way to identify the manufacturer of your dinnerware although in many cases the stamps may have faded or become illegible 4 x

class or date of the piece a good way of finding the approximate value of your piece is to search for an identical or nearly identical piece on an online auction to see its going value however this approximation may vary greatly from that of a professional appraiser if you find that your dinnerware is valuable you might want to take it to a professional appraiser so you can determine the precise value if the stamp on the back of your dinnerware is illegible you can compare its markings with more visible ones on similar dinnerware in an antique catalog at your local library or an electronic directory online use historical trends to your advantage certain designs were more popular than others historically for example dinnerware from 1900 1920 frequently had floral patterns featuring violets pastel colors and were rimmed with a shaped edge other trends that might help you identify antique dinnerware include designs from 1920 1940 which often featured bright colors and geometric shapes pastel colors were still somewhat popular at this time as well as ivory or cream white pieces with gold or silver gilding designs from 1940 1950 which leaned more heavily on bold colors like red blue and green pastels were rare during this period the shape most popular in this era was rimless and streamlined designs from 1950 1970 rarely had gold trim as the recent invention of the microwave made this impractical pastels returned to popularity but were more muted than the dinnerware of the past 5 x research source get your bearings with a brief internet search there are many

likely be able to find books about those particular manufacturers establish a likely period in which your dinnerware was produced sometimes a piece of dinnerware can appear as though it fits in a few different periods but once you narrow down your choices to a likely few you can compare your piece to others in that period if you notice many similarities chances are good the piece was produced in that period in some cases the back marker stamp on the bottom of your dinnerware may give you the exact date of its production this can help significantly with your research 7 x research source maintain the original condition of unappraised items if you see a small crack or some other kind of deformity in your dinnerware you might be tempted to do a quick fix repair or touch up however altering the original condition of your dinnerware could actually decrease its value 8 x research source even if the change you intend on making would normally be considered an improvement this can

proof usually takes the form of a written report the contents of this report normally include the reason for the appraisal the techniques used to value your dinnerware a description of the dinnerware and a precise value of your dinnerware s worth 10 x research source reappraise your items the value of your dinnerware will change as time passes so old appraisals may be significantly different from

how to display antiques,antiques can add class and charm to your home décor but a good display needs to have aesthetic appeal while also keeping the collection safe from potential damage consider location theme and arrangement when determining the best way to display your antiques,consider the context every antique once served a practical purpose think about what purpose that antique once served and choose a room in your house in which it would naturally belong based on that analysis for instance a display of antique dishes and silverware would seem perfectly natural in a dining room but may appear misplaced in a spare bedroom an antique quilt on the other hand would fit in with the décor of a bedroom or family room but might look odd in a dining room or kitchen look for vertical and horizontal space the eye typically looks for blank wall space in square like dimensions but oftentimes there are large patches of empty space that run in either a predominantly vertical or predominantly horizontal direction this primarily applies to antiques you ll hang on the wall like platters and pictures many homes have sections of unused vertical wall space along stairways and near doorways that you can liven up with the right antique display keep fragile items safe antiques that can easily be damaged when knocked or handled should be kept in a protected area but there are still ways to protect these collections while also keeping them on display curio cabinets and similar glass display cases are probably the safest and most traditional option tabletop terrarium boxes and heavy fish tanks are less conventional but equally safe they also allow you to take advantage of spare space on a desk shelf or table a high shelf can work well enough for moderately fragile items that you want to keep away from kids and pets especially if these shelves are kept in an area that sees very little foot traffic place sturdy items out sturdier antiques that can withstand the occasional bump or tumble can be kept out in more visible areas but it can still be a good idea to avoid placing them in high traffic spots of the house antique books suitcases candelabras and durable statues are a few examples of objects that can usually be kept out of protected areas end tables placed in guest bedrooms or coffee tables placed in secondary dens are usually fairly safe options to consider shelves can also work well as long as you can keep kids and pets away keep away from direct sunlight many antiques can fade dry or otherwise take on damage when placed in direct sunlight for extended periods ideally you should display your antiques in an area with relatively low amounts of light 1 x research source this is especially important when dealing with antiques that have been dyed painted or otherwise colored examples of such objects include antique quilts photographs prints paintings and painted statues or pottery the colors of these objects will fade when exposed to bright light group similar items together if you have multiple antique collections consider arranging them in separate areas based on nature and original use the items in any one area do not need to be the exact same but they should be related to one another for example various antique teacups can be arranged in one area even if the individual teacups differ in design you can also display the teacups with other dishes since the original function of both collections are similar enough to work well together a collection of antique teacups would work less well with something completely unrelated though like antique sewing supplies books or tools weave a story some antiques may not be directly related to one another but if you arrange them carefully you can tell a story that links them together this can require a lot of creativity but the end result may leave a stronger impact than a more conventional display would for example antique toys and antique clothing may not have a direct connection with one another but if the toys and clothes are from the same era you can paint a picture of life from that era that picture can be further enhanced by including other antiques of the same era in your display including dishes jewelry tools or figurines coordinate by color group like colors or coordinating colors together to avoid displays that clash keep the color of the room in mind when choosing where to place the antique collection as well a strong visual impact can be created when you display a large group of antiques in a single hue even if the exact shades vary the objects in your display do not need to match but the colors should at least work well together for instance if the majority of your antiques have warm hues reds browns oranges yellows a single blue piece placed among the rest may look out of place stack sturdy items together heavy sturdy antiques can often be stacked on top of one another to save space and create some visual interest never place any item that could break beneath something heavier though a few examples of antiques that can typically be stacked include suitcases trunks and books as a general rule the heaviest objects should be placed on the bottom and the lightest should be placed on top frame conventionally or creatively antique paintings prints and photographs will need to be framed but you have both convention and unconventional framing options to consider additionally there are other small objects you may wish to frame that would not usually be framed look at both vintage and modern frames when displaying antique pictures the best styles will vary on a case by case basis small antique pictures can also be placed in vintage glassware or beneath a heavy sheet of glass set over a modern coffee table vintage buttons and small pieces of jewelry can be framed over sample paint cards or similarly colorful backings 2 x research source vintage playing cards can be framed behind any glass surface antique cookie cutters pins or similar items can be framed in three dimensional shadow boxes 3 x research source avoid clutter you can arrange antiques in clusters and groups but avoid cramming too many objects into one space clutter generally looks bad even when it s neatly arranged you should be able to spot each individual piece when the entire collection is viewed from the front in addition to looking bad clutter can also cause damage since it increases the risk of objects banging or wearing together reflect light since most antiques will need to be displayed out of direct sunlight the display area may look a little dark a safe way to bring more light into the space would be to position surfaces that reflect light behind and around the display mirrors are the most common way to draw and reflect light antiques displayed on a shelf or in a cabinet can be placed directly on top of a large flat mirror or you can position one or more mirrors directly behind the objects on display metal platters and trays are a less conventional option but when polished well enough they can reflect light just as well as mirrors would this can be an especially great option to consider if you have antique platters mixed into a collection of other antique dishes mix in modern items your antique display does not need to consist entirely of antiques when appropriate weave in a few modern day items that work well in terms of theme design and color the juxtaposition between old and new can create greater aesthetic appeal the modern items may serve as nothing more than a backdrop for your antiques for instance you could use new fabric to create a background for antiques displayed on a shelf inside a frame or inside a shadow box on the other hand the modern items can be decorations that share the spotlight with your antiques in this case it s usually best to keep the antique items and modern items clustered separately within the same space for example for a display that combines vintage baseball cards with newer baseball cards the vintage cards can be clustered together just above or beside the cluster of new cards but both sets can share the same wall or shelf space avoid stressing the item try not to display any antique in a manner that stresses the material it s made from if you notice some wear and tear on an item you ve had on display for a while change the display or put the item in storage for example you should avoid hanging or draping an antique quilt the weight of the quilt can cause the threads to break and fray a better option would be to fold or spread the quilt out on a flat relatively undisturbed surface 4 x research source switch it up if you have multiple collections and plenty of storage space it can be a good idea to swap out your collections from time to time the collection you ve had on display for the past six months can go into storage while the set of antiques you ve had in storage during that time can then be put on display make sure that your antiques are carefully packaged and protected when you place them into storage clean regularly and carefully as dust and other debris gets onto the surface of your antiques you will need to clean the items in your collection make sure that you clean each antique in a way that will minimize the risk of damaging it for most antiques put on display all you should really worry about is periodically removing the dust hard surfaces can be cleaned with a dust rag soft surfaces like quilts and other fabrics can be cleaned with a low powered vacuum be careful about restorative cleaning though some antiques can decrease in value when you make repairs to them,Hobbies-and-Crafts

connected to a wide demographic of fans make a fan page separate from your personal account and use it to talk about upcoming events and new pieces 2 x research source instagram is populated by a younger demographic because it s so image driven it s great to show off sketches works in progress and finished commissions you can also use an instagram page to show off your inspirations like other art you like or museums you ve visited 3 x expert source natasha dikareva mfa ceramics sculpting instructor expert interview 5 may 2020 twitter requires pithiness but it s surprisingly useful leverage your 140 character tweets to promote shows and connect with other artists 4 x research source tumblr allows you to post complete works and is also a great way to build relationships with other artists since a good tumblr is comprised of a mix of original content and artwork you find beautiful 5 x research source start by selling through a third party website many artists start out their online sales not through a private page but through an established website that features lots of up and coming artists there are a few advantages to this you don t have to know how to code to get started and many new buyers feel more comfortable shopping through a website with buyer protections in place here are a few well known art vendors online 6 x research source artsy has been around for a while and encompasses a broad range of style if you have a particularly homespun or cute aesthetic to your work etsy is great spreesy is a newer site that dovetails well with an instagram presence price your

pieces and stick to it consistency is key and if you re worried that you re overcharging a tiny bit for the pieces that you sell that s often a sign that you re charging about the right amount 7 x research source look around in galleries or on other artist s websites to find how much they are charging for similar works you can use this as a baseline and then tailor the price to match your needs and experience level 8 x expert source natasha dikareva mfa ceramics sculpting instructor expert interview 5 may 2020 you can start by charging by the hour for instance if a painting took you ten hours to complete you can value your time at 15 hour and charge 150 for it you can also charge by the linear inch for instance if a painting is 20 by 30 inches and you charge 0 50 per linear inch the total cost would be 300 don t forget to factor in the cost of materials include finishing touches like frames in this calculation take commissions if you ve been building up an online presence and presenting a consistent artistic vision to your fans someone will probably ask you for a custom work sooner or later this is really exciting don t get overwhelmed by the process of working with another person s vision but ask plenty of questions and offer frequent updates make sure to send your portfolio to someone who inquires about a comission they should feel like your style is a good match if you re going to work together 9 x research source for consistency s sake price commissions similarly to other paintings of the same size materials and time commitment ask for a deposit of 25 or so before you begin the piece this will protect you in case the buyer doesn t like the finished product in the unlikely event that the buyer refuses the painting you can keep it and sell it to someone else later 10 x research source pack carefully once you ve made a sale online you ll have to ship out your work wrapping the painting in multiple layers of both hard and soft materials should keep it safe in transit so that it gets to your customer as pristine as it left you 11 x research source start by wrapping the painting in palette wrap an art supply that looks like plastic wrap start by holding the wrap in the back then pull it around to the front and then to the back again align the long edge of the painting with a large piece of cardboard and mark where the short sides rest now flip over the painting along the long edge so that it s in the middle of the cardboard cut along the long edge so that you have a big cardboard rectangle wrap this around the painting and secure it with packing tape cover the cardboard wrapped painting in one or two layers of bubble wrap secure the bubble wrap with packing tape place the bubble wrapped painting in a nice big box then fill in gaps in the box with bubble wrap or packing peanuts finish off by neatly addressing the box and decorating it with a few fragile stickers consider creating your own website if you ve been in the online game for a while it may be time to take your sales to your own private webpage this is a big step and one perhaps best taken if you already have a solid customer base but having your sales and portfolio all bound up under one domain name is professional and elegant 12 x research source you can use basic coding knowledge to make your website using a template service like squarespace or weebly also works if you don t code consider adding a blog to your website this allows for longer form thought than social media does and can also be used to draw attention to upcoming events 13 x research source don t forget to link to your social media and vendors start local fairs and conventions can be a great way to connect with new people and sell your artwork but they can also be expensive there s the cost of your booth itself along with travel expenses and time off of your day job if you have one try to sell first at events close to your home until you have a good grasp on what you need to do to succeed at a convention apply early and with care many conventions start booking their booths nearly a year in advance you ll want to stay on top of deadlines for your chosen events and apply as early as possible most conventions have a set application including a portfolio and an artist s statement this will help the organizers determine if you re a good fit in genre and style 14 x research source however it s just as important to know if the convention is a good fit for you before you apply find out the answers to some of these important questions how much space is each booth allowed is a chair included will there be an outlet nearby is the space accessible especially if you have any mobility considerations be professional when you go to a fair or convention you re not just there to hang out you re there to promote your artwork and your brand be kind to everyone from guests to fellow artists to staff don t let your art spill over onto other people s tables and clean up after yourself pack the artwork you bring carefully and make sure to have extra packing supplies bring business cards too this way even if someone isn t able to buy a painting today they can refer back to you later 15 x research source pay for your booth or table at the convention on time otherwise your spot may go to someone else 16 x research source bring decorations to go with your paintings your paintings are what will hold most people s attention but you ll need to catch their interest first decorate your booth in a way that matches your aesthetic and corresponds to your paintings to draw the eyes of potential customers consider setting out small objects that correspond to your subjects for instance shells if you like painting seascapes bring a nice solid colored tablecloth to make an even professional looking workspace 17 x research source a standing banner with your name an art sample and contact information on it can go almost anywhere and commands attention without being too obnoxious 18 x research source be engaging now that you re all set up be friendly with the people who come by your table smile and say hi to browsers and try to master the art of engaging in conversation without being too pushy you can even consider doing quick commissions like sketches or watercolors for interested buyers 19 x research source if you don t know what to say when someone is looking at your work a smile and a simple hi there or hello works wonders it s easy to engage with buyers with sincere compliments i love your shoes as well use your network your professional network is probably bigger than you think it is and many of the most fruitful business relationships have sprung from personal friendships and connections if you re looking to sell art in a brick and mortar shop or gallery reach out to people you know who might be able to help introduce yourself provide samples of your recent work and ask for what you need 20 x research source you can network in person over the phone or over email just be polite 21 x research source if you re reaching out to your mother s old classmate say hi judy my mother told me a lot about your time together in college i m reaching out because she s mentioned your gallery before and i think it might be a good fit with my work here s a link to my portfolio and website thank you so much for your time check in with old teachers and professors too they often have resources that could help you say i m looking into pushing my career into a more professional stage and i think exhibiting in a gallery could be the next step do you know of any places close by that specialize in young or emerging artists do a portfolio review if you can afford it a portfolio review can help you both focus your art and sell it better generally this involves paying a fee to a jury all the members of whom will sit down with you and talk to you abut the coherence of your work and its marketability this is a step to consider if you really want to take your painting business to the next level 22 x research source be polite to the folks giving you feedback the art world is small and you never know when you re going to run into them again don t get too bogged down by criticism no artist meets with universal acclaim so just concentrate on improving by applying constructive criticism to your work consider consignment look for stores or boutiques in your area who you think would want to carry your items and reach out to ask if they might carry on consignment this way you pay them a portion of the profits if the item is sold consignment is excellent for three main reasons you get publicity you don t pay anything up front and you don t pay rent on the building where they are selling your items 23 x research source submit to galleries the last way to sell your paintings is arguably the one with the most professional appeal through a gallery a gallery is almost like a museum in that it s carefully curated and professionally staffed by art experts except that the art on its walls is for sale apply widely just like if you were applying for a job you probably won t hear back from every one but each contact is valuable when submitting to a gallery stick to the submission process it follows you can find this information on the gallery s website but you ll often be asked for samples and a statement especially if the gallery has a theme 24 x research source submit groups of artwork with coherent ties to one another for instance you could submit a series or several paintings you did at different times that all allude to aztec mythology 25 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to value your art,valuing art is the act of placing a dollar value on a painting sculpture or other artistic work appraising is an art not a science and market trends can quickly cause fluctuations in prices while most people hire an appraisal expert in order to arrive at a dollar value it s possible to arrive at an estimate yourself with just a few pieces of information whether you ve just bought a piece of art are preparing to sell one or are simply curious here s how to make your appraisal a lot less arbitrary,research the artist s output how many works of art did the artist complete the output of the artist in general greatly affects price prolific artists pieces of work tend to be less valuable than those of artists who simply produced less all things being equal find out if there are duplicates is the work one of a kind because of supply and demand works that are singular are worth more than replicated works for this reason a paintings is usually worth more than a print or a lithograph there are simply fewer of them out on the market pinpoint when in the artist s career the work was completed was the work completed early on or toward the twilight of their career interestingly enough works of art completed early in artists careers are usually valued higher than those completed later on 1 x research source why is this although it s not true in all cases early work tends to be more daring passionate and unpredictable sometimes owing to the artist s desire to establish a reputation for him or herself many appraisers believe that as an artist becomes more established in their career their art loses some of its derring do and boldness this artistic predictability is sometimes factored into the valuation ask yourself if the work epitomizes the artist s style works of art that epitomize an artist s aesthetic are usually appraised higher than works of art that are tangential or not representative of the artist s oeuvre pablo picasso s art is indelibly linked to an artistic movement called cubism currently picasso s most expensive painting le rêve which was sold in early 2013 for 155 million falls firmly in that aesthetic 2 x research source it is very emblematic of picasso s style in general investigate whether the artist is well known or has a reputation artists generally fall into three categories of renown well known up and coming and unknown artists who are well known and have a rich history of collection can almost always command more value more than artists who are unknown how much buzz is the artist attracting the more mentions they get in significant publications the better does the artist have any significant showings in galleries or did they in the past has the artist received acclaim from other art institutions such an prizes awards or achievement recognition do any museums own the artist s work artists who find homes for their art in museums can expect a significant uptick in the value of their work know that size matters generally bigger works of art are appraised higher than smaller ones usually because of the degree of difficulty involved find out if the piece of art has ever been owned by someone renowned barring the artist themselves works of art that were formerly owned by someone famous or well known can command much higher prices than those pieces who don t ha or condition issues an item that is ripped water damaged discolored or otherwise damaged can return significantly less than an item that is in perfect shape 3 x research source note that an item that isn t technically damaged but isn t as vibrant as it was when first completed will qualify as having a condition issue cleaning up an artwork or fixing condition issues can have a significant impact on its value cleaning up and fixing condition issues on an artwork can improve its bottom line up to 20 investigate market demand in short how many people want to buy the piece of art art is sold in a market this means that the value of items offered in the market fluctuates depending on how much buyers want the piece as well as how much they are willing to pay ask yourself if the market is in a peak where demand is usually high or a trough where demand is depressed if a glut of pieces enter the market the market price tends to go down if pieces are sold off or if a new group of buyers suddenly becomes active the market price tends to go up this is often referred to as supply and demand look at liquidity liquidity also called marketability is the reliability with which an asset or security can be sold without affecting its asking price 4 x research source in the art world high liquidity means that it s relatively easy to sell an item quickly and thus convert its value into cash low liquidity means that it s harder to do this creating a barrier to converting an asset into cash look at market trends related to demand pricing trends are usually the result of changes in people s perceptions of art or changes in their material circumstances in the early 2010s chinese billionaires flush with money began buying asian art sending demand significantly higher and signalling a new trend in the market 5 x research source as a result of this trend indian and asian art became a hot commodity in the art world collectors are willing to pay more of a premium for art in this market place the art in a primary or secondary market has the work of art been sold before the primary market is what the work of art is valued at when it is first sold the secondary market is what the work of art is valued at after it has been sold at least once the secondary market value has a direct relation to what the item was sold for in the primary market 6 x research source one of the things you want to look out for is a certificate of sale especially if your item has been purchased at an auction referencing this document will make your ultimate appraisal much less subjective look at what other similar pieces of art have sold for if you ve just bough an impressionist painting in the vein of a painting that was just sold for 12 000 all other things being equal that should give you a good benchmark for what your painting may be worth when looking at comparables use a price range instead of a single price art appraisers generally say for example that a sculpture is worth in the 800 1 200 range instead of saying it s worth 1 000 know that one of a kind artworks are difficult to price and somewhat more subject to change an artwork that is truly unique and doesn t have any other analogues against which to compare it is difficult to value the appraisal arrived at is considered to be especially volatile look at scale intensity and medium scale is the size of the artwork and the level of detail intensity is the level of effort put into the artwork medium is the quality of the materials used combine these three aspects together and you should have a better idea of what your artwork is worth 7 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to determine if a painting is an original or reproduction,if you are buying a painting for your own enjoyment buy what you like and what feels reasonable but buying a work of art as an investment is very different it is not so much the art as who painted it and the provenance the proof of the artist s actual connection to the piece,do your homework research the piece know the artist s work look at many of his pieces compare signatures get close ups of the signature increasing your knowledge is critical to examining the piece and knowing what to look for when judging authenticity visit museums study the patinas if you ask to see the back of a painting the staff may show you examine the feel and look of old art works study the depth and number of layers of paint needed to achieve the color desired by the artist 1 x research source look at the front and back of the piece 2 x research source examine the patina of the piece itself dirt and dust of the ages texture the brightness of colors or lack thereof study the canvas do a thread count modern or old is there some patina on the back surface of the canvas look for anachronisms if the canvas is stapled on the back of a 1800 s piece of art something is wrong look at the patina of the wood to determine whether the wood is old determine how the frame is put together considering what kind of nails and hanger are used 3 x research source look for bristles painted copies sometimes will have hairs from the cheap paint brush still in the paint on the canvas 4 x research source use your nose when you do get your hands on the painting smell it it takes oil a while to dry and years to completely lose the smell of oil 5 x research source decide about how the piece feels to you balance everything many fakes for example have no depth of paint layers it s easy to copy a piece electronically but a photo copier cannot get the layers of paint a real piece has 6 x research source check for consistency a fake painted copy needs everything else to match frame wise and a patina is hard to reproduce get the work appraised if it is something you are in love with you need a third party to independently review it someone who is not in love how do you know if the appraiser is reliable he or she should have a certificate from one or more of the professional associations of art appraisers have a history of work with the particular artist or medium or period and preferably not be a dealer or broker of art himself one example is bernard ewell who is an expert in salvador dali whose prints are often copied research the market history of the artist what have other works of this artist sold for at other auction houses this size time frame and same medium 7 x research source note that some dealers perhaps including those on cruise ships may attempt to confuse the buyer with sizes and periods even mediums to sell a lesser piece at inflated prices look for signature and number for prints they must be signed and numbered signed in stone is of little interest because unlimited copies can be drawn 8 x research source research the gallery many pieces will have gallery stickers or information written on the back research that gallery to learn whether it is look for signs of wear there should be some signs of wear on the frame even the canvas sometimes wooden edges not quite as sharp after 50 100 years and drier research the artist for reputation know that some artists are known to have signed blank paper which later have prints drawn on from them which means the artist did not even supervise the pulls these would be of significantly lesser value salvador dali was know to have done this beware of a scam where the print is not numbered but another document is which is meaningless as any signed in stone can be used in place of the real item 9 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to talk about art,talking about art can be intimidating especially if you are not knowledgeable about the artist or the work of art you don t have to be an expert to look at experience and talk about art in fact art will often have a different impact on different people in order to talk about art learn appropriate terminology discuss the content of the image and assess how you feel about the image you can also spend time looking at the piece and reading up on the image and artist this will provide you with more information to discuss,talk about the materials used a variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect for example sculptors can use stone marble wire or wood to create their art similarly painters can use watercolours oil chalk and pencil when you are looking at art comment on the materials or medium used to create the image if you can t identify them look at the label 1 x research source identify the style of art in order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art learn to identify the style of art for example some common and recognizable styles include abstract realist expressionist surrealist or impressionist a piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real almost like a photograph 2 x research source alternatively an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art for example search for impressionist images visit museums which often group art by style you may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings for instance consider the content the style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image for example learn the differences between portraits image of a person landscapes image of a place or still life image of an object works of art 3 x research source familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms it is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art you can use them to describe the mood of the painting as you perceive it dynamic intimate suggestive challenging check the time period of the piece you may have heard of renaissance art modern art or cubism before these are a few different time periods and movements within art history to talk about a work of art check its time period consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created consider the movements that were happening at that time for example cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century artists such as picasso departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images 4 x research source think about any major world events such as war that may be reflected in the piece consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made works that may not seem shocking now might have been then or vice versa talk about the composition and placement composition refers to the ways in which objects or shapes are arranged within a work of art for instance shapes may be placed near each other overlapping spaced apart or arranged in a pattern this influences the order in which you observe parts of the painting 5 x research source one way to notice things about the composition is to see where your eyes go naturally when you look at the painting for example you could say i m seeing that the artist has painted bright lights around the figure of the baby it makes it really hard to look away from that corner of the painting 6 x research source comment on the lines and brush strokes in some paintings you will be able to clearly see the brushstrokes and technique on the canvas you can comment on the way the brush strokes catch your eye and give texture to the image at other times paintings can look smooth almost like a photograph in this case the artist is likely going for a real life effect 7 x research source you could say this piece looks just like a photograph how does the artist create such smooth lines alternately you may notice really thick brushstrokes or blobs of paint you can comment on the sculptural thickness of layered paint notice the colors and contrast colour is another important element in art and can be used to capture your attention colours can create a contrast between light and dark or complement each other in a visually stimulating way when talking about art discuss how the color makes you feel and what you think it communicates 8 x research source for instance you could say the light and dark contrast in this image makes a sharp distinction between good and evil in this piece you can comment on the feeling of the painting that the color communicates this bright piercing blue invokes so much joy yet the muted red tones of the background feel more like a warning avoid delivering unnecessary judgements art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good as a result you may offend people by giving harsh criticism instead you can comment on the art itself without saying whether or not you like it this allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings avoid saying things like i could make that this type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation if you do dislike a piece you can explain that it s due to your personal taste for instance you can say i can see this is well composed i have trouble looking at this image though because it s so dynamic it almost feels violent ask questions a great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions if you re going to talk about art questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question get the opinion of your companion about a piece acknowledge that you are not an expert if you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you re viewing feel free to admit to confusion at any point some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone 9 x research source pretending to know a lot will be awkward and isn t necessary you might say wow i can tell a lot is going on here but i don t know where to start talk about how the art makes you feel the most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something even if that feeling is unpleasant comment on how the piece makes you feel and why sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable this does not mean you need to judge the quality of work just the impression that the piece has left on you 10 x research source for example you may feel inspired sad happy confused uncomfortable angry etc take a long look at the piece of art most people only glance at a piece of art for example a survey done at the louvre found that the average person spends 15 seconds looking at the mona lisa this is not enough time to truly engage with a work of art try to spend at least a minute preferably longer looking at a piece of art this will allow you to take in the image look at the detail of the composition and determine how you feel about the piece by spending time looking at art you will more likely be able to talk about the piece and some of the finer details 11 x research source if you are able to stare at a work of art for long periods of time you may begin to create a dialogue with the piece this can be extremely interesting as you begin to see how the picture speaks to you read the title and description of the piece art galleries and museums will often place a small plaque near each piece to give the title and a small description this can sometimes provide you with details to help you interpret and discuss the art for example you may see a knot of light pink lines and feel confused upon reading the plaque you learn that the title of the work is my struggle with breast cancer the title of this piece may help you better understand what is being communicated through the art plaques can also include detailed information about the materials used date that it was created etc read up on the artist some galleries will also provide detailed information about the artists this material may be found in a pamphlet or in a small biography near the artwork learning about the artist may help you understand a bit about their interests and what inspired them to create this art this will give you more to discuss about the art,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to appreciate art,art can often seem inaccessible because it has been stereotyped in popular culture as something that only particularly educated or wealthy people can enjoy however this couldn t be further from the truth anyone can come to appreciate art with a little bit of time and effort learning about the context around a work of art understanding the craft and using your imagination to bring your own interpretation to art can help you enjoy it more,understand the historical context of the time when the art was produced artists often create works to comment on major historical events and this can give you a window into their unique perspective in contrast powerful institutions and people throughout history often commissioned artists to create pieces that endorsed their agendas this affects the intended audience of the art piece who was meant to see the art 1 x research source for example pablo picasso s guernica 1937 was created in response to the bombings during the spanish civil war it s filled with anti war symbolism 2 x research source picasso said of the artwork painting is not done to decorate apartments it is an instrument of war against brutality and darkness 3 x research source during the renaissance the roman catholic church relied a lot on commissioned art as a means of promoting their cause and asserting their power find out the genre of the painting if you re looking at a painting knowing what genre it belongs to can be helpful genres are essentially categories that are used to classify art in painting the established and well known genres are landscape portraiture genre paintings which are paintings of scenes from ordinary life history and still life 4 x research source john constable s the hay wain 1821 is a famous landscape painting that led to the resurgence of landscape painting in the 19th century 5 x research source girl with a pearl earring 1665 by johannes vermeer is considered to be a masterpiece of portraiture 6 x research source judith leyster s carousing couple 1630 is a great example of a genre painting 7 x research source history paintings depict a moment in a specific historical narrative vasily surikov s the morning of the streltsy execution 1881 is a very intricate history painting example 8 x research source lastly still life paintings are of inanimate commonplace objects van gogh s sunflowers 1889 is a bright and sunny still life example 9 x research source learn about the art movements or schools that influenced the piece art movements were surges in popularity of certain ways of creating art an art school is basically just a group of artists sometimes all in the same region who all have a similar style or subject matter knowing a little bit about these can help you understand why an artist might have made certain choices for example painters in the egyptian school of art had certain rules that they had to follow like the size of any figure they drew was supposed to vary based on the social status of the person they were painting they also couldn t use more than six colors and each color symbolized a different aspect of life or death impressionism one of the largest 19th century art movements is defined by short loose brushstrokes that are intended to capture the quality of light 10 x research source read up on the life and perspective of the artist learning a bit about the artist who created a piece can help shed light on it in a variety of ways it can help you understand why they made certain artistic decisions or chose to make the work at all in the first place 11 x research source for example mexican painter frida kahlo had limited mobility after fighting off polio and enduring a bus accident in her early life her pain and struggle manifests in several of her pieces 12 x research source learn when the piece was produced art museums typically have informational plaques next to each work that will provide basic information about the piece knowing when a piece of artwork was created can help you appreciate the difficulty involved in making it for instance landscape paintings produced before the rise of photography which began to include landscapes around 1860 were definitely more challenging to do 13 x research source identify the medium that was used to make the art a medium refers to the material used to create a piece of art the type of material used affects how the artist made the piece if you can t tell which medium was used museums or galleries will often state the medium of an artwork on informational plaques oil and acrylic paints are examples of media for painters while bronze and marble are media for sculptors with the rise of modern art media has expanded to include not just types of paint and stone but also materials like found appropriated objects or even bodily excretions this has led to the creation of the term mixed media which is used when talking about an art piece made from a variety of materials 14 x research source recognize the artist s effort to convey lines for visual works notice the artist s ability to create confident lines lines are created when an artist draws or paints marks on a page when a sculptor bends or shapes material or when a photographer angles their camera a certain way some ways to describe lines are dashed bold rough smooth or implied 15 x research source pay attention to the shapes that stand out in the painting note any interesting shapes that grab your eye when you look at a piece of art and think about how the artist achieved them shapes can be geometric or organic geometric shapes are simple commonly recognized shapes like squares or rectangles organic shapes are unique and free form looking at still life paintings of fruit is a great way to understand how artists have experimented with shape 16 x research source notice how the artist uses color ask yourself why the artist chose to use the combination of colors that they did and if these colors work in harmony or contrast color has an enormous effect on how we feel when we look at a piece for example pieces with blue undertones are known to have a calming effect on the viewer meanwhile yellow is associated with light and feelings of optimism 17 x research source study the brushwork of a painted piece brushwork or the way that the artist applied paint using their brush really sticks out when you are looking at paintings in person it s used to create certain effects in the art contributing to both texture and mood for example the feathery light brushwork in impressionist paintings is intended to mimic the qualities of light harsh and erratic brush strokes can communicate a sense of tension and anxiety in a piece 18 x research source keep an open mind you will never know if you like or don t like certain types of art if you don t try to enjoy them you can think of going to see new kinds of art as exposing yourself to new experiences rather than just seeing art 19 x research source evaluate how a work of art makes you feel be in touch with your own emotions as you view art do you feel excited calm anxious confused art can evoke a wide range of emotional responses so do your best to be conscious of yours offer your own interpretation of what the art means part of the fun of viewing art is that you get to come up with your own story about it art is very subjective so even if your interpretation of a piece isn t exactly what the artist intended it s okay there is often not just one right answer what s important is that you make a genuine effort to extract meaning from their work 20 x research source because every person has a different set of unique experiences it s valid for every person who views a piece of art to walk away with a different understanding of it this can lead to interesting discussions ask the person next to you what they think 21 x research source it s also completely fine to offer no interpretation at all and instead just enjoy the art for its physical properties 22 x research source applaud the ambiguity of abstraction abstract art art that doesn t look like anything in the real world can be a little harder to appreciate because the message or emotion that the artist is trying to convey is not always immediately clear to enjoy abstract art think about what grabs your eye first in the piece and why the artist might have wanted your attention to go there abstract art can be fun because it s like a puzzle you really have to give it some thought to come up with a potential meaning for it remember your meaning doesn t have to be necessarily correct learn what you like and don t like as you view more and more art you will start to develop an understanding of what you like and dislike in a piece of art this can help you seek out similar artists you don t have to love everything that you see artist statements or descriptive brochures can sometimes be misleading so if you unexpectedly don t like a certain type of art that s fine 23 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to arrange artwork on a wall,arranging art on a blank wall can seem overwhelming at first the trick is to let your art personal style and the space itself guide your decisions figure out whether you d prefer a uniform or eclectic look and decide what would look best in the available space look for themes in your collection and choose objects that fit the tone you re trying to achieve play around with various configurations until you ve found the right balance when it s time to hang your arrangement make careful measurements to precisely position your artworks,look for themes within your collection if you need to decide which works of art to display try to come up with a theme look through your collection think about your style and decide what kind of tone you want to achieve figure out whether you prefer uniformity or more eclectic looks and decide what would look best in your space 1 x research source suppose you have lot of works in one genre such as portraits or landscapes and want a more uniform look you could create an arrangement of works solely in that genre and use frames with consistent sizes and colors if you like visual puns and storytelling look for objects in your collection that relate to each other in clever or interesting ways for instance a pair of portraits might seem to glance at each other as if they re laughing at the same joke combine contrasting colors and forms for an energetic arrangement if you want a vibrant dynamic look choose a wide array of colors and artistic styles mix up abstract works with representational landscapes portraits and still lifes include as mediums as you have in your collection such as paintings drawings prints and photographs 2 x research source display black and white or monochromatic works for a subtle look for a more minimalist chic look look for artworks that fit a particular color scheme you could arrange black and white photographs charcoal drawings and black and white paintings black and white frames would reinforce your arrangement s uniformity 3 x research source if you re going for a cohesive arrangement but still want a pop of color you could go for a monochromatic look for example display works together that are all predominantly blue use frames to create uniformity or variety while frames shouldn t overwhelm artworks you can use them to complement your arrangement s theme mix up your frames to create a dynamic look or use frames with consistent sizes and colors to impart unity 4 x research source for example suppose you want to cluster several similar works but don t want your arrangement to be static use frames with different sizes and materials to add variety to your collection 5 x research source if you want to unify a broad range of mediums colors and sizes use all black frames wood frames or frames with equal thicknesses choose an arrangement that suits the space the wall itself should guide your composition s form for instance fill an irregular narrow nook with a clustered floor to ceiling arrangement 6 x research source suppose you have a large rectangular dining room with a long table a linear arrangement of artworks displayed in equally sized frames and hung at the same height will complement the room s horizontal lines 7 x research source work your furniture into your arrangement make sure your artwork doesn t crowd your furniture and that your furniture doesn t obscure your artwork additionally set your furniture layout before arranging your artwork you wouldn t want to hang a floor to ceiling arrangement then hide or risk damaging a painting by placing a chair in front of it 8 x research source if you re placing artwork over a bed or a sofa hang it about 8 inches 20 cm above the headboard or sofa back large scale works hung above a large piece of furniture should be between 65 and 85 percent of the furniture s width larger works could dwarf your furniture and smaller works could leave too much blank space 9 x research source go with a grid if you have several equally sized works grids work best for series of images that are all framed exactly the same while artworks in an array of colors scales and mediums can add variety the frames dimensions should match precisely 10 x research source for example you could mix up drawings or paintings on paper colorful prints and black and white photographs frame them in equally sized white frames with white matting then hang them in a uniform grid keep in mind you ll have to hang a grid as precisely as possible a grid s uniformity will magnify even the slightest misalignment cluster your works salon style if you want an eclectic arrangement dramatic eclectic salon style installations are popular in contemporary interior design however a salon style arrangement is more complicated than randomly hanging artworks wall to wall and floor to ceiling take the time to find a configuration that balances works color palettes proportions and other visual elements 11 x research source for instance mix up scales to create a balanced composition instead of clustering small works on one side of the arrangement and larger works on the other pay attention to frames too scatter frames styles evenly instead of grouping ornate frames in one part of the arrangement and simple frames in the other strike a balance between clustered and geometric styles you don t have to choose between a strict grid and dramatic salon style cluster for the best of both worlds choose artworks in a range of mediums with various color palettes and scales arrange them in a balanced configuration that defines a square or rectangular area 12 x research source for example 2 large scale objects could define the upper right and lower left corners of a rectangular arrangement you could then use groupings of smaller works to define the rectangle s other corners arrange your art on the floor to find the best composition when you have a general idea of the look you want to achieve lay the works on the floor experiment with different configurations and move them around to see how various colors forms subject matter and scales relate 13 x research source planning out how your works colors and proportions relate is especially important if you re going for a clustered or salon style look when you play with arrangements avoid crowding artworks leave about 1 1 2 inches 3 8 cm between smaller objects and about 2 inches 5 1 cm between large scale works 14 x research source set focal points 60 inches 150 cm high after arranging your artworks on the floor and finding the right configuration figure out how high you should hang them the general guideline is to hang an image so its center is 60 inches 150 cm high for a grid or cluster you d set the focal point or center of the arrangement at that height however that figure isn t set in stone and there are plenty of exceptions to the rule 15 x research source for example if you have high ceilings you might need to hang works higher to minimize blank space between them and the ceiling you might also need to make adjustments in order to leave enough space between an image and a large piece of furniture 16 x research source the height guideline doesn t really apply if you re going for a floor to ceiling wall to wall look tape paper templates of your artworks to the wall trace templates of your artworks on butcher paper or newspaper cut them out and tape them to the wall in your desired configuration shift them around to make final touches to your layout such as setting enough space between artworks and adjusting hanging heights 17 x research source use low adhesive masking tape so you can shift the templates around without pulling off your wall s paint use a bubble level to double check your templates levelness if you have a laser level project level lines where you want to hang templates mark the templates top center points when you ve found the right arrangement measure a template s width at its top edge and locate its center point use a post it note piece of tape a pencil to mark the top center point repeat the sequence for each template 18 x research source measure 2 hanger locations on each artwork place a finger on either side of the hanging wire about 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm from the edges of the frame or canvas pull the wire toward the top of the object to simulate the wire s position when it hangs on picture hooks measure the distance between your fingers and the object s center then measure the distance between the pulled wire and the top of the object 19 x research source for instance suppose you pull the wire at points 3 inches 7 6 cm to the left and right of the frame s vertical center imagine a line going through the center of the frame from top to bottom then when you pull the wire toward the frame s top there are 2 inches 5 1 cm between the wire and frame s top you ll note those measurements and use them to nail picture hooks into the wall at the right spots hanging artwork with 2 hooks keeps it from shifting around which helps maintain levelness and prevents wall damage for works without hanging wires such as those with d rings measure the distance from the ring or hook to the top of the frame mark the hanger locations on the wall find the post it tape or pencil mark for a template s top center point at the top edge measure the distances to the right and left where you placed your fingers and pulled the wire from those points measure the distance between the pulled wire and top of the template then mark those spots 20 x research source for example measure 3 inches 7 6 cm to the left of the center point from that spot measure 2 inches 5 1 cm down from the top edge then make a mark repeat the steps on the right side and mark the spot that s 3 inches 7 6 cm to the right of the center point and 2 inches 5 1 cm from the top edge to mark your spots draw a dot on the template with a pencil or make an indentation with a nail factor in your picture hooks when you make your marks if your picture hooks hang below the nail that supports them measure the distance between the hook where the hanging wire will rest and the hole where the nail fits factor this number into your measurements to avoid hanging your artworks slightly lower than you desired for instance if the wire will rest on a hook 1 2 inch 1 3 cm below the nail hole hammer the nail into the wall 1 2 inch 1 3 cm above the mark you made in the previous step if you don t make the adjustment your artwork will hang 1 2 inch 1 3 cm lower than you planned nail picture hooks into the wall place the picture hook against the wall line its nail hole up with the mark on the template then hammer a nail through the hook into the wall you can hammer nails straight into the marks you made on the templates then tear away the template when you ve installed both hooks just make sure you keep track of which object goes in that spot 21 x research source hang your artwork and double check levelness finish hammering before you start hanging your art after hammering the last nail start mounting your arrangement use a bubble level to check each object s levelness then step back and admire your handiwork,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to arrange artwork at home,arranging your artwork properly can enhance the look of any room in your house if done correctly it will help the flow of the room and add to the style and aesthetic that you re trying to achieve the only problem with arranging your artwork is that it isn t always so intuitive luckily if you plan and choose your arrangement carefully you can arrange your artwork to enhance the look of your house or apartment,choose the appropriate method to hang your artwork based on its size methods to display your art at home include hanging it leaning it against the wall or placing your artwork on top of a shelf determine how you want to display your art at home and utilize a venue that works with the quality and size of the art for instance larger and heavier pieces of art could be leaned against the wall while lighter pieces of artwork can be matted or hung on the wall it s best to lean large heavy pieces of art against the wall or your art may be knocked over or stepped on use photo frames that can be propped up if you re placing your art on a shelf you can also lean your art against the wall for medium sized pieces but they may fall and break more expensive pieces of art should be framed and hung on the wall black and white photographs of family and friends can be placed on top of a shelf expand your idea of what art can be you can frame postcards maps old collages or scrapbooking pages as an inexpensive alternative to traditional artwork prints or posters can be matted and then attached to the wall select your aesthetic style the easiest way to determine your preferred aesthetic is to simply choose art that you like think of how the art that you choose reflects your personality as well as the effect that the art will have the on space choose bright and expressive art to lighten up a dark room or darker colored art to show your maturity and refinement if you re looking to convey an edgy urban style hanging brightly colored pop art or graffiti art may be a great option black and white photography can add a sense of refinement to your space determine how it will affect the look of furniture in your space objects like desks tables and couches can affect the way that you should arrange your art depending on where they are located for instance when hanging art above a couch the art should be 6 to 8 inches 15 2 to 20 3 centimeters above the top of the couch 1 x research source other things should also be taken into consideration include making sure your art matches the tone and style of the room you can achieve this by matching the art s color palette with the color of your furniture and wallpaper another example is if you have a refined and adult looking study using refined looking figure drawing or scene art could help enhance the look of other things in your room if you have rustic art but a modern sofa separate them in the room to avoid the two styles clashing arrange your artwork on top of a piece of butcher paper before you hang your artwork and create unnecessary screw or nail holes you can lay it out on the ground to get a feeling for how it will look when finally hung lay down a large piece of disposable paper and lay your artwork over it configure your art by starting with the largest pieces and then arranging your smaller pieces around it envision how it will look on your wall and choose a configuration that you find aesthetically pleasing rectangle square and diamond frames typically look best when hanging art smaller pieces of art look best when grouped 1 to 2 inch 2 5 5 cm apart from one another while larger pieces of art typically look best with a 3 inch 7 6 cm border around them 2 x research source cut out the butcher paper around your photos use a marker to make an outline around your artwork onto the paper remove your artwork once you are done and cut out the outlines you drew you ll use these pieces of paper to act as a visualization of how your artwork will look on the wall 3 x research source if you rearrange your artwork on the floor next to your sheet of paper you can save your design so you don t forget where your pieces of art should go tape your butcher paper to the wall once you ve finished cutting out all of your pieces you can now hang it on the wall with scotch tape it s possible that your layout will look very differently on the wall than it did on the floor the centerpiece of your art arrangement should be about 5 feet 1 5 meters tall so it s eye level with most people 4 x research source if you have high ceilings you can opt to hang the art higher than usual avoid placing your art above eye level in a room with standard ceilings as this can make your room look imbalanced evaluate your layout and rearrange it take a couple of steps back and assess how your arrangement looks on your wall if you re unsure taking a break may allow your brain the rest it needs to evaluate the layout objectively 5 x research source if you don t like something about it move your pieces of paper around until the layout looks perfect arranging the layout perfectly in this step will help you avoid drilling unnecessary holes when you hang your art if your floors are uneven using a level may help you line up your artwork ask a friend to give you a second opinion regarding the positioning of the art before hanging it they can help you determine what s most visually pleasing hang your art replace your pieces of paper with the artwork that you intend on hanging mark where you want the art to hang with a pencil hang your art on your wall using a nail or other mounting method popular mounting methods include using a wall anchor a nail or a hanging hook when hanging larger and heavier artwork you may need to use a drill to drive larger anchors into your wall studs 6 x research source command hooks and easy off tape are great hanging alternatives if you re a renter or don t want to damage your walls use the same frames and matting different styles and colors of frames will throw off your arrangements cohesion use frames that have a similar style size and thickness 7 x research source if you have a bunch of mismatched frames a cheap and easy solution is to paint them all the same color 8 x research source matting is the material that s used behind the photo and should also have a uniform tone though it doesn t always need to be the same color your artwork should maintain a uniform color across your different pieces if you want to save money you can paint mismatched frames the same color leaving frames mismatched can also create an eclectic look if that s your style take a look at the dominant colors in your artwork and choose a mat that shares the same colors typically artwork has a focal point and your mat should be the same color as the focal point of the artwork use high contrast mat colors to add drama to a set of artwork 9 x research source determine if you want symmetry or asymmetry hung art can either be symmetrical or asymmetrical but should be consistent wherever you are arranging it symmetry is when your art corresponds to size shape and spacing in relative position to a center line on the x axis when you reach symmetry your arranged artwork will look centered and balanced if you have various sized frames or art it may be a better idea to create an asymmetrical look asymmetry is also useful when hanging abstract art 10 x research source to hang your art symmetrically either imagine or draw a center line horizontally on your wall parallel with the floor hang your pieces centered on that line this is much easier to achieve when all of your art is the same size to hang your art asymmetrically imagine or draw a center line and vary the height and distance of each piece of art about the line if you want to hang a piece of art above some furniture find the center of the furniture piece not the center of the wall this will help your art look centered in the room to the eye create a theme the way that you group your hanging artwork is important try to group art that shares a similar aesthetic or theme among your collection for instance you can arrange family photos together art that shares a similar style or black and white only or color only photography this will give your art arrangement a deeper feeling of cohesion your artwork should be a representation of who you are or what you like try to achieve that by using pieces that you feel represent you choose a theme to create an interesting gallery wall that reflects your style you can go nautical rustic modern or shabby chic for example,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to become an art investor,art investors are individuals who buy works of art with the intention of selling them at a later date for a profit they typically specialize in a single genre medium or period in art history and can focus on buying and selling in the local or international market becoming an art investor can be difficult you have to have a strong understanding of major trends in art as well as the ability to recognize whether the market for art is healthy or not however once you know how to analyze and interpret art it can be an incredibly rewarding way to make money to become an

public the secondary market is where current owners of a work buy and sell art the primary market can be hard to interpret without knowing what the secondary market s demand is but it s also where you stand to make the most money from an artist or auction house underpricing a work 8 x research source start by looking for lesser known artists that have some buzz look at reviews of gallery openings and write down the names of any artists that receive praise for interesting work don t pay attention to reviews that focus on technical skill instead look for criticism that describes the work as forward thinking or visionary this is often an indicator that an artist has tapped into a unique style or process that may catch on as time goes on 10 x research source the art market doesn t generally focus on the technical ability of an artist when determining value instead a price is usually predicated on the artist s process a piece s thematic elements and the context of a work as a general rule of thumb avoid purchasing art from students that are still in master s or ph d programs it can be impossible to tell how the market will or won t respond to their work identify famous

they ll be able to help you get started as a collector smaller galleries tend to have very active owners that will be willing to chat about potential investments you ll get more information and knowledge from local gallery owners than major museum curators who won t really take you seriously at first go to art fairs and interact with the artists art fairs represent a rare opportunity to expose yourself to large quantities of art all at once they also provide an opportunity to interact with a large number of artists since the art at art fairs is usually sold directly by the artist introduce yourself to painters photographers and fine artists whose work you re interested in 12 x research source even if you don t end up buying anything you ll learn a lot simply by talking to artists about their processes and how they end up establishing prices based on the demand for their work art fairs are also a good way to judge the local demand in your market if art fairs in your area tend to be empty and poorly attended it may be a sign that it s a bad area for you to be looking to buy and sell attend auctions to meet other investors fine art auctions are a tremendous resource for networking with other investors in your field introduce yourself to the people that bid on works at an auction and ask them about their investment strategy talk to them about their collection and exchange phone numbers to stay in touch if you can build a relationship with other investors you may be able to get the inside scoop on rare collections and insider opportunities in the future 13 x research source auctions are events where potential buyers bid against one another to buy expensive goods they have their own set of social norms and rules so they may seem overwhelming at first to play it safe don t plan on bidding at the first couple of auctions that you attend auctions are usually free and open to the public high end auction houses may require tickets but they usually only use them to know when they re at capacity so they re usually free 14 x research source contact an artist directly to look into buying their work if you stumble upon an artist with work that you re interested in contact them via email or show up at a gallery opening and tell them that you re interested in potentially buying their work they ll likely have more work that they d be able to show you and you ll be able to learn more about a specific piece that you re interested in buying 15 x research source most artists have personal websites where they showcase and sell their work some artists will be resistant to working with a buyer that wants to buy their art as an investment especially if they re well established in their field many established artists have representatives and agents that deal with potential buyers if you know an artist is being represented contacting them directly can come off as an insult to the artist enlist gallery owners to keep an eye out for work you re interested in gallery owners make a living buying and selling art they are likely to be regularly purchasing or soliciting investable art ask gallery owners to keep an eye out for work that you might be interested in buying you ll be the first person they call when they come across a potential investment 16 x research source hire an evaluator to appraise your art before buying or selling evaluators are professional appraisal experts and their estimates hold quite a bit of weight when it comes to selling or buying art a professional evaluation will put potential buyers at ease since they ll know that they aren t overpaying for a work inversely a professional evaluation will let you know whether or not a potential purchase is worth considering at its available price 17 x research source most galleries and studios have specific evaluators that they work with ask about evaluations when inquiring about a piece s price contact the gallery that you bought a piece from before selling it gallery owners will appreciate the ability to offer a piece to their clients before you put it on the open market without their assistance apart from being a courtesy it s possible that the original gallery owner will have buyers readily available for you since they re in contact with other people that are likely to have the same tastes in art 18 x research source market your art online before going to an auction house or private seller an easy way to test whether an evaluation is accurate or not is to try listing the work online for a price higher than its been evaluated at you may be able to get a higher price than you d expect by using a non traditional venue to sell your work this will also give you a sense if the original appraisal is an accurate representation of what a piece of art is worth at the current moment 19 x research source lumas society 6 saatchiart and artfinder are all reputable online venues to sell works of fine art don t panic and sell too quickly if the market turns if the international market takes a dip during a recession or slow period don t lose your cool the market for fine art can be fickle but that doesn t mean that you should sell at the first sign of trouble fine art is usually a long term investment and you should generally hold on to assets during tumultuous periods in the market 20 x research source hold a purchase when in doubt if you haven t gotten an evaluation that you re happy with and the market isn t particularly strong hold on to your investment holding on to an asset is the best way to let it appreciate over time especially if you ve got your hands on a piece created by an up and coming or well established artist it can take time for a work to appreciate in value so be patient you may end up waiting for quite some time if you want to get high prices for your work so don t buy a piece expecting to always sell it off right away,Hobbies-and-Crafts

at auctions and see if they have any tips for newcomers to the auction scene attend art auctions that are within your price range big name auction houses such as christie s in new york tend to set higher prices for the work being auctioned off if you re working with a smaller budget stick to smaller regional auction houses that tend to have lower price points 5 x research source if you live in a small or medium sized town you may not even know about any auction houses in your area try searching online for auction houses in your town and consider making your purchases there note that just because an auction house is small this doesn t necessarily mean that the works being auctioned off are not valuable ask for a discount if you re buying from a gallery for the first time artwork can be

will both feel is fair 6 x research source galleries will often reduce the price of an item for first time buyers if they re looking to develop a relationship with them don t be afraid to ask for a lower price familiarize yourself with the dealers and ask others about them you might learn from others who have bought art from a certain gallery that it s relatively expensive or tacks on lots of hidden fees buy from galleries that you ve bought art from before there is immense value in being a valued customer when shopping for art nurse a rapport with gallery owners so that they will make you aware of the best values and the newest pieces coming into the gallery before other buyers 7 x research source gallery owners may also reward repeat customers with lower prices as part of their long term business strategy consider buying art online for cheaper options the internet has made it possible for relatively unknown artists who can t get their works into galleries or auctions to still make their work available for purchase if your budget is tight or you want to buy work from artists who aren t established yet consider making your purchase online 8 x research source some of the most popular sites to buy art from include minted tiny showcase and art com buying art online also makes it easy for you to find art of a particular style or genre for example lumas com specializes in high quality photography while tappan collective focuses entirely on art produced by emerging artists 9 x research source find out what the relative values of different types of art are the first rule of investing is to buy when prices are low and wait for the value of what you buy to increase do background research on what types of artwork are more or less valuable at the moment and see which types are poised to grow in value 10 x research source note that if you buy a piece of art at a bargain price it may be because nobody else wanted to buy it and it failed to sell at auction you may have to wait as long as 10 years for these works of art to rise in value consider beginning your research at an art fair art fairs will give you a starting point so that you can narrow your gallery search down and avoid visiting ones that don t feature what you want diversify the type of art that you invest in artwork in a particular genre or by a particular artist can fluctuate wildly in price especially if it s more contemporary in nature for this reason make sure you re diversifying your investments by buying art from a variety of artworks styles and types 11 x research source don t limit yourself to any one type of art be willing to invest in decorative art e g porcelains as well as fine art e g paintings and sculptures buy the highest quality art you can afford although much of the value of a given work of art stems from who the artist is art of a higher quality is nearly always worth more than lower quality work when deciding on art to invest in opt for quality instead of quantity 12 x research source works of higher quality are also far more likely to appreciate in value over time making them much better long term investments determining which pieces of art are higher quality will require you to either acquire a working knowledge of art history and movements or hire an art advisor who can help you decide which pieces to invest in purchase works by emerging artists for potentially greater profits works by relatively unknown or young artists tend to be cheaper and have great potential for increasing in value buy cheap works from up and coming artists if you re looking to turn your investments into possible short term windfalls 13 x research source note that this is an inherently risky endeavor as not all art is guaranteed to increase in value you probably shouldn t spend all of your money on this type of art if you re looking to invest for the best results look for art that is featured in cutting edge galleries or museum shows and that was painted by someone whose work has not been featured before acquire art on the primary market if you re looking to flip it there are two types of market in the art world primary and secondary the primary market is for buying works that have not been previously owned i e new works of art and are thus relatively inexpensive while the secondary market is for buying previously owned works through a gallery or auction 14 x research source buying art on the primary market will almost always be less expensive than buying art on the secondary market thus if you re able to resell that art to a gallery or at an auction it usually results in a net profit for you,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to start an art collection,art is subjective fascinating and driven by passion here are some top tips on how you can get involved,figure out your own motives do you want something to brighten up your room or match the curtains or are you hoping to make money from the recovering art market or are you attracted to art as a fascinating long term commitment be aware that each of the above motivations are relevant and each requires a different game plan if you are looking for something you like then it s easy go with your gut feelings if you are investing then you must do your homework and build contacts in the art world that you can trust in other words you can buy art from a west london heavyweight dealer and be assured of its quality but end up spending more money or you can go to an east london gallery that showcases young artists and spend less money but with more risk whichever you choose you must be prepared know that rarity equals value as well as quality so one off originals are more valuable than multiple prints paintings drawings and collages are normally one offs but sculptures are often produced in editions of nine understand the smaller the edition the higher the price one way to make sure of this is that the artwork you like is signed and numbered this is also true of photographs of course photos can be reproduced very easily so seek verification do your research is the artist dead then make sure that the photo is vintage ie authorized by him or her if the photo is modern then does it come with the original negative to ensure that it isn t a copy also in today s age of digital photography some studios make a point of producing hand printed signed originals educate yourself art they say is an intellectual pursuit your collection should be embraced as an educational process develop your art taste buds by looking at lots of art and hone your appreciation for the aesthetics learn about the different artists how they have progressed over time for instance and feel your passion grow develop an understanding of the artists a good way to do this is to start with drawings buy posters and postcards and put them on the walls of your home or desk this will train your eye and help you realize the aspects of art you love and those you find forgettable choose the art that s right for you collectors have many different methods for choosing the works they wish to buy a prolific and globally renowned collector like david geffen the very wealthy record label executive often cites the wow factor in other words he buys art which makes him think wow go out and view lots of artworks getting to know what you are like as a collector requires that you do so also museums galleries and auctioneers are making themselves increasingly accessible to collectors so join their mailing lists talk your own language always remember there is no right way to discuss art so don t be shy when you meet connoisseurs also don t worry that you know nothing about art you know what you know and must feel free and confident to talk about it in your own language you don t need to spend a lot of money in terms of money remember that collecting is an evolutionary process look at some of the greatest collections in the world they started with initial purchases or just a few thousand dollars and were then built upwards good art dealers appreciate this and will work with you to build your collection up above all don t rush it is vital that you take your time find a dealer that you can trust this will generally be a dealer who makes themselves available and will work with you to learn and slowly build up your significant collection the best dealers are like counselors and should be worthy of your trust avoid salespeople especially those who sell art as a commodity art collecting revolves around passion and belief relying on saleability as your ultimate goal simply won t work also remember that a dealer who trusts their own choices won t refer to an artwork s price history as their primary justification an artwork s price history on its own is no guarantee of anything and will only give you other people s possibly inaccurate predictions get the price right while price should never be your main driving factor look at the amounts works have been selling for at auctions or at past shows ask your dealer if you can exchange the work in the future or can they can resell it if you later want to buy something else or something better by an artist build a relationship with the auction house it helps to have contacts introduce yourself to the representatives in your field of interest ideally you should know the people at the auction house as well as you know your favorite dealer observe listen learn and ask questions especially if you are there mainly for investment reasons talking to people can be key be prepared to question the artist s dealer or even the artist about the work itself remember a collector should be as passionate about the work as the artist which can require you to be very passionate indeed bear in mind the hidden costs the costs of restoration and framing can be costly and insurance is vital works on paper should be kept away from sunlight if the works are going to be on a wall it needs to be glazed according to museum standards with acid free matting and ultraviolet light resistance glass if the work is more than 10 years old then you should have an art conservator look at it before it is framed also remember that with art you are buying objects that have a life of their own if you maintain and look after your art you may one day be asked to loan them to an artist or museum over the art s lifetime you may find yourself dealing with museums and other institutions as a custodian of the historic artwork rather than simply as an owner avoid the biggest mistake a collector can make not being informed enough otherwise you may buy something that doesn t possess the depth a work of art should evoke or pass on something and later you realize that you should have bought it it is better to take chances but ensure that those chances are born of a genuine passion be warned that if you treat art like a commodity you will end up with stocks or certificates on your wall in other words you will potentially be surrounded by things that you don t like and don t want to live with equip yourself with a knowledge of art history the history of the markets and the current art scene it can also help to become a member of an art dealers association above all ensure that you amass a collection that you will love and can live with potentially for the rest of your life,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to buy abandoned storage units,when someone fails to pay the rent on a storage unit for three months straight the storage facility seizes the unit and its contents since sorting and selling the items in an abandoned unit is time intensive storage facilities simply auction the units off to random buyers you can find live auctions in your area and attend them in person or bid online through one of the popular auction sites keep in mind this is essentially a form of gambling while you may be able to make a lot of money on some of the units you buy many of them will cost you money if the items inside turn out to be worthless,contact storage facilities in your area to find out when they host auctions search online to find storage facilities in your area call each facility one by one and ask when they host their abandoned unit auctions after they give you the date and time ask how many units are being auctioned off most storage facilities host auctions on abandoned units every 1 6 months so jot the dates and times for each auction down and pick some auctions to attend 1 x research source generally speaking you will have more luck finding a deal if there are a lot of units being auctioned off if you have to choose between 2 auctions pick the auction with the highest number of available units facilities typically wait until they have 10 20 abandoned units to host auctions larger facilities may host auctions every 2 3 months while smaller facilities usually wait 4 5 months to host auctions the exception is when the storage facility runs out of available units and needs to free up some space these auctions are usually free although larger auctions may require a small entry fee set aside 3 4 hours for an auction and bring some cash most auctions take some time so block off 3 4 hours on your calendar for the event take out as much cash as you re comfortable spending at the auction the price of abandoned units can range from 25 5 000 so only take the cash that you re willing to spend 2 x research source most storage facilities only take cash payment for their units but it s still a good idea to only bid cash even if they accept credit cards or checks it s easy to get carried away when people start bidding and you get caught up in the moment but sticking with a budget will ensure that you don t overspend the prices for storage units fluctuate wildly based on what people are willing to gamble on on rare occasions the prices can exceed 5 000 this happens when a unit appears to contain rare collectibles or expensive electronics take a flashlight and phone with you to make appraisal easier you are typically not allowed to enter an abandoned storage unit or touch its contents this means that you ll need to rely on visual inspections from the edge of each unit s doorway since storage units are dark take a flashlight to see the items at the back more clearly bring a phone with you in case you need to look up the price of items in the unit before bidding starts 3 x research source for example if there is a box labelled beanie babies 1994 you can perform a quick online search with your phone to get an estimate for what the box is worth keep in mind the box may not contain what s on the label but you can get a hint about what may be in there and decide if it s worth the gamble bring some padlocks with you as well if you end up buying a storage unit you ll need locks to secure your unit until you can pick the items up show up on time and listen to the auctioneer s instructions go to the facility s main desk and ask where the auction is being held once everyone has shown up listen to the auctioneer s instructions regarding the format of the auction and the general rules these are different from facility to facility so listen carefully to avoid making illegal bids 4 x research source pay close attention to the fees and cleaning deposit instructions facilities typically charge fees on top of the final closing price most facilities also require a cleaning deposit of 50 100 to ensure that you clean the unit out after you remove the items this deposit is returned after you clean the units you buy go online to one of the popular storage auction sites and sign up there are 2 major auction sites for abandoned storage units storage auctions and storage treasures go to either of these sites and sign up for a buyer s account by entering your name address and credit card information 5 x research source these sites are free to join you only enter a credit card number to pay the auction site s fees when you buy a unit these fees are typically 10 15 a unit you can visit storage auctions at https storageauctions com and storage treasures at https www storagetreasures com search for units in your area using the site s search function go to each site and enter your location into the search bar at the top this will pull up a map of units being auctioned off in your area even though you re buying the unit online you still need to show up to the facility to pay for the unit and collect its contents so start by looking at the auctions closest to where you live 6 x research source any auction that is currently taking place will have a large timer on it ticking down to the end of the auction sort your search if you re looking for something specific while nobody knows what the entire contents of a storage unit the facility usually lists the type of goods that appear to be in the unit if you re looking to acquire or sell a particular item use the filter function on your search to weed out search results you aren t interested in 7 x research source you ll only be able to search and filter out items that are obvious from standing in the doorway of the unit for example furniture power tools and bags of clothes tend to be fairly obvious items just from a precursory glance inspect each unit to assess its contents a big unit with lots of items is not necessarily valuable and a small unit with a few boxes isn t necessarily worthless online inspect the photos carefully to assess them in person use your flashlight to check each section of the unit once the auctioneer opens the door look for labels on boxes and assess the shape of bags and boxes to determine what may be inside 8 x research source cheap items like toys old tvs broken furniture and clothes are generally not worth buying online you may not have much to go on since there are usually only 2 5 photos for each auction inspect the images carefully to look for hints about what may be hiding in the background pay attention to the smell of a room if you re attending an auction in person take a strong whiff of the unit from the doorway if the room smells like smoke rotted food or urine the items may need to be scrapped you won t be able to sell anything that has a permanent odor even if the goods in the unit would normally be expensive 9 x research source the opposite of this is equally true a room with no odor has likely been well taken care of and is more likely to have sellable goods inside you won t be able to do this if you re bidding online this is one of the reasons that online bids tend to be less competitive than live auctions in terms of bidding estimate the value of the room and keep it in mind once you inspect the contents of a room make an educated guess about what the contents may be worth in resale if there looks like there s at least 100 worth of goods in the room and you think you can make at least 75 selling them set your estimate at 50 keep this number in the back of your mind as you bid to set a limit for yourself 10 x research source for example if you think a room can get you roughly 75 in resale and you get outbid past your personal limit of 50 don t place another bid give up on the unit and try again with the next one this can be tricky to do if you re buying online and the photos aren t particularly good look for well kept units that appear to be carefully organized if there are ripped bags thrown all over the place and items appear to be tipped over the previous owner of the unit has likely already taken everything valuable and left the rest to be auctioned however the unit is more likely to have expensive items in them if boxes are beautifully organized bags are carefully stacked and everything looks like it was handled with care 11 x research source bid on a unit until you buy it or drop out of the bidding for in person auctions once everyone has inspected the unit bidding opens up respond to the auctioneer by announcing the price you re willing to buy the unit for once you re outbid the auctioneer will ask for the next bid level continue bidding until you purchase the unit or decide that it is no longer worth the asking price 12 x research source if you re bidding online simply press the place bid button the auction page to place your bid only bid on units that you re willing to purchase do not bid for the sake of bidding you may end up buying something you don t really want if this is your first time doing this bid conservatively and study how other people bid to get a sense for the process it s perfectly fine to skip bidding on a unit if it looks worthless pay for the units you buy and collect your goods for each bid that you win you ll pay the auctioneer as soon as the auction ends if you won the auction online drive to the storage facility and pay the clerk behind the desk you ll receive the keys to the unit or be asked to lock it yourself collect the items in the storage units you bought and return the unit to the facility you are typically given a 1 2 day grace period to collect your things 13 x research source this is a real pain if you don t have a truck if you have a large number of items rent a moving truck to take your new items be sure to sweep and clean the unit before returning it to the facility so that you can get your cleaning deposit back when it comes to larger storage units it is common practice for the winning bidder to rent the storage unit they bought for 1 month to give themselves time to find storage space or unload some of the goods sort through the goods after you purchase the unit start by going through every box purse and container to see if there are items inside then if you want to keep anything set it aside sort your items based on where you re going to sell them and throw out any damaged or worthless items this will give you a better sense for how you re going to go about making your money 14 x research source for example you may have one pile for a garage sale one pile for the scrap yard and one pile of goods that you re going to sell individually online have a place to store your goods while you work to sell them many people that buy abandoned units for a living rent a warehouse or large storage unit to store their goods for your first couple of buys feel free to store the goods in your home basement or garage while you work out where to sell the items 15 x research source you can always keep some of things you buy from the unit if you d like host a garage sale to get rid of a lot of everyday items one of the easiest ways to get rid of your things is to host a garage sale wash the clothes wipe down furniture and clean other objects set signs out all over your neighborhood listing the date and location of the sale post this information on social media as well on the day of the sale set your goods out in front of your home or open the garage door and sell to the people that show up 16 x research source this is the best option for getting rid of items that people use regularly but don t have a high resale price this includes clothing kitchenware exercise equipment and holiday decorations list larger items in decent condition for sale online selling online is the best way to make money on items that may fetch a higher price like power tools cameras furniture and sporting equipment take high quality photos of your goods and list them on ebay craigslist and facebook marketplace wait for interested parties to contact you and meet with them to sell them your goods 17 x research source take specialty items and collectibles to shops that buy them if you have unique items collectibles or jewelry take them to a shop that specializes in these goods and sell them for example if you have a box of vinyl records take them to a music shop video games can be taken to a game store and comic books can be sold to comic shops 18 x research source take jewelry to get appraised before selling it you never know if you have something truly special on your hands sell broken or worthless items to scrap yards or throw them out anything that can be turned into scrap metal like broken washing machines or bed frames can be sold for scrap at a scrap yard for a small profit find a scrap yard near you and haul your things over to sell them for a few bucks any other broken or worthless items are simply going to take up space donate what you can to local charities and throw the rest of it out 19 x research source a lot of the items that you get from storage units aren t going to be worth anything these items are only going to take up space in your storage area so don t waste your time trying to sell them,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to run a silent auction,silent auctions are auctions held without an auctioneer people place their bids on sheets of paper instead they re often used by charities to raise money but they can be tricky to put together with good planning however it s easy to set up an auction and get the most out of your items soon enough you ll have raised a good amount of money in just a few hours,recruit volunteers a contact list especially an email list is handy for this you will need volunteers to help set up volunteers to monitor and close tables at the appointed time and make sure minimum bid and minimum increase requirements were met a bank crew to organize bid sheets especially of multiple winners and collect money from winning bids and a clean up crew select volunteers willing to be officials these people will need to know the rules of the silent auction and who to go to for questions they can t answer during the event they will wear something hat vests jackets or sashes that designates them as officials ask for donations to make money for your charity you ll need items or services to sell at the silent auction many businesses and even individuals within your community will likely be happy to help if you tell them what the purpose of the auction is and who will benefit from it don t forget to ask for services as well as tangible goods perhaps a local salon will donate a haircut and or style or a local golf course could offer a round of golf with a trainer make a master list of the value of all the items if you are going to do this again next year it is nice to have the same people go to the same businesses each year include space on your master list to write who donated the item the value of it the donor s contact information who won the item their phone number and how much they paid this way you can make sure they get their items and you know how much money you made when making a master list consider using a computerized program such as excel another volunteer might be willing to input the information if so make columns for donor name address and phone number item number item description and value put a number on each item use small blank stickers or labels available at general stores and office supply businesses if you have more than a few items and if any of them are similar it makes keeping track much easier put the same number next to the item on your master list 1 x research source put the item number on the bid sheet as well so bidders can match the bid sheet to the item make a list of supplies you think you ll need and go shopping you ll need clipboards paper and pens at minimum also purchase some whiteout tape extra bid sheets and an extra roll of tape to tape your bid sheets down if you aren t using clipboards try to buy supplies at a warehouse store with a generous return policy if the store requires a membership keep that in mind when sending someone on a run for last minute supplies and make sure that person has a cell phone and that a key person at the event has that number after they have left for a supplies run you ll surely find something else that needs to be picked up if you don t already have one you ll also need a secure cash box if you plan to take credit cards which is a very good idea get a card reader services such as square offer readers that attach to tablets and smartphones print bidding sheets write the name of the item a short description of the item how much it is worth and who donated it include a minimum bid generally 40 of the retail value and minimum bid increase increments one rule of thumb for minimum increase 1 for items up to 50 2 for 50 100 5 for items over 100 make sure there is space for the bidder s name phone number and the amount they bid if you like add a buy it now price to each bid sheet in case someone wants to leave before the end of the auction 2 x research source have a volunteer make up certificates for services if the donated service didn t come with a gift certificate you can print up your own you can also use your own certificates for gift certificates with small print that are hard to read start setting up early try to set up a day before the event you ll need extra time not only to set up but to allow for any mistakes if you can set up a day or two before the auction so you don t have to stress about it consider designating someone who is willing to go to the store to buy forgotten items 3 x research source lay out all the items and the bid sheets so people can see them if you have a lot of items you may have to be pretty creative for example some things might be better hung on walls or placed on display easels don t worry if the bid sheet isn t right next to the item just make it close that s what the numbers are for 4 x research source secure the bid sheets it s easy for bid sheets to get blown or knocked around the best way to secure them is to clip each bid sheet to a clipboard with an attached pen this is an easy and convenient setup 5 x research source you can also use painter s tape to secure the bid sheets have volunteers monitor the tables monitors will help make sure bid sheets are staying in place and people are following the minimum bid and minimum increase rules people will probably have questions about some items so try to prepare the volunteers to answer them give people plenty of warning as closing time approaches make announcements at least 10 and 5 minutes before if you have one closing announce it loudly and clearly if you have interval closing times announce loudly and clearly which closing it is people will want to bid right up to the very end end at that time choose one person s watch to use and put them in charge of the time since everyone s watch is different collect the bid sheets and pens once bidding is over have the volunteers quickly pick up all the pens and sheets so no one can be sneaky and try to slip in a late bid volunteers need to circle the winning bid and draw a line through the empty spaces of the bid sheets so no one can add their name after the closing time if you have many items consider closing the tables at intervals such as every 15 minutes doing so helps keep the volunteers from being overwhelmed at table closing time 6 x research source check to make sure the winning bids have followed the minimum bid and minimum increase rules if a minimum bid was not met set that sheet aside organizers can decide later how to deal with it if a minimum increase was not met select the most recent high bidder above the minimum bid who did meet the minimum bid the volunteers then take the bid sheets to the bank 7 x research source have bank volunteers sort the sheets it s easy to sort by last name in alphabetical order if anyone has won more than one item a common occurrence staple those sheets together that way you only need to have them pay once if you have just a few items you can call people s names and have them come get their stuff cordon off the bank area and ask everyone to wait if your bidders are able to take their items home with them after the auction ask them to wait while the bids are verified it s helpful to have a game or other entertainment available to keep bidders from getting bored 8 x research source call people to the bank when the bankers are ready either call bidders up one at a time by name or just have them form a line if you are using the latter method the bankers will have to search through the bid sheets for the bidder s name so it s important that the bid sheets are alphabetized set aside bid sheets for people who don t come to the bank if someone has won one or more items and doesn t appear on their own set those bid sheets aside when you re just about done with the people in line have the emcee announce their names in case they are still at the event if the bidder still doesn t appear note it on the bid sheet you can arrange an alternate pickup or give the item to the next highest bidder depending on the rules you established have a volunteer collect the items as people pay you could send people to collect their own items but silent auctions often attract people who want a good deal and might not particularly support the cause for which you are raising money most people are very honest but one bad apple can really spoil the event for others deal with the leftover items after the line of people is gone you will probably have things left over these people went home didn t know they won or whatever that s why you have their phone number on the bid sheet if you can t leave the items at the event location you will probably have to take them home make sure you or a volunteer has the bid sheets with the phone numbers for items that met the minimum bid but weren t picked up you or a volunteer will need to call the bidder sort out all the bid sheets that go to the same person they may have bought one thing or twenty add up their total and call to tell them they have won ask if they could please come get their things you may have to be flexible about arranging a time to meet them if you have lots left over divide up the pile so no one has to call 20 people this part can be a big hassle so divvy the work to make it easier prepare for derelict bidders undoubtedly there will be people who don t want to pay for the things they bid on call the next person on the bid sheet and see if they still want it count the money and checks before going to the bank bank tellers can make mistakes look for checks that are made out improperly the bank may still accept them but you should be aware of them give thanks and recognition to those who donated and bought if you have volunteers on your email contact list send out an email thank you and let them know how successful the event was send a personalized thank you to vendors and businesses who donated goods and services contact any newspaper columnists or radio disc jockeys who promoted your event to thank them and let them know it was a success write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper thanking people who helped if the winning bid was more than the value of the item the person may want need a tax deductible receipt for the amount donated over the value along with the thank you 9 x research source if your organization has a business office or accounting department you may want to ask them about tax implications of the items in the auction and if a tax needs to be deducted from the bid amount this is why complete documentation of the source of the item the description and the item s value is so important,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to buy police impounded cars,if you re looking to save money on your next car purchase you may consider buying an impounded car from a police auction impounded cars are vehicles that have been seized by law enforcement officials due to a crime varying from driving without a license to driving while intoxicated to being involved in criminal activity 1 x research source these cars can be sold at government auctions that are open to the public for a fraction of their value and you may walk away with a good deal on a car but you should do the necessary preparatory work before you attend the auction inspect the car at the auction before you buy it and take the necessary steps before you drive it home to ensure your purchase from the impound auction ends up being worth your time and money,look for auctions held in less popular or crowded areas like any auction the more crowded it is the more competition you may have a big crowd could drive the bidding prices up or cause you to lose out on a bid for a vehicle look for auctions that are situated in less populated areas or tend to fly under the radar 2 x research source you can search for police auctions in certain areas online focus on auctions outside of a major city if possible or in a smaller town or city as these may be less crowded than auctions held in larger cities or known areas research the vehicles listed online a few days before the auction date most auctions will list the vehicles that will be available at the auction a few days before the auction date look over each listing and identify which vehicles you are interested in bidding on you should try to choose at least one to two vehicles in the event you lose out on a bid so you have a backup vehicle you can still bid on 3 x research source if you have your eye on a mercedes benz clk listed online for example you should note the details listed for the car then you should research the market value of a used mercedes benz clk and determine how much you would be willing to bid for the car make sure you are clear on the maximum you would be willing to spend on the car as this can prevent you from overbidding in the chaos of the auction bring cash or proof of an approved loan to the auction police auctions will only take payment in cash or proof of an approved loan for the winning bid if you are planning to pay with an approved loan from your bank you will need to be able to cover a minimum deposit for the full cost of the vehicle 4 x research source you will also need to cover the cost of taxes title and registration fees cars sold at auction do not come with a warranty and are considered as is so you will likely need to purchase insurance and a warranty for the car once you buy it you will also need enough money to cover the cost of towing the car from the auction and the cost of cutting new keys for the vehicle if it is sold without keys take a set of tools car oil and an air pressure gauge you will not be able to drive the vehicles before you bid on them so inspecting the car beforehand with tools car oil and an air pressure gauge can help to ensure the car is in working order 5 x research source show up early and check in the vehicles at a police auction are often shown in a set order so get to the auction early and check in with the auction you can get a copy of the showing list at check in and have a chance to inspect the vehicles you are interested in before the auction starts 6 x research source inspect the vehicles you are interested in bidding on use your set of tools to do a quick inspection of the vehicles you plan to bid on the vehicles appear at the auction untouched which means they are in the exact state they were in when they were confiscated by the police be prepared for the vehicles to be filthy damaged or full of someone else s stuff 7 x research source do not be put off by surface level dirt or strong smells as these can be cleaned out as long the vehicle s parts are in good shape 8 x research source lift the hood of the vehicle and give it a good inspection look at the brakes the shocks and the quality of the tires on the vehicle this will help you determine if the vehicle is worth bidding on and how much you should bid for the vehicle do not bid more than you can afford it can be easy to get caught up in the chaos of bidding wars and quick sales at the auction so focus on staying calm and not bidding more than you can afford remember your predetermined limit you set for yourself as you bid on the vehicles you are interested in and try not to overbid in an attempt to outbid someone else avoid making quick in the heat of the moment decisions and really be certain you want a vehicle before you start bidding on it you don t want to end up having to pay more for a vehicle than you can afford or than it s worth because you got caught up in a bidding war check if there is a towing company on site depending on the condition of the car you bought at

and 24 karats represent 100 purity this makes them more expensive however lower karat gold is more long lasting and therefore would be best for regular or everyday use 1 x research source the weight of gems is measured by carats and more carats in a jewelry item signals a higher price when it comes to the more expensive natural gemstones how they are treated will also have a significant impact on their market price untreated sapphires and emeralds for example are far more expensive than their treated counterparts 2 x research source when buying diamonds you will need to consider clarity carat cut and color which will all affect their value for example white diamonds with a color grading of d are more expensive as they are purer and colorless than the rest and the colored diamonds like reds pinks and blues are highly valued due to their rarity 3 x research source and when it comes to pearls natural pearls can be 10 times more valuable than cultured ones the luster shape size and color also affect the value of pearl jewelry 4 x trustworthy source gemological institute of america nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards go to source determine the type of jewelry you would like to purchase unlike a jewelry store you will not be able to find a wide variety of pieces at a seized asset auction therefore

the process and visit a few of their auctions first this will help you to familiarize yourself with their auction process you will also be able to meet and network with auction goers who regularly attend their events and get some useful insights shortlist products from the auction catalogs seized asset auction schedules are often announced on the auction house websites and sometimes are even advertised you can also sign up for their newsletters so you are automatically alerted of scheduled auctions browse their product catalogs to check the inventory that will be auctioned these are often available online or you could get them by directly contacting the auction house go through the product inventories and shortlist what matches your requirement check product descriptions and contact the auction house if you want more information also spend adequate time researching specific qualities and details of the pieces so you can get an idea of their market value check how and when they are appraised look for certificates of authenticity and quality that are issued recently after all what you purchase at seized asset auctions cannot be returned so check and double check to ensure

additional costs that you could incur auction houses charge a buyers premium which is usually a percentage of the winning bid this could change based on the item and auction type so check the buyers premium charged for the products you are interested in inquire about any other fees such as taxes that could apply check on accepted payment methods so you can prepare ahead of time these can vary from cash to credit card payments decide your maximum bid for each item based on your research and evaluations decide on the maximum price you re prepared to pay for each item you ve shortlisted in

valuable over time factor in additional fees you will need to pay such as the buyers premium your pre allocated budget will also affect the maximum bid levels go early and register bidding at an auction needs to be done with a calm mind so you can observe the atmosphere and clearly gauge the pulse to help bid effectively so always enter a seized asset auction as early as possible this will give you enough time to settle in before the bidding begins you will also have time to preview the items clarify details and network with others without feeling rushed carry your id which is required for registration and be sure to collect your bidding number this is a unique number assigned to each bidder so that the auctioneer could easily identify participants preview the items make ample use of the assigned preview time to examine the items you have shortlisted from the catalogs evaluate their quality to your best ability and carefully check for any visible defects speak to the auction house experts and clarify any questions you may have remember that the information they could reveal about previous owners and history is often limited at seized asset auctions since these are confiscated items nevertheless there s no harm in asking check certifications of appraisals and other inspection reports by the auction house never purchase high value jewelry without checking these documents if possible bring someone with a sound knowledge about appraising fine jewelry they can help verify its quality and the information provided by the auction house inquire about the delivery process seized asset auctions prefer to process payments and clear out the inventory as soon as possible so if you win a jewelry item you can often take it home straight after the auction once the official documentation processing is done bid when you enter the auction room select a seat where you can observe the rest of the bidders it s also important for you to clearly see the items auctioned and ensure that you are visible to the auctioneer as well wait for the lot you have shortlisted to be brought forward and start bidding many auction houses would give you a paddle with a bidding number raise this whenever you want to place a bid and ensure that the auctioneer has seen you each auction will have a bidding increment amount to outbid others so find this out ahead of time once you have been outbid the auctioneer will naturally look at you to check whether you are willing to offer a counter bid you can continue bidding until you reach the maximum bid limit you had set earlier if you re the highest bidder then you ve won pay and take the item home once you ve outbid others the auctioneer and the auction house staff will note down your bidding number and the hammer price which is the last bid you ve placed to win the item each live auction will have its own preferred payment methods which often include cash and credit cards cards will require an id for verification purposes you can pay at the end of the auction or right after you ve won the item if you want to leave early after making the payment you can simply take the item home most auction houses will offer local delivery or shipping services at a fee these services are useful for larger items or if you re bidding over the phone,Hobbies-and-Crafts

terms and conditions you may want to contact the agency or contractor in charge of the auction in most cases it s easier to only use one method of payment but you may be allowed to spread the amount out for example by using two credit cards if you do not make payment in full by the deadline you are considered to be in default inability to pay your winning bid is considered a breach of contract and you may be liable for significant liquidated damages arrange for removal of the property in most cases once you ve paid for an item you must remove it from the auction lot or government location

how to run a business to business online auction,this article addresses the business to business online auction approach for auction values in excess of a quarter of a million dollars or pounds,the first step is to pick your category to take to auction this can be a daunting task owing to the complexity the average business faces in their purchased goods and services aim for categories that can be clearly defined and specified that are likely to attract the interest of bidders and that have a sufficient number of bidders in the market ideally you would have at least three motivated and capable bidders taking part in your auction once you have chosen a category the next step is to define it and all the items contained within it generally e auction software allows you to upload drawings specifications photos brochures and any other file that can help to clarify what exactly it is that you are looking to buy or sell depending on whether it is a forward or reverse auction that you wish to run the third step is to find and engage the bidders to take part in your auction this is known as the sourcing exercise cast your net far and wide to make sure you find the best bidders in the market speak to each bidder in person if time allows as this will give you a chance to establish a relationship and gain an understanding on how you can mutually benefit each other beyond just a question of price at this stage you may wish to obtain qualification prices this allows you to gain an understanding of any discrepancies in the information you gave them by seeing if certain submitted prices are wildly different it will also enable you to get a provisional understanding of which bidders are in the right ball park and which are either much too expensive or much too cheap in which case you may wish to have further conversations with them with perhaps a view to eliminate them from the auction the final advantage of using this qualification price stage is to assess whether any items that you have included should be removed from the auction for example if no one has bid for them or if the only bids you have received are not competitive now that you have defined what it is that you are taking to auction have established who your bidders are and made sure that they are all motivated and keen to take part and confirmed that the items you are taking to auction have received competitive quotes then you are ready for the auction itself right before the actual auction you may wish to take your bidders through a training exercise on perhaps a test auction to make sure they know how to bid and to confirm with them exactly what it is that they are bidding for the final step is to run the auction most e auction software allows you to monitor your bidders and who is presently logged on any absent bidders should be chased up by telephone to ensure they are able to take part the auction itself would most commonly be set for a 30 minute duration with the ability to auto extend should a bid be placed in the last few minutes make sure you are present throughout to answer any questions that may be posted during the auction once the auction is completed be sure to thank all your bidders for their time and commitment to your request and reassure them that you shall give them the feedback that they deserve,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to clean and preserve sand dollars,collecting sand dollars on the beach can be a fun and exciting activity but they often look dull from all their time spent in the salty ocean water learn how to carefully clean and preserve these delicate treasures and turn them into interesting decorations or gifts,choose your sand dollars carefully don t collect living sand dollars it s considered inhumane and illegal in some places to kill sand dollars for the express purpose of drying them out and using them as decoration 1 x research source always be conscious of the amount of shells you take and do your part to preserve the sand dollar species by leaving living creatures in the ocean or tossing them back if they have mistakenly washed up on shore sand dollars that have washed up on shore and are whitish or pale in color are most likely dead these are the ones you want to collect never dig sand dollars from the ocean floor sand dollars burrow beneath the sand of the sea floor to protect themselves from predators and debris if you dig up a sand dollar underwater there s a good chance that it s alive check them before you take them gently turn the sand dollar over and look for tiny centipede like feet or hairs on its bottom side brush the hairs with your hand if the hairs move the sand dollar is alive place it gently back into the ocean if the hairs don t move feel free to take the sand dollar home 2 x research source if a sand dollar is moist or solid in your hand there s a good chance that it s alive or recently deceased even if you found it washed up on the beach exercise your best judgment and consider returning a sand dollar to the sea if you aren t sure 3 x research source collect the dried out exoskeletons that wash up on the beach these empty shells called tests may be difficult to find which makes them even more precious and meaningful in many states it s illegal to collect living sand dollars and you may face a fine if you re caught in the act 4 x research source if you re not sure about the law or if you care about preserving fragile littoral ecosystems don t take sand dollars directly from the ocean many beaches and coastal authorities restrict the number of sand dollars that you can collect in one day research local beach combing rules and restrictions before you set out for the day before you take a shell from the ocean make sure no organism is still living inside it the ocean is a delicate ecosystem and can be dramatically disturbed by over picking even if you only take a few shells 5 x research source soak the sand dollars in fresh water your freshly collected sand dollar shells might have a slight marine odor which can be caused by small organisms and algae living on the shell fill a bucket with clean fresh water and submerge your sand dollar shells inside allow them to soak the water in the bucket may become discolored or start to smell bad if this happens retrieve your shells from the bucket dump out the water and fill the bucket with clean fresh water replace your shells and soak them again continue to soak the shells until they no longer cause the water to discolor soaking your shells in fresh water after collecting them helps to prevent decay gently brush the shells optional during the soaking process you may see small pieces of debris stuck in the crevices of the shells in this case use a soft toothbrush to gently dislodge and debris avoid brushing the shells aggressively these shells are very delicate and vigorous brushing can cause them to crack you can also use a toothpick to gently pick at spots of debris soaking your shell for a longer period will help loosen pieces of debris soak your shells in bleach once your shells are completely clean take them out of the fresh water and lay them on a towel to dry while you prepare a solution of half fresh water and half bleach soak your sand dollars in the solution set a timer and only allow your sand dollars to soak in the bleach for 10 minutes or less soaking your shells for longer can cause the shells to disintegrate 6 x research source if you re cleaning a number of sand dollars fill a baking tray with the bleach and water solution this will allow you to spread a number of sand dollars evenly over a broad surface make sure that there s enough solution in the tray to cover the entire sand dollar you can also use a bowl a bucket or a tupperware container if you re only cleaning one sand dollar find a small bowl lid or another container you won t need much bleach to get the intended effect rinse the shells remove your shells from your bleach solution using rubber gloves or metal tongs and rinse them under fresh water rinse all sides and crevices of the shells completely to wash all of the bleach off let your shells dry once you have soaked your shells and rinsed them clean of bleach lay them onto a towel to dry for the best results lay your shells in the sun this allows them to easily air dry prepare your solution use equal parts water and equal parts school glue to create a watered down mixture line a small bowl with plastic wrap or wax paper to protect the surface of the bowl and mix your solution with a disposable utensil mix as much solution as you think you ll need depending on the size and amount of sand dollar shells you have lay your shells on wax paper like a baking sheet or large plate with wax paper and lay your dry shells on it place your shells with the rounded side facing up make sure to space your shells an inch or so apart using wax paper allows for an easy clean up paint glue on your sand dollar use a soft paintbrush to paint the rounded top side of your shells first try to avoid touching the shell with your fingers this can leave smudges in the glue allow the glue to completely dry before flipping the shells over and painting the underside painting your shells with this glue mixture will harden the shells which will help them last longer maintain a clean work area to ensure dirt and debris don t get stuck to the sand dollars this method will create a dull natural finish for your sand dollars make christmas ornaments use paint fabric and cotton balls to turn

how to find shark teeth,finding shark teeth can be a fun easy activity to do when you re at an ocean beach you just need to know where to look and how to identify a shark tooth when you see one you can keep teeth as souvenirs or string them on a necklace and wear them,learn about shark migration patterns sharks migrate to and from different areas depending on the time of year some areas have lots of shark teeth because large numbers of sharks travel around the shores often for example sandbar sharks are found in large numbers off the east coast of florida in spring when they mate they move north at the end of summer and have their pups so areas like delaware bay have a large population towards the early fall 1 x research source find a beach look up shark populated areas and select a beach to search for teeth sharks live in salt water only except bull sharks who swim up into freshwater rivers that connect to the ocean so don t go looking in your local pond sharks are more common in hot humid places such as hawaii and florida although they can also be found at the poles many coastal regions of states near the ocean like california florida hawaii virginia carolina and alabama were once underwater you can sometimes even find shark teeth fossils in these areas on dry land or in river beds since large portions of the state were submerged sharks were often drawn to these shallow waters to seek food 2 x research source go after a storm big storms can bring in all sorts of debris from the ocean including shark teeth 3 x research source there will also be fewer visitors on the beach on days when the weather is less than ideal start early go in the morning when there are fewer people in the water the calmer waters will make it easier to see any shark teeth weekdays are usually a less popular beach time so go then if possible to avoid the crowds be prepared you won t find a shark tooth in five minutes be prepared to stay at the beach for a couple of hours bring sunscreen and some water to stay there properly without harm you may also want to pack a picnic lunch ask locals to help you find the best spot people may be able to tell you about shark tooth hot spots or places where they commonly found teeth if you aren t from the area a local may be able to tell you which beaches draw crowds and when and which ones have a lot of teeth you can improve your chances of finding teeth right away if you find someone that can point you in the right direction get a permit if necessary depending on what state or country you are looking for shark teeth in you may need to get a permit before searching for fossils in some areas permits aren t necessary for shark teeth but you never know what else you might find learn what shark teeth look like shark teeth have a pointy top and a thin body most teeth along the beach or shoreline are 1 8 to 3 4 but you can often locate larger teeth further out in the ocean some teeth look like a triangle without a top some are more y shaped identification can sometimes be difficult because the tooth characteristics can change depending on the location of the tooth in the jaw and the age or sex of the shark 4 x research source look for the color black many fossilized shark teeth are black these are what you are most likely to find along the beach other less common colors of shark teeth are gray or brown modern shark teeth are usually white in color on the tooth and the root they are seldom found along the shoreline 5 x research source remember everything you find that is triangular isn t a shark tooth they could be rocks or stones so be sure that you know the looks of a tooth look for any souvenir shops near the beach they may have some shark teeth for sale so you can see an example of what you are searching for scan along the shore and in the shallow waters shark teeth can often be found in easily on top of the loose sediment it might be hard to spot among the shells and pebbles if you just look on top of the sand you might not have a lot of luck scoop up some sand near the water s edge if you do not spot any teeth on the surface you will need to start digging bring some tools you might want a shovel trowel or bucket you will probably want something to sift sand with like a colander or strainer 6 x research source dig in a place where sand is unusually elevated teeth won t always be on the surface sand constantly covers up old sand with new sand don t be afraid to get your hands dirty search in the water if you aren t having much luck on the beach try moving out into the shallows bring your strainer and reach down below the surface and scoop up some sediment sift through the sediment to see what you find while shark teeth are the big catch keep an eye out for other cool items like stingray porpoise or crocodile teeth you might find some cool shells too consider renting some scuba diving equipment you can search more terrain off the shoreline when you go diving and you might find some larger older shark teeth by searching a little further from the beach be patient don t just glance at an area of sand and move on finding sharks teeth usually takes a bit of time and persistence waves may bring in new teeth so it is a good idea to check areas multiple times a single shark can produce up to 25 000 teeth over a lifetime so there are plenty of them out there to be found 7 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to clean oyster shells for crafts,crafting with oyster shells is a fun way to create unique gifts and one of a kind beachy decor before crafting with oyster shells it s helpful to clean them so they ll look bright and polished to get your oyster shells ready for crafting start by sanitizing them to kill bacteria and loosen any surface grim or residue then you can scrub off the stuck on particles and dry them in the sun so they ll be clean and smooth,shuck the oysters if they re fresh with the oyster still inside if the oyster is still closed place it on a nonslip surface and press down on the top with your other hand wedge the end of a shucking knife into the space where the top and bottom shells meet twist the knife to pop the shells apart then use the sharp edge of the knife to cut under the meaty part of the oyster to separate it from the shell 1 x research source the meaty part of the oyster is attached to the shell by its membrane cutting under the oyster with a sharp knife will cut through the membrane allowing the oyster to slide out of the shell you can discard the oyster in the trash or eat it raw immediately after opening the shell you may want to wear protective gloves to protect your hands from the knife and the shell s sharp edges rinse the shells with water to remove any surface muck or sand rinse the oyster shells under running water in your sink or preferably outside with a hose this removes some of the loose sand and mud allowing the bleach to sanitize the shells more effectively 2 x research source rinsing the oyster shells in the sink may leave a lingering smell to avoid this rinse them outside with a hose place the rinsed shells in a large bucket transfer each of the shells into the bucket one by one as you finish rinsing them off stack them in the bottom of the bucket carefully so you don t crack the shells while you can use your sink or tub instead of a bucket the oyster shells may leave a lingering odor in addition any residue that comes off the shells will go into your drain pipes and could be harmful to the plumbing 3 x research source fill the bucket with equal parts bleach and water first pour enough bleach to cover all the shells into a clean bucket then add the same amount of water to the bucket to dilute the bleach 4 x research source diluting the bleach allows you to sanitize the oyster shells without damaging them the amount of bleach and water you ll need will vary depending on how many shells you re cleaning if you re sensitive to bleach or prefer not to use it you can use the same amount of white vinegar instead 5 x research source soak the oyster shells in the bleach solution for at least 1 hour this gives the bleach enough time to sanitize the shells and loosen the particles and residue 6 x research source you can safely leave them in the solution for up to 24 hours if you aren t using them immediately 7 x research source leaving them in the bleach for too long could cause the shells to start to degrade drain the bleach solution leaving the oysters inside the bucket carefully pour the bleach solution out of the bucket 8 x research source you can use a colander to keep the oysters inside or pour them out with the solution and place them back in after the bucket is empty if you re handling the oysters you may want to wear gloves to protect your hands from the bleach and sharp edges refill the bucket to the brim with dish soap and warm water first squirt a quarter sized amount of dish soap into the bucket with the shells then refill the bucket with just enough water to cover the shells 9 x research source the water should get sudsy as you fill it up if it doesn t swish it around a bit to mix up the soap the dish soap will help loosen more of the stuck on particles and make it easier for you to clean and polish the shells so they re ready for crafting scrub the insides and outsides of the shells with a hard bristle brush first dip a hard bristle nylon brush or toothbrush into the soapy water then scrub both the inside and outside of the shells one at a time to remove any stuck on dirt membranes or barnacles 10 x research source repeat this process until you ve scrubbed the inside and outside of all of the shells if any of the stuck on particles are particularly stubborn you can use a craft knife or shucking knife to scrape them off 11 x research source you may want to wear a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from the oyster shell s sharp particles and edges rinse the oyster shells with clean water once you ve scrubbed all the shells remove them one by one from the bucket and rinse them with clean water as you work your way through the bucket place each of the oyster shells on a towel to dry 12 x research source instead of rinsing the shells under running water you can also transfer them into a bucket with clean water and let them soak for a few hours 13 x research source leave the shells on a towel to dry completely in the sun spread the oyster shells out on the towel with the insides facing down then leave them out to dry completely preferably in the sun so they ll dry quicker 14 x research source while you can also let the shells dry indoors the sun will help brighten and whiten the shells rub the oysters shells with baby oil to give them a shiny finish if you want to give your sanitized and polished oyster shells a bit of a sheen use a cloth to rub over the inside and outside with a thin layer of baby oil 15 x research source a little oil will go a long way so you ll likely only need a dime sized drop for every 1 or 2 shells you can also use mineral oil to give the shells a shiny coating let the oil dry completely before you start crafting with your oyster shells,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to collect sea or beach glass,collecting sea glass can be an incredibly relaxing activity walking down the beach of an ocean or lake will clear your mind of your everyday problems as you search for the treasured glass sea glass started as normal glass usually from bottles but after being tossed around in the waves for at least several years it emerges smooth polished and frosted making it a valuable item for collectors to collect sea glass you need to choose a good time and location to go know what to look for and find good uses for it 1 x research source,find a beach with rocks sea glass accumulates where rocks gravel are more abundant look for a beach with many pebbles and you will likely find sea glass there the same forces of nature wind waves and sand that break up small rocks also create sea glass 2 x research source look for a populated area the best places to find glass are beaches close to a city or industrial commercial zone sea glass starts out essentially as litter so you want areas that are currently settled or have been in the past this also goes for areas with lots of traffic in the sea because sea glass can come from shipwrecks or even war zones which will produce a lot of waste 3 x research source most sea glass started as a simple glass bottle it begins as a manmade item before the sea polishes it into sea glass therefore you need areas that have had bottles thrown in the water 4 x research source find a beach with big waves a turbulent surf is needed to create sea glass areas that are regularly hit with heavy waves and winds are the best conditions to create the sea glass the water acts as a giant rock tumbler by churning ordinary glass over time until it is polished the bigger the waves the better rough conditions will also help you to find the sea glass by moving it onto the shore go between autumn and spring this is when the sea is likely to be the most rough 5 x research source go at low tide this will give you the best chance to find sea glass so that you can look in all areas of the beach you can also go about an hour before or after low tide as the tide is moving which is likely to churn up sea glass 6 x research source during a full moon tides will be stronger this is helpful for the water to move the sea glass onto the shore 7 x research source go after a storm a storm will move the sea glass onto the shore hurricanes have been especially effective in moving large quantities of sea glass so that you can find it easily don t go looking for sea glass during a storm though wait until it s over 8 x research source visit a beach known for sea glass certain beaches have a reputation for having large quantities of sea glass these are a good place to start fort bragg in california has glass beach which was once a dump and now has great amounts of sea glass kauai island in hawaii has a nearby lava network that traps and polishes the glass bermuda has great sea glass from shipwrecks hurricanes and bottles thrown in the water puerto rico s vieques is also known for sea glass 9 x research source with a location where there will likely be many people looking for sea glass try to get there early to avoid competition look for frosted smooth pieces of glass you are looking for glass that has been ground and polished by sand rock and water erosion over many years to form an irregular shape with a dull color if the piece you find doesn t conform to these standards it is too new to be considered sea glass simply throw it back into the water distinguish between glass and sea glass it takes at least 7 10 years for a piece of glass to become sea glass if you ve found a piece that has jagged edges and shiny spots that s still glass sea glass on the other hand is well frosted and has smooth edges from being churned by waves over time 10 x research source find the colors that you prefer the most common colors are clear white green and brown less common colors are sky blue blue and indigo rare colors are red yellow amber orange and pink be aware that very tiny pieces of brown glass may look orange or amber it is almost impossible to find true black sea glass although dark colored sea glass may appear black the rarer the color the more valuable it will be if you want to sell it later 11 x research source the best glass comes from old bottles which are thicker and of bolder colors the brighter colors come from wine cooler bottles which look pretty but are very thin the new abundance of blue glass is credited to the popularity of skyy vodka green brown and clear are beer bottle colors use a small rake or stick to find more some people move rocks and sand around with a stick or rake having a small tool will help you to sort through all of the materials on the beach more quickly than with only your hands it will also keep your hands from getting as dirty 12 x research source look around low and high tide lines areas of wet sand are probably the best area to look in but be aware that certain colors of glass like white for example turn almost invisible when wet this is a good place to find green or blue glass dry sand close to the wet sand is a great place to find white and brown colors also the evasive red becomes more visible here 13 x research source some glass is easier to find wet while other colors are easier when dry green is easy to find wet or dry white is easier when dry brown is easier when wet blue can be found wet or dry but may look almost black when dry red is easier to find when dry amber is easier when wet black is always difficult to find look away from the shore dry sand far from the shore can also contain sea glass it has the added benefit that not as many people look here you would be amazed by the amount of glass you can find where most people are not looking for it look for a pocket of rocks walk along the beach looking for pockets of gravel squat or sit down take your time the trick is to select a small area and scan with your eyes collect the glass move to the next promising area face away from the sun so that the sun is hitting the sea glass this will help make the sea glass more visible to you and will also keep the sun from obstructing your view the sea glass will reflect light and glisten in the sun 14 x research source place pieces you choose to keep in a small bag or in your pockets if you are only gathering a few pieces you can keep them in your pockets if you wish to collect a lot bring a couple of small bags and fill them as you go consult a book for specifics on your pieces of glass once you have collected a lot you might not be sure which pieces are most valuable a good book such as pure sea glass by richard lamotte will help you to learn the specifics of your glass including its origin 15 x research source make sea glass jewelry popular jewelry items of sea glass include rings necklaces and earrings you can glue the sea glass onto a ring band or earring studs try using a hot glue gun to adhere the sea glass securely you could even drill holes in it to loop it through a chain or glue it to a pendant sea glass jewelry is elegant and beautiful and you can also sell it 16 x research source add sea glass to common items for embellishment you can adorn many items around your house with sea glass glue it onto a mirror candle holder or drawer handle try making a sea glass border around a picture frame sea glass is great for all kinds of arts and crafts you could even make a sea glass wind chime by hanging it on threads 17 x research source include your kids in this they will enjoy not only finding sea glass but also making crafts with it help them glue it to a picture they draw to add decoration display sea glass artistically if you collect a lot of sea glass you can display it artfully in a clear vase lamp base or bowl you could choose one color of sea glass for a uniform look or make a multicolored display sea glass is a beautiful decorative item that looks expensive even though you can get it for free 18 x research source you could even place sea glass at the bottom of a fish tank it will add color and visual interest to the tank sell it for profit sea glass is well sought after and people are willing to pay for it rare colors such as red dark blue and orange will likely generate a higher profit up to around 30 for a piece compared to around 5 for more common colors like white green and brown shape is another factor and some shapes like hearts and triangles are popular for making jewelry you can make up to 15 hour by searching for sea glass and then selling it on websites like ebay or etsy 19 x research source to help sell it take quality pictures of it in good lighting try to eliminate any shadows or other distractions to the

how to paint sand dollars,sand dollars are a flat species of sea urchin that regularly wash up on shore and can be painted to create awesome trinkets if you are getting fresh sand dollars from the beach you ll have to clean and prepare them before they are ready for paint once they are clean you can use watercolor or acrylic paint to create your design if you use your imagination and follow the right steps you can create a piece of art on a sand dollar,submerge the sand dollars in fresh water to clean them place the sand dollars in a container filled with fresh water as the sand dollar sits the water should start to get brown when the water gets to be a murky brown replace it with fresh water and submerge the sand dollars again keep swapping out the water and submerging the dollars in fresh water until it stops turning brown 1 x research source fully cleaning the sand dollars could take anywhere from 1 3 hours sand dollars can be found in shallow water in the sand on a beach or under seaweed soak the sand dollars in a bleach and water solution for 5 10 minutes pour 1 part bleach and 3 parts cold water into a bucket or container to create your solution this process will whiten off white or brownish sand dollars 2 x research source wear a pair of rubber gloves and carefully place the sand dollars into the solution to bleach them 3 x research source do not soak the sand dollars in the bleach solution for too long or they can crumble rinse off the sand dollars and let them dry run the sand dollars under cold water from your faucet to remove the bleach and water solution leave the sand dollars in a sunny place for 1 2 hours to dry them let the sand dollars completely dry before moving onto the next step 4 x research source create a 1 1 mixture of water and pva glue pour the pva or white glue into a container and add an equal amount of water mix the solution together with a wooden stick or a brush until the glue and water are mixed thoroughly applying this solution will harden the sand dollar and make it easier to paint on 5 x research source elmer s glue all is a popular type of pva glue coat the sand dollars with the glue and water solution dip a paintbrush into the glue and water solution apply the solution liberally over the top surface and underside of the sand dollars with large broad strokes 6 x research source lay the sand dollars on 2 chopsticks and let them dry lay 2 chopsticks or toothpicks on a table so that they are parallel to each other then lay the sand dollar over the sticks so that the chopsticks or toothpicks prop the sand dollar off the surface of the table this will serve as a makeshift stand and will prevent the solution from coming off the bottom of the sand dollar 7 x research source decide whether to use watercolor or acrylic paint watercolors will give your design a muted cloudy image while acrylic paint will produce richer more vibrant colors if you want a more precise design that s easier to control use acrylic paint if you like more abstract and blended designs use watercolors 8 x research source the way that these paints act on canvas or paper is similar to how they will react on your sand dollar if you ve painted with these mediums before use your past experience to determine what kind of paint to use fill a cup up with water and sit it next to your workstation you need water to clean off your brush when switching colors you ll also need to use water to mix and apply watercolor paint when the water starts to get a murky brown or gray empty the cup in your sink and refill it with fresh water 9 x research source squeeze the paint onto a palette if you re using tubed paint if you re using paint from a tube you ll need a wooden paper or plastic palette to mix your paints unscrew the cap from the paint and slowly squeeze the bottom of the tube over your palette squeeze 1 2 drops of paint for every color that you want to use 10 x research source you only need 1 2 drops of paint when starting off create a design on the sand dollar with a pencil softly drawing an outline will help give you an idea of what kind of design you want before you start painting after you re done creating the outline you can fill in your drawing with different colors 11 x research source dip your brush in water make sure that the end of your brush is fully saturated you ll need a decent amount of water to activate watercolor paint and keep acrylic paint from drying out 12 x research source dip your brush into the paint take the brush and swirl it around in the paint to transfer it onto your brush once your brush is loaded with paint you can start applying it to the sand dollar apply paint to the sand dollar with small strokes use small strokes at first to see how the paint reacts to the sand dollar follow along with the outline that you drew or follow the natural contours of the sand dollar if you re using watercolor you ll have less control over how the paint will react once it makes contact with the sand dollar 13 x research source clean your brush in the cup of water before you switch colors or it could make your design look murky and brown if you want to paint the top and bottom surface of the sand dollar make sure you let it dry before flipping it over if you re using acrylic paint let the paint dry before applying a second coat so that the colors don t blend together let the sand dollar dry sit the sand dollar out for 3 4 hours and let it fully dry touch the surface of the sand dollar to make sure that the paint has dried before handling it or you may smudge the paint blend colors together when using watercolors watercolors are meant to blend together for an abstract look play around with how the colors blend together and bleed into the sand dollar to create a design 14 x research source take notice of the natural contours of the sand dollar and make strokes along natural lines and creases apply a second coat of paint for bold colors use your brush and go over sections of the sand dollar with the same color that you put down for your first coat this will deepen colors and make them pop you can do this with both watercolor and acrylic paint 15 x research source decorate the painted sand dollar with a marker use a fine point felt tip marker to create additional designs on the surface of the sand dollar once it has dried you can write your name a quote or embellish your current design 16 x research source use glitter acrylic paint to make your sand dollar pop glitter acrylic paint can make your sand dollars sparkle if you want to add a glitter effect to your sand dollars purchase this special paint online or at an arts crafts store then use it as you would regular acrylic paint 17 x research source coat the sealer in a polymer acrylic varnish to make it shiny adding an acrylic varnish on top of the dried paint will seal in the colors and will give the sand dollar a shiny finish purchase a polymer varnish online or at an arts and crafts store and read the directions before using it then apply a coat over the top surface and underside of the sand dollar let it dry overnight before handling it 18 x research source some polymer varnishes need to be mixed with water before they are used polymer varnishes can either be sprayed onto the sand dollar or applied with a paint brush,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to collect shells,if you ve been to the beach before you ve probably spotted beautiful seashells if you haven t been to the beach before you ve probably admired them too seashells or mollusca come in all sorts of colors textures and shapes so it s no wonder that they ve become collector s items whether you re a casual shell seeker on a family vacation or a serious conchologist someone who studies and collects shells there are various tips and techniques to follow to have the best shell collecting experience,decide how committed you want to be to shell collecting if you just want some pretty seashells to bring home from vacation you may not be as curious to learn the peak hours and locations to find particular shells however the more serious shell collectors may have specific shells they seek in which case they will need to do a little more research keep in mind that if you are a casual shell collector on vacation you may have issues bringing your shells through airport security figure out which shells are common in your area there are resources online to determine this by knowing which shells are most prevalent near you you ll know exactly what to keep your eyes peeled for and it can also give you an idea about how easy or difficult it will be to locate shells if you re committed to finding great shells you may even consider traveling to find the best ones if the shells are sparse where you live or if you don t live near a beach you can go to some beaches that are famous for their bounty sanibel island on florida s gulf coast is regarded by many as the best shell collecting spot in north america 1 x research source figure out where you should be looking some beaches may be littered with shells and a casual jaunt down the beach can result in a gorgeous variety however other beaches may be bare and you ll need to dig a little to find shells rocky beaches may contain more shell fragments than intact shells so you may have to patiently sort through debris to find the shells you seek in some places you may even want to snorkel or scuba dive to find the coolest shells the prime shell spots will vary depending on where you live or travel so research and explore the beaches near you figure out when you should be looking just like hunting or fishing there are prime times when you re more likely to find the shells you re after when the tide is low you ll be able to search for shells that may be covered by water during high tide more beach is exposed so low tide is a great time for a shell collecting excursion tides are caused by gravitational forces between the earth and moon 2 x research source tide levels and times depend on where you re located so it s best to look online or in your local paper for tide charts for your area before you head off to collect shells different varieties of shells often wash ashore during big storms so you can find some gems if you head to the beach right after bad weather 3 x research source wear the proper clothing and footwear if you re going to be wading deep into water you may want to wear a bathing suit and skip the footwear all together if you re going shell collecting on rocky terrain you may want to wear sneakers and comfortable clothing keep in mind that sometimes your feet can be as useful as your hands when collecting shells by digging into wet mud or sand with your toes you may be able to find shells that are not visible above surface on that note be careful so you don t cut yourself on sharp edges bring a bucket a net a spade a filter and other tools you may need you ll need a bucket to hold all of your new treasures if you re interested in searching in deeper waters using a net to scoop up sand will be more effective than digging around with your hands with a spade or shovel you can dig out shells you find deep in the ground a filter or screen can be used to sift through sand and mud once you know the habitat and the shells you ll be collecting you can determine which tools to bring along with you wear sunscreen and a hat nothing ruins a great day collecting shells in the outdoors like a painful peeling sunburn make sure to protect yourself from the glaring sun especially if you get distracted in your search for shells a hat or sunglasses can also help shade you from the sun and make it easier to spot shells leave shells with living creatures alone this is considered proper etiquette among shell collectors there are beautiful shells that are empty or have a dead creature inside and those are yours for the taking if there is a living creature inside a shell you ve found give it a chance to live if it s washed up put it back in the surf clean your shells depending on where you ve collected them from they may be covered in dirt or grime or even animal tissue gently washing your shells can make them look beautiful for your display or collection and can also remove any odor that may linger you ll need dishwashing liquid soap warm water an old toothbrush some rags wd 40 or another lubricant and possibly tweezers to clean your shells up scrub your shell with warm water and dish soap using the toothbrush the brush is great to get into all the ridges and crevices of the shell you can use the tweezers to pick out any stuck debris or barnacles dry your shells with the rags and use the wd 40 to shine them up if your shell has animal tissue attached you may need to boil it for a few minutes before beginning the cleaning process boiling it will loosen up the tissue and you can use the tweezers to pull out the tissue learn about your shells while it s easy to admire shells for their aesthetic beauty learning about them can give them a whole new layer seashells com provides a thorough shell identification guide complete with photographs and you can learn all about the different types of shells you ve collected you can show off your newfound knowledge by creating labels and informational cards for each shell or just learn about them for fun 4 x research source display your shells there are several great ways to display your new collection some collectors fill a clear jar or vase with your treasures and use it as décor in their home if you d rather display your collection methodically with labels boxes with dividers work excellently those can be found at most container stores or craft stores if you want to keep your shells pristine keep them away from direct sunlight shells react differently to bright light but many are damaged by too much the oil from human skin can also cause wear and tear to the shells clear display cases are great to show off your shells without constantly handling them,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to clean paua shells,paua also known as abalone in the u s and australia and ormer in the u k is the mĝori name for several species of large edible sea snails while paua is most commonly viewed as food in coastal regions it is also prized by some collectors for its iridescent shell which glimmers with brilliant red golden and blue green hues when properly cleaned and polished,mix up a diluted bleach solution in a bucket or similar large container fill your container with 3 5 gallons 11 19 l of clean water then pour in roughly 1 2 cups 240 470 ml of bleach the two liquids will create a mild soaking solution that s strong enough to rid your paua shells of bacteria without causing weathering or other damage 1 x research source anytime you re working with bleach you ll want to slip on some rubber or nitrile gloves to protect your skin from irritation 2 x research source add the bleach to the water not the other way around this will cut down on the amount of harmful fumes circulating throughout your work area soak your paua in the bleach solution for a minimum of 30 minutes for best results let them sit for several hours or even overnight the bleach will sterilize the shells gradually as they soak while also loosening stuck on grime brightening their vivid hues and neutralizing any unpleasant fishy smell 3 x research source make sure the shells are completely submerged in the solution this may require you to tinker with the quantities of water and bleach you use depending on the size of your container and the number of paua you re cleaning wash the bleached shells with warm soapy water after allowing your paua to soak for your preferred length remove them from the solution and take them to the sink in your kitchen or bathroom rinse each shell under the faucet for a few seconds to remove the excess bleach then gather them up and swish them through a separate container filled with warm water and mild liquid dish soap 5 x research source remember to wear gloves when retrieving your shells from their soaking container you can also fish them out with a pair of metal tongs to decrease your risk even more rinse the shells thoroughly for a second time following their soapy water bath any traces of soap left on their outer surfaces could dry into a cloudy film allow the shells to air dry find an out of the way spot with good ventilation in or near your home and stretch out an absorbent towel arrange your paua on the towel with their exterior surfaces facing outward leaving at least 1 2 inch 1 3 cm of space between each shell they should dry completely within a few short hours 6 x research source it s okay to dry paua shells outdoors but keep them out of direct sunlight prolonged exposure to intense uv rays could leach some of their handsome coloration 7 x research source pull on a facemask or respirator a pair of gloves and some eye protection muriatic acid is extremely potent and could cause chemical burns if it happens to come into contact with your skin for this reason it s important to make sure that you re well protected before you get started 8 x research source it s also a good idea to wear long sleeved clothing and closed toed shoes to prevent any acid from getting on your skin you can buy muriatic acid at any hardware store or home improvement center it takes quite a bit of acid to clean a single shell so make sure you pick up enough for all of the shells you plan on treating 9 x research source take your shell outside and rest it on a flat stable surface a large rock or piece of scrap wood will make an ideal acid washing platform it s also perfectly fine to place the shell directly on the ground if you don t have a more suitable work surface 10 x research source never work with muriatic acid indoors not only will most enclosed spaces fail to provide adequate ventilation for the fumes but the acid itself could potentially eat through or discolor household surfaces pour enough acid over the shell to soak the outside you ll notice bubbles forming as soon as the acid touches the shell let the acid remain on the shell for 20 30 seconds or until it stops fizzing during this time it will begin to dissolve the hardened mineral deposits on the outer surface 11 x research source this bubbling action is the result of the muriatic acid reacting with the sodium bicarbonate that makes up the shell rinse the shell thoroughly with clean water the best way to do this is to set up your materials near a garden hose or outdoor tap otherwise simply fill up a watering can pitcher large bottle or similar container and keep it close at hand allow the water to wash over both the shell and the surrounding surface for at least 3 5 full seconds 12 x research source do not move reposition or otherwise touch the shell until after you ve rinsed it a good rinse will flush away most of the acid and dilute what s left to the point that you can handle the shell safely scrub the shell vigorously with a wire brush go over the entire exterior using short quick forceful strokes the outermost layer of sediment and debris should come off relatively easily after being broken down by the acid keep scrubbing until you stop making progress it will then be time to repeat the process 13 x research source paua shells are one of the hardest natural materials known to man so don t be afraid to really get after it here the harder you scrub the better your shell will come out looking 14 x research source cleaning paua can be painstaking work take your time and work patiently and carefully use a hammer and chisel to remove stubborn buildup and unwanted features older paua shells are often covered with a thick armor of calcified lime along with barnacles smaller shells and other types of growth if you don t want to keep any these on your shell a few taps with a hammer and chisel will take them right off 15 x research source a screwdriver can also do the trick nicely if you don t own an actual chisel you may need a more slender tool such as an ice pick to scrape out the loose gunk deep down in the shell s many grooves and recesses repeat the process until your paua takes on the desired appearance you may have to wash rinse and scrub the shell several times to get it completely free of foreign substances with each round more and more of its natural coloration will begin to show through 16 x research source all in all your project shouldn t take you longer than a couple of hours spray the shell with a coat of polyurethane to preserve its luster when you re happy with the look of your paua shell pat it dry with an absorbent towel and set it on a layer of newsprint or paper towels then grab a can of spray on polyurethane shake well and hit both sides of the shell from various angles afterwards allow it to air dry for 1 2 hours or until the sealant dries to the touch 17 x research source the polyurethane will seal up all of the tiny pores and crevices in the surface of the shell and leave it with a slick glossy sheen that will accentuate its naturally holographic colors this final step is optional while a clear coat can help your newly cleaned shell retain its beauty for longer it will be just as eye catching with or without it wear a facemask or respirator and some form of ear protection polishing paua involves lots of grinding and sanding which generates quite a bit of dust putting some kind of barrier between your shells and your nose and mouth will keep you from breathing in any particles that might irritate your airways similarly a pair of earmuffs or plugs will help block out the noise from the small power tools you ll be working with 18 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source for maximum safety it s also a good idea to set up your materials outside or in an open garage or similar well ventilated area you may want to consider pulling on a pair of durable work gloves to safeguard your hands against scrapes and scratches though this isn t a necessity fit an angle grinder or power polisher with a low grit grinding wheel a coarse 40 50 grit pad is ideal for the initial grinding phase simply undo the clamp nut at the center of the device s rotating head with an allen wrench and slip the wheel into place with the textured side facing outwards once the wheel is in place replace and retighten the clamp nut 20 x research source an orbital sander will also work well for this task anytime you change out the wheels on your grinder polisher or sander make sure that the power switch is flipped to the off position it s also a good idea to unplug the device just to be on the safe side don t worry if you don t have access to any of these tools you can get the same high gloss finish with ordinary sandpaper and a little bit of patience 21 x research source run your polishing device over the thick layer of lime on the shell s exterior turn on your grinder polisher or sander and hold the edge of the wheel against the surface of the shell using light to moderate pressure the whirling abrasive pad will quickly wear down the mineral buildup concealing the paua s beautiful natural coloration 22 x research source if you re sanding by hand run a sheet of 60 150 grit sandpaper back and forth over the shell in 3 4 in 7 6 10 2 cm sections this will take quite a bit longer than machine grinding but it will still get the job done 23 x research source avoid pressing your polisher into the shell too hard as too much direct force could cause it to crack or break paua shells tend to accumulate a thick coat of lime in their natural environment this buildup allows them to blend in with their surroundings and helps defend them from predators wipe the shell periodically with a wet piece of sandpaper this will clear away any dust that s gathered on the surface keeping it from finding its way into the air and making it easier for you to see what you re doing the moisture will also cut down on the amount of dust produced by subsequent rounds of polishing 24 x research source a damp cloth or sponge will also work for this purpose alternatively you can dip the entire shell in a container full of water it will be especially important to keep your shell wet if you re using wet polishing pads typically require occasional cooling 25 x research source continue using progressively finer pads or sandpaper once you ve removed as much sediment as you can with your 40 50 grit grinding pad swap it out for a 60 80 grit sanding pad or piece of sandpaper and go over the shell again then replace the 60 80 grit pad with a fine 150 220 grit polishing pad or sandpaper sheet and so on all in all you may end up making 4 6 separate passes 26 x research source each time you equip a finer pad the overall clarity and vibrancy of the shell will increase if you like you can work all the way up to a 300 grit polisher or higher for an ultra smooth high gloss finish spray your paua with a coat of polyurethane to seal in its beauty make sure your shell is completely dry and free of any remaining dust place it on a layer of newsprint or paper towels hollow side down and blast it from multiple angles with a can of spray on polyurethane after about an hour turn the shell over and spray the underside then let it sit for another 1 2 hours to dry completely 27 x research source adding a clear coat will enhance your paua s freshly polished shine and protect it from dust damage and deterioration,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to remove wine labels for collecting,collecting wine labels has become an increasingly popular hobby an intact wine label can be a wonderful way to remember a special occasion or a great glass of wine if you d like to carefully remove and preserve wine bottle labels you ll need to expose the adhesive backing to a heat source once it s melted use the edge of a utility knife to lift off a corner of the label and the whole thing should peel right off whether you use boiling water or an oven work with caution and protect your hands from the hot glass bottle by wearing oven gloves,boil 3 cups 710 ml of water in a kettle a wine bottle holds about 3 cups 710 ml of liquid so use this much water for each bottle you want to remove the label from pour the water into a kettle and bring it to a rolling boil 1 x research source if you boil water in a saucepan it will be much harder to pour it into the bottle later pour the boiling water directly into the empty wine bottle stand up your wine bottle in the sink wear an oven glove on one hand and use this to hold the wine bottle steady if your kettle has a narrow spout you can slowly pour the boiling water directly into the bottle if not consider using a funnel to get the water down the bottleneck more easily 2 x research source be careful not to splash yourself or the label while you pour the water into the bottle wait for about 5 to 10 minutes while the water melts the adhesive if your bottle is standing upright in your sink simply leave it there for a few minutes allow about 5 to 10 minutes for the boiling water to melt the glue on the back of the label from the inside out 3 x research source tip the hot water out of the wine bottle slip on a pair of oven gloves after leaving the water in the bottle for a few minutes grab ahold of the wine bottle and carefully tip out the hot water into the sink use caution as the glass will be hot 4 x research source if necessary use a towel to soak up any drips from the glass or the label peel the label off of the bottle using the edge of a utility knife once the water has been emptied out use one hand to hold the bottle still with the other hand carefully slide the edge of a utility knife or razor blade underneath one corner of the wine label once it comes up delicately lift off the rest of the label the great part about this technique is that you won t need to get the label wet this is a great way to remove special labels that you re worried about damaging be careful as you do this since the glass may still be hot preheat your oven to 350 f 177 c degrees once you ve finished off a bottle of wine you can warm it up in the oven to melt the adhesive backing make sure your oven is empty then set the temperature to 350 f 177 c 5 x research source before you preheat the oven you can set your bottle inside to see if it stays put without rolling around warm the empty uncorked bottle in the oven for 10 minutes lay the bottle down on the center rack making sure it doesn t roll around turn the bottle so that the label you want to preserve faces upwards wait about 10 minutes for the adhesive on the back of the label to melt 6 x research source if necessary set the bottle in a glass casserole dish to hold it in place wear oven gloves to transfer the bottle from the oven to a cooling rack after about 10 minutes put oven gloves on both of your hands and carefully remove the wine bottle from the oven it will be hot so use caution set it on a cooling rack so it doesn t leave any burn marks on your work surface 7 x research source use the edge of a utility knife to lift the label off of the bottle slide the edge of a utility knife or razor blade underneath one corner of the label once you do this slowly and gently peel the label off of the glass use the knife to cut through any stubborn patches of adhesive 8 x research source when you re peeling back the label use even steady pressure to avoid ripping the paper if the label won t budge just let the bottle cool down to room temperature you can try another method later air dry the adhesive or preserve the sticky label on paper since the melted adhesive backing will be sticky you can allow it to air dry or place it onto another material if you d like to wait for the glue to dry leave the label face down on a sheet of parchment paper overnight if you want to preserve it in a book or on a sheet of paper place it onto the page while it s still sticky and press down the edges to attach it 9 x research source bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil fill a large stockpot about 1 3 of the way up with water place this onto a stovetop burner and set the temperature to high wait about 15 or 20 minutes for the water to reach a rolling boil 10 x research source if you have a 2 piece pasta pot use the base to hold the water you ll be able to place the wine bottle in the colander part hold the empty uncorked bottle over the steam for at least 30 minutes wearing oven gloves pick up the empty uncorked bottle and hold it directly above the boiling water be careful not to allow the label to touch the water rotate the bottle every few minutes to expose the front and back of the label to the steam 11 x research source keep the water going at a steady simmer or rolling boil to keep generating steam the steam will gently melt the adhesive backing on many wine labels if you re using a 2 piece pasta pot lower the colander insert into the base then stand the wine bottle up inside the colander unless you re using a colander insert you ll need to manually hold the bottle over the water while it steams to avoid getting it wet peel off the label using a utility knife and oven gloves the glass will be hot after having sat over the steam for a while so make sure you re wearing oven gloves with the tip of a utility knife or razor blade gently lift up one corner of the wine label if it doesn t budge expose the bottle to the steam for another 10 or 15 minutes once it starts to come loose slowly lift off the entire label 12 x research source once the adhesive has softened the label should come off easily in one piece air dry the label on a sheet of parchment paper if the label ends up being slightly damp after having been exposed to the steam allow it to air dry overnight set it on a sheet of parchment paper with the adhesive side up this will allow the glue to harden while the front of the label dries off 13 x research source this is a useful technique to use on labels that you don t want to submerge in water fill a large pot with hot water boil enough water to fill a stockpot about 2 3 of the way up make sure you use enough water to completely cover the entire wine label once you set the bottle into the pot 14 x research source you can use hot water from the tap instead but it might not be as effective as just boiled water submerge the empty uncorked bottle in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes stand up the bottle in the pot full of hot water if necessary add a little more water so that the top of the label is covered by the water leave it to soak for about 10 to 15 minutes or so 15 x research source if desired you can purchase a chlorinated soap from a wine store that s designed to help to dissolve the adhesive be sure to follow the manufacturer s instructions so you use the product correctly remove the bottle from the hot water and dry it off put on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves to provide some grip and protect your hands from the hot water use caution as you lift out the wine bottle as it will be hot dry off the outside of the bottle with a towel 16 x research source peel off the damp label using the edge of a utility knife once the bottle is dry slide the blade of a utility knife underneath one of the corners of the label once it starts to come loose carefully peel up the rest of the label work slowly to avoid tearing the label 17 x research source the hot water soak will have softened up the adhesive so you should be able to preserve the label in one piece be careful not to rub or scratch the damp paper as it will easily get damaged allow the label to air dry overnight set the damp label on a piece of parchment

banks usually give these cylindrical wrappers out for free at least in the united states and in countries that use the euro as currency and they are also available for purchase at some supermarkets the wrappers may be made out of paper or transparent plastic and come in a different size for each type of coin these wrappers are usually labeled with the name of the coin but there may be a color coded system as well for instance in the united states red wrappers are for pennies blue for nickels green for dimes and orange for quarters 1 x research source separate your coins into different types gather your change and separate the coins by type you can keep the different coins in rough piles for now there is no need to stack them or count them yet if you have a large amount of mixed coins you may prefer to look at the section on other methods for information on coin sorting machines lay out the coins of one type onto a bed or other soft surface take your newly separated coins of one type such as nickels or 25 euro cent coins and place them on a flat surface cleared of other objects spread them out with your hands until they form a single layer of coins a freshly made bed a comforter stretched over a coffee table or a similar soft surface makes it easy to pick up the coins and to keep piles of coins separated in their own dents in the material 2 x research source separate the coins into piles of ten coins work with both hands at once counting to ten as you pick up one coin in each hand once you have ten coins in each hand place each group of ten coins in its own separate pile as you keep doing this the task should become easier and faster you may be tempted to stack the coins instead of making piles but this is usually a waste of time since the stacks often fall over 3 x research source push open the wrappers unfold one end of each wrapper if necessary some wrappers are sold as open tubes in which case you can skip this step as with any task this becomes faster with repetition opening all your wrappers at once will be faster than opening one filling it with coins opening the next etc check how many coins there are per roll each wrapped roll of coins contains a certain number of coins depending on the wrapper you can calculate this based on the value printed on the wrapper or refer to the following list each u s roll contains 50 pennies 40 nickels 50 dimes or 40 quarters 4 x research source each euro roll contains 50 one cent two cent or five cent coins 40 ten cent twenty cent or fifty cent coins or 25 one euro or two euro coins 5 x research source pick up enough piles to make one roll for example if you are picking up pennies pick up five piles of ten pennies each since 5 x 10 50 if you are rolling one euro or two euro coins you ll need to pick up 2½ piles or two full piles twenty coins total and half of another pile five coins if you have small hands you may need to pick up a smaller amount of coins and fill each roll in sections arrange the handful of coins into a cylinder shape shake the coins gently in your hand while using your other hand to arrange them in a sideways stack once finished the coins will be standing on their edge running in a line from your palm to your cupped fingertips when you re rolling coins for the first time make the cylinder of coins as even as possible to make it easy to get the coins in the paper or plastic wrapper as you practice this you ll be able to work faster and make looser cylinders 6 x research source pour the coins into a wrapper if the wrapper is open on both ends stick a finger from your other hand into one end of the wrapper up to the first joint to block it off then tilt your hand down toward the other open end letting the coins slide down into the wrapper if the coins get stuck or fall out over the wrapper slide all the coins out and repeat the process this will happen less and less often as you practice 7 x research source fold the open ends of the wrapper place a finger on each end of the filled wrapper and move the coins from side to side until there is an equal amount of space on each end fold down each end of the wrapper to form a closed end for flat coin wrappers fold the two creased edges down over the coin then fold the two remaining points down over them repeat with the other side repeat for your remaining coins pick up another pile form it into a stack and pour it into the next wrapper as you continue you ll find this process getting easier and more automatic allowing you to simultaneously hold a conversation listen to a podcast or perform some other task that doesn t use your hands use a coin counting machine at a supermarket or your bank many large stores have coin counting machines which rapidly count inserted mixed coins and returns paper money however these usually charge you a percentage of your total coin value as a fee or gives you full value only in the form of a gift certificate to certain retailers certain banks

cheap electronic coin counting machines may jam after a few uses 8 x research source look for reviews online before buying one measure your change collection s value by weight because coins are minted with a precise size and composition of metals each one weighs a certain predictable amount you can estimate the value of a mixed coin collection using coincalc com or for u s coinage or separate them

source coins in poor p fair f about good ag or good g condition generally aren t fine enough for collectors these coins have a somewhat legible date and mint mark but a good deal of the design is indistinguishable however they can be used to hold a place in a collection until a finer specimen is found coins graded very good vg show a worn design but are generally attractive and free of gouges or other mutilations a fine f coin is highly legible and the design is clear but a bit worn these coins are attractive and desirable to collectors a very fine vf coin has only light wear with a very clear mint mark date and design an extremely fine xf coin has wear only on the high points of the design about uncirculated au uncirculated u choice uncirculated cu or gem uncirculated gu coins are

how to find a toy that is no longer in stores,after a toy that has long left the shelves or has sold out while there is no guarantee that you ll find the exact item you re after there are fortunately a lot of ways to find a toy that is no longer sold in the store it all really depends on how determined you are to make the effort,visit online stores that sell toys some online retailers may retain older stocks of toys or will know how to source them for you check out stores that specialize in online toy sales and more specifically that have a focus on discontinued toy lines to see what they have on offer it is also a good idea to check out stores that carry used toys in good condition you can use a site such as flipkart or andromeda look on major auction or trading sites there are quite a few of these around the world and there is a big possibility that someone somewhere is selling that toy you re after the trick is to not look just in your own backyard but to search worldwide some auction sites are international while some are country specific this means that while you ll likely have no problems finding things on the international sites be sure to also check sites available in the countries where the item was originally manufactured especially if this is not china some sellers specialize in selling discontinued or hard to find toys through sites such as ebay and etsy check out trade or swap sites run by collectors or fans such sites may have forums trading places and other ways to connect with fellow fans or collectors of the toy you re after be prepared to either pay a fair price plus shipping or to give something of equal value in exchange check out freebie sites sites that allow giveaways such as freecycle are great places to check for old toys join up then browse through the lists of freebies available in your area if nothing is showing up that is relevant place a wanted request and wait someone may just have the toy you re after check toy stores that are more out of the way or stuck in time these are the stores in out of way places such as the countryside or a suburb with mostly elderly residents they may still carry stocks long exhausted in the larger urban areas do a phone around of such stores including country or rural toy stores to see whether they have old stock not yet sold you can even extend this search to stores in other countries where the toy may not have sold out as quickly or have been as popular as your own country check thrift charity or opportunity stores the item will likely be used but in many cases you can often find old toys in good condition in lucky cases the item might even still be in its box unused however this is a very hit and miss method so you ll need to have a good eye for sifting through junk boxes and prepare to be disappointed a lot of the time check secondhand or antique stores if the stores stock toys there is a chance that your toy might be there especially if it s a collectible to save time it can be easier to call the store first if it turns out that they stock the items head on down to check out their supplies if not keeping phoning around check out wholesalers that sell discontinued stock if they deal in toys it is possible that they might have your toy if it was discontinued in recent years check out which auction houses deal with toys they might have online catalogs or it might be easier to call and ask if they have the toy coming up for auction and whether they know of a collector who might be willing to sell one visit toy auctions these are fun so you can plan to go to one just to enjoy it it might be a good opportunity to find that old toy in many cases there is a premium placed on the condition of the toy including coming with its original box or packaging so if that s what you re after toy auctions are a great choice check out storage auctions or liquidation auctions sometimes old toys get caught up in storage places or become part of liquidated assets of failed businesses this is a long shot as it requires turning up to all sorts of auctions that don t identify the stock necessarily but if you like rummaging and think auctions are fun you just never know what might turn up if toys are mentioned it might be worth going even if all you get is something cool to trade with,Hobbies-and-Crafts

cabinet is a good idea binders are more frail than boxes and should be placed in a storage box if you re storing them for a long time make sure your basement or attic is free from excess issues like heat or moisture if this is the case you should store it somewhere more temperate such as a bedroom closet if you have to store your cards in a damp or hot area you should invest in rigid snap cases

maker of the card the year sport player name number condition and whether or not the card itself is signed other card systems such as character cards should be catalogued according to each of that

how to collect postcards,deltiology is the official term for collecting and studying postcards 1 x research source the third largest hobby after collecting stamps and money 2 x research source collecting postcards can be a very rewarding pastime that can be as broad or as narrow as you d like and can be undertaken absolutely anywhere in the world even queen victoria is thought to have had her own postcard collection so it s certainly a hobby that has both pedigree and time behind it if you re keen to do something with the postcards you ve got stashed at home or you re wondering whether or not to indulge in buying them every time you re traveling or sightseeing perhaps deltiology will open up a new world of collecting for you,decide how you will approach collecting postcards the breadth of postcards is so wide that it s probably a good idea to develop your focus early on to avoid having box loads of unsorted postcards and not knowing what to do with them all postcards can be collected in many ways but some of the most common approaches are as follows postcards by a particular artist postcards from a particular location or country postcards dating from a particular time postcards with a particular theme such as a specific animal like a cat or wildlife structures such as tall buildings or bridges natural wonders such as waterfalls or canyons household items such as teapots artwork from museum collections transport such as trains trams or planes beach scenes valentine s day christmas star trek etc the possibilities are endless postcards that are humorous cheeky risque or have cartoons on them if you have a particular interest consider collecting postcards related to that interest for example if you love horses then postcards of horses will always appeal to you all sorts of interests like ballet rugby board games aircraft spotting museums dinosaurs weapons food alcohol etc are likely to be found on postcards in one way of another this can add a very interesting dimension to postcard collecting that will bolster your love of your other interest in a unique way some people only collect postcards when they travel given the great photos that professional photographers can take of a place you re visiting it can be a good way to ensure that you have at least one really good photo of the place you ve visited it s also helpful to get postcards that depict different seasons or weather than what you re experiencing on your visit know the general postcard eras while it s incredibly hard to date many postcards because anyone can print them anywhere and that s precisely how it s always been there are some factors that can help you determine the era of postcards 3 x research source 1898 1919 is known as the golden age of postcards when picture postcards were most popular 1901 1906 undivided backs on picture postcards 1907 1915 divided backs on picture postcards in the u s a most other countries had divided backs a few years earlier e g canada from 1903 1915 1930 white border postcards were common 1930 1950 linen collectible postcards 4 x research source post 1940 postcards were produced as modern chromes namely color photographs instead of the photo chromes generated from black and white photos in earlier postcards early chromes date from the 1940s to the 1960s given that postcards are usually sent within a few years of production the postmark can be an indicator then again everyone has seen very dusty old postcards that haven t sold for years in some stores and there is nothing to stop anyone from posting a very old postcard 50 to 100 years later if they feel like it so the postmark isn t always a good indicator if the postcard presents a city street or other view that can be matched to photos of a certain time that can help to date the postcard learn the collector s terminology and focus once you start getting quite serious about collecting postcards you ll learn that there are quite a few things to take into account when collecting them as a beginner aiming to have fun with your hobby simply be aware of these initially and over time you may want to direct your attention more to the collectible indicators to ensure that you have a postcard collection of the highest quality should you wish to show it at a special event or sell it for good value things of importance when collecting any paper collectible such as postcards include condition age anything interesting about the postcard such as its age the artist photographer the image sometimes the printer and the postcard s rarity other things that might be notable include the author of the writing on it the content of the writing the address the stamp postmark and any other elements such as the post office marking the postcard as prohibited censored due to censorship or war etc any one of these elements alone could cause a particular postcard to be very special and any of these elements could also form the basis of your collection for example you might want to collect postcards by famous people or by women from a certain era or that have never been posted and are in perfect condition in terms of condition postcards are rated as follows the first three ratings being for serious vintage postcard collectors mint this means that the vintage postcard appears as it would have fresh off the printing press there cannot be any writing postage marks creases bends etc on the postcard for it to be in mint condition they should be stored in acid free archival covers and kept safe from being bent near mint this is almost like mint except for a very minor flaw such as a little yellowing at the edge there cannot be much of a flaw though or it starts to fall down the list again this should be stored in acid free archival covers to protect it for the long term excellent this is a vintage postcard that is in excellent condition so no tears or wear it can be postmarked or written on provided the postcard itself is still in perfect shape as above keep this in acid free archival covers very good this postcard is often mailed postmarked and written upon but it has very few signs of wear and is definitely one to be proud of in a collection good by this stage the postcard has lived a little and shows signs of its journey there may be bent corners a fold creases faded colors etc this one is unlikely to be worth much unless it s particularly unusual rare or was written by something famous fair to poor the rest of the postcards in their grimy beaten up bent crushed creased and other states the reason you keep them mostly because they re sentimental because they complete a set because you like them anyway and so forth just don t expect to make a fortune from them any day soon even so a rare card or a card with great content can be worth a considerable amount even if damaged and in some cases certain forms of wear may even add to the aesthetic appeal of a card the moral is go with what you like without worrying that it isn t expensive spend some time researching the values of postcards it s a good use of time to browse through postcards for sale on auction sites such as ebay doing this will give you an idea of what s available as well as giving you an idea of the prices the postcards are worth and what you can expect to pay for them however at this stage don t get hung up on high values or you won t develop your own style and taste instead focus on buying what you like for now and developing your own theme once you feel more confident that this is the hobby of choice for you and that you want to spend more money on it then you can get serious about spending more money on particular types of postcards until then just enjoy the thrill of adding to your collection for very low prices understand the difference between a real photo postcard and a regular postcard real photo postcards were popular in the golden age less so later they are usually black and white and look like photographs because that s what they are unlike the majority of early postcards which were lithographed sometimes called lithos for short real photo cards were photographs developed directly onto special postcard backs lithographed cards by contrast were usually made from photographs but they were mechanically printed in printing presses you can tell the difference by looking closely at the image if it is a lithograph card the image will be composed of tiny dots like a photograph in a newspaper while the ink in a real photograph will be continuous real photo cards were usually produced in very small quantities because they had to be developed in a darkroom one by one often they were family photos or photos of local events produced by a local photographer for immediate sale on average a real photo postcard will sell for more than a lithographed postcard typically 5 to 10 times more so when you see one box of views of your town selling for 1 5 and another box selling for 10 50 chances are that the reason for the difference is that the first box contains lithographs and the second contains real photos find postcards the places for finding postcards are many and varied but the sources will be determined by how you have narrowed down your collection criteria for example if you re not fussed about the age quality or provenance of the postcard you ll find postcards literally everywhere you go from newspaper stands on the street to your grandma s attic it gets more complicated the more you narrow down your interests and the more you seek older antique postcards but there are still many avenues for finding them even then in particular the places you re likely to find postcards include stores that sell magazines newspapers stationery candies etc will often carry modern current postcards these will usually be souvenir postcards aimed at tourists but you never know what you mind find so be sure to look wherever you are check out truck stops gas stations department stores souvenir stores motel lobbies anywhere that is heavily visited by tourists any place associated with tourists travelers traveling etc will probably have current modern postcards many museums art galleries zoos national parks theme parks science centers aquariums space observatories and other display learning and entertainment areas often carry modern current postcards look online for a very wide variety of postcards both new and old to antique auction sites antique sites and postcard seller sites will provide you with a wide array of choices visit a postcard trade show here you ll find nothing but postcards visit antique stores flea markets garage and yard sales secondhand bookstores and other similar stores for older postcards auction houses may also sell postcards and if you re after someone s existing collection an auction house or an art or vintage collectibles auction are good places to start ask family members for old unwanted postcards and go through boxes of stored papers in the attic to see if anyone has stored any over the years that have been sent to them or that they ve collected on trips away ask anyone you know who travels or is going on vacation to send you home at least one postcard this can be a lovely way to treasure their words as well as the postcard for a beginner collector bulk lot purchases of postcards can be a lot of fun you never know what you might get in such a mix but it ll be fun rummaging through it and it might spark more creative ideas for how to put together your postcard collection know what to check for when buying postcards it s easier to check the condition of a postcard in a store than online and yet it s likely that many of your cards will be internet purchases in this case be sure to seek as thorough a photo as possible of the card s condition before buying if you can t see all of the condition or the description is very poor either don t purchase it or only purchase it if it s exceptionally cheap some of the things to be aware of when purchasing cards include cleanliness of the card this is not about whether or not it has been written on it s about the splotches marks grime and grease that builds up on old paper items over time look for postcards that are clean and free of age or grime marks where possible it won t always be possible but it s worth aiming high where you can edges try to find postcards that have even and unbent edges and haven t been torn or dog eared content it s always preferable if you can actually read what has been written on the postcard if it has writing that makes it a lot more enjoyable and gives a sense of history behind the postcard markings mostly this is about the postmark the more legible the better and if it has a date and location that can be read a lot can be learned about the postcard avoid things to avoid include moldy postcards they will never become un moldy really badly battered about unless there is a sentimental or content reason for getting the postcard foxing spots and age marks and grease marks these detract from the overall look stains such as blood grime or water too many folds or creases tears etc if it looks tattered the only reason to get it is because it s rare what is written on it is worth keeping or you ve fallen in love with it but not if it s moldy display and store the postcards the manner in which you keep the postcards is important for safeguarding their quality over the coming years for the really old and the valuable postcards store in archival acid free covers available from hobby stores stamp and postcard retailers and online these will keep dust grime and stains off the postcards and the paper will be safe from acidity keep the cards stored flat and in a place where they cannot be crushed

windowless room if the room does have a window make sure your figures are facing away from it store your figures at room temperature in a dry area when looking for a storage space find a room that has a fairly steady temperature around 70 f 21 c if you re concerned about the humidity of the room use a hygrometer to check that the humidity is around 35 45 2 x research source extreme changes in temperature and humidity can be especially damaging for figures that are still in their original packaging closets and cupboards are normally great places for storing an action figure collection if you have a finished basement you can also store them there as long as it doesn t get too cool or damp purchase sealed storage containers for your most valuable figures for collectibles worth over 100 buy a sealed glass storage container open the container and carefully position your figure inside then close the container and seal it according to the directions the container will protect it from dust and dampness 3 x research source keep in mind that sealed containers will not protect your figures from changes in temperature or exposure to sunlight be sure to keep this in mind when storing your collectibles normally you can find these containers online through websites that specialize in storing collectibles however if you have a store that specializes in storage solutions near you try calling them to see if they have any in stock use a display case if you have a large collection many collectors like to keep their action figures on display look for a case that has glass doors to protect your figures while still showing them off position your figures on the shelves so that they re visible but not overly crowded which can damage them 4 x research source some collectors use bookcases with detachable glass doors to store their figures keep in mind that glass will not protect the action figures from changes in temperature and exposure to sunlight if your shelving doesn t

dust regularly start by dusting the shelves with a duster if they re on display and then use a soft bristle brush such as a makeup brush or paint brush to remove particles from your figures and packaging for delicate figures spray them with pressurized air to remove the dust without touching them 7 x research source you can find pressurized air at most grocery or department stores if you want to buy a few cans at a time search online retailers like amazon to see if you can get a better deal use water and effervescent tablets to clean figures without batteries or decals place dirty or sticky plastic figures in a bowl of warm water then drop an effervescent dental tablet into the water and wait for it to begin bubbling once the tablet is about halfway dissolved flip your figure over in the water to clean the other side 8 x research source never place an action figure that has a battery compartment or sticker decals directly into water this can irreparably damage your figure and can be dangerous to you the bubbles from the tablet work to scrub away the stains and other residue on the plastic you can find effervescent tablets at most grocery stores in the dental care section or you can order them online rub soap and water on stains if your figures have decals or batteries make a mixture of 1 cup 240 ml of water and 1 2 drops of mild dish soap stirring until bubbles form then dip a cotton swab or microfiber cloth into the water and remove excess water by squeezing or pinching rub the stained area until the mark disappears and wipe the area with a dry towel to soak up any leftover water 9 x research source it may take a few sessions of scrubbing for the soap and water to remove the mark completely be patient and use more soapy water as needed never use water on an area where there is a sticker decal or near the battery compartment of a figure use isopropyl alcohol to remove ink and other stains dip a cotton swab into 70 90 isopropyl alcohol and then dab the alcohol over the mark keep dabbing until the mark disappears and then wipe the area with a damp towel to rinse it dry your figure with a towel and inspect the area to make sure there is no discoloration 10 x research source leaving the alcohol on your figure can cause extreme discoloration be sure to rinse it completely before putting it into storage remove the batteries when you aren t using your figures battery acid leaks are dangerous and can damage your figures each time you use a figure remove the batteries before storing it for any period of time if you forget this step remove the batteries as soon as possible to prevent leaks which happen over long periods of time 11 x research source if you open the battery compartment of a figure and see a crystallized white residue put it down and put on a pair of rubber gloves then clean the build up and corrosion with the proper chemicals for that type of battery wear gloves whenever you have to handle your collection to prevent oils from your hands from transferring onto your figures and degrading the plastic put on a pair of cloth gloves before you touch them if your figure has a base try to hold it by the bottom as much as possible to prevent damage to the top portion 12 x research source if you don t have a pair of gloves available use a microfiber cloth or a clean towel to handle your figures this will act as a thick barrier and protect the plastic consider getting insurance for your collection if you have an extensive collection you might want to contact an insurance company to appraise and insure the collection in case of accidental damage or a natural disaster to get an insurance policy make sure you have a detailed list of which figures are in the collection pictures of each figure receipts or some other proof of purchase for each figure 13 x research source depending on which insurance company you use they might also require that the figures are kept in a safe protected environment if you own a house

how to date old ball mason jars,ball mason jars are a type of home canning jar made by the ball corporation the company started making mason jars back in 1880 and many people today still use these for canning or collect the jars as a hobby there are many ways to date old ball mason jars and one of the easiest is to look at the logo along with the logo you can sometimes use the color size and other distinguishing marks to help date a mason jar,look for the early bbgmc logo this is one of the earliest logos used by ball back when the company was known as the ball brothers glass manufacturing company because the jars were made in buffalo new york these are called buffalo jars today buffalo jars are rare and old if you have a mason jar with this logo it was manufactured between 1885 and 1886 1 x research source see if your jar has block letters ball began using block letters for the logo on their jars in 1892 and continued using this type of logo until 1896 the major difference between the lettering on these jars and newer jars is the lettering on the older jars is simple printing rather than cursive or stylized lettering 2 x research source check for the first ball script logo in 1895 ball introduced their first logo that used cursive lettering this is also when ball began underlining their logo between 1895 and 1896 the ball logo was relatively straight rather than angled toward the upper right side of the jar look for the 3 l logo the ball logo has remained relatively standard since the first script logo was introduced but there have been a number of small variations that can be used to date the jar the 3 l logo for instance was only used between 1900 and 1910 this logo is called the 3 l logo because the decorative loop at the end of the logo looks like a third l in the ball name 3 x research source look for the dropped a between 1910 and 1923 the a in the word ball had an ascender at the beginning that looked like it should connect with the b because the b and the a don t connect this called the dropped a at this time ball also adopted the 2 l style logo where the decorative loop on the end of the name was dropped look for a ball jar without an underscore the cursive word ball without the underscore was only produced between 1923 and 1933 check for the looped b this moves into the 1933 to 1962 age range there is an underscore a b with a loop in the center and a very small a look for the b connected to the underscore starting in the 1960s the lower part of the b connected to the underline this indicates a date range between 1960 and today 4 x research source look for christmas lettering ball mason jars with christmas lettering have a unique design that doesn t use their original printed or their traditional cursive lettering instead the lettering is calligraphy and the jar reads masons patent these ball mason jars were manufactured in 1890 5 x research source check for identifying words over the years ball has introduced a variety of different jars that can be identified with certain words that are printed on the jars some of these words were used for many years but the style often changed every couple years improved there were a few times when ball produced jars with improved including in the 1890s when the jars were printed with ball improved 1858 later the jars were produced with the wording ball mason improved between 1900 and 1933 special between 1910 and 1913 ball mason jars were printed with the words ball special mason in all block letters perfect between 1913 and 1922 the word perfect was slightly offset and is left indented from the word mason below 6 x research source sanitary this word was printed on ball mason jars around 1913 and 1915 to indicate that they had the sanitary sure seal the word sanitary is in all capital letters is italicized and appears below the ball logo ideal these were made between 1915 and 1962 square jars with the word square were produced in 1925 eclipse these wide mouthed jars were made between 1926 and 1952 see if your jar is an off size there are a few oddly sized ball mason jars that were produced at very specific times so the size of the jar can be used to date its production in the 1920s and early 1930s ball produced 40 ounce 1 2 l jars that were used for coffee and 42 ounce 1 24 l jars that were popular with bootleggers 7 x research source to measure the capacity of your jar fill it with water and then measure the amount of water the jar holds use the color to get an idea of the age ball created a number of colored mason jars over the years and while the most common is blue there were also jars produced in other colors as well such as green and yellow blue glass ball jars were produced in the late 1890s and early 1900s but the company stopped producing these in 1937 there were also some brown amber jars produced in the 1950s but most of the jars produced after the 1940s were made of clear glass 8 x research source inspect the jar for mistakes there have been a number of mason jars produced over the years that have spelling errors and other mistakes printed on the jars and these can be compared with reference materials to date the jars if you find a jar with an error find a copy of the redbook a price guide for fruit jar collectors to determine the age and price of the jar based on the error 9 x research source one of the most common error jars is a ball jar with a misspelling of the word perfect and common variations include perffct peprect and perefct check for upside down writing ball jars that have an upside down logo are actually upside down jars that were designed to function as coffee dispensers these were manufactured between 1900 and 1910 10 x research source ignore the 1858 patent year ball mason jars were produced for many years with the year 1858 printed on them but this is no indication of the age of jar itself rather 1858 is the year that john mason was granted a patent for his mason jar design and the ball company used this patent year on many jars 11 x research source ignore the 1908 patent date this was another patent date that was printed on many mason jars and that has no bearing on the year of production in fact ball used this patent date on their jars well into the 1930s so this year cannot be used to accurately date a ball jar 12 x research source ignore the mold number on the jar many ball mason jars have a number printed on the bottom of the jar but this is a mold number that does not indicate the year of production rather the mold number tells you where the jar was positioned on the glass making machine that was used to produce it mold numbers are generally a number between zero and 15 and they ll sometimes have a letter included as well 13 x

variety of different labels while there s no exact art to dating an old milk can you can estimate its age by looking for printed brand ingredient and copyright information on the can if your specimen is older try examining its materials to see which historical era it hails from with a little time and diligence you ll be able to better organize your antique collection,take pictures of your can labels so you can digitally enhance them use your phone or a more professional camera to photograph your milk can from different angles focus on the label if the letters or words are degraded at all you might be able to see them more clearly using photo editing software aim to take pictures of the milk can at all angles so you capture all the details of the item 1 x research source if you have difficulty identifying the can later on bring these pictures to an antique professional or upload them to a well informed message board on an antique collecting website examine the the can for a visible company label look at the front and back of the milk can and look for any obvious letters printed or embossed on the surface take note of any brand names so you can search for them on the web later 3 x research source some milk companies are more well known than others and come from different eras of history for instance if your milk can belongs to the union dairy company you can date the can somewhere between the early 1900s and 1980s 4 x research source some milk can labels will come with a visible mascot or logo keep this in mind when you look up your label online identify cans made before 1950 by a 2 or 4 digit number on the label check to see if a 2 or 4 digit number is listed somewhere on the can if the phone number is this short you can safely assume that your milk can was made before 1950 if the phone number has 5 to 7 digits you can determine that the can was made in the 1950s or 1960s 5 x research source in many cases these phone numbers will appear hyphenated on the label older phone numbers didn t use area codes which is why these company numbers are so short look around the can for visible copyright years search all over the can to see if any packaging or shipping year is listed while old cans won t be very specific you might be able to find a visible label take note of this year in case you want to look up more info about your milk can label online 6 x research source not all labels are incredibly exact even if the label indicates that the can was made during a certain year there s a chance that the company could ve manufactured the can in an earlier year attribute certain phrases on the label to the early 20th century use food labeling requirements to your advantage as you inspect the can if your label uses the word cure in the label you can date it back to 1906 or earlier if you see terms like hermetically sealed and packed in sanitary cans date the can somewhere before the 1920s additionally note that any label or can with patent pending written on it was made in the year 1940 or later 7 x research source over the years labeling requirements became more specific for instance after 1920 manufacturers had to include salt added and sugar added on their labels whenever necessary manufacturers have used the good housekeeping seal of approval since 1910 note that the circled c trademark is older than the circled r look around your can to see if you can spot an r or c enclosed in a circle date your can as far back as 1914 if you see the circled c as this was one of the earliest copyright labels if you see a circled r note that your can was made in 1949 or later 8 x research source british milk cans used the reg rd or registered label to indicate copyright around 1884 find cans made in the 1930s and 40s by checking for thick metal construction look on the outside and inside of the can to get a feel for its construction if the metal feels thick and bulky you can estimate that the tin was made in the 1930s or 1940s if the can feels sleeker and less clunky you can assume that the can was made in the 1950s or later 9 x research source the same logic applies to ink and paint used on milk can labels if the detail work was applied in thick layers the milk can was probably made in the 1930s or 40s identify 19th century cans by their thick paper labels gently rub your fingers along the paper label of your milk can if it s still intact if the paper feels thick and bulky you can date the can back to the 19th century or sometime before 1900 if the paper feels thinner and sleeker you can assume that the can was made sometime in the 20th century 10 x research source this isn t the most exact way to date a milk can if the label is in good condition try using the brand and copyright info to more accurately date your can if the label feels embossed in any way the can was likely made sometime after 1890 remember that 19th century cans used 3 pieces of soldered metal feel along the edges to detect any obvious solder lines if the milk can is made of 3 metal pieces that were melded together you can date it back to the 19th century if your milk can is smooth with no melding marks you can date it back to the early 20th century or later 11 x research source since grooves and solder marks made the milk transportation less sanitary the milk transport companies updated the milk can model compare 19th century milk cans to old milk churns examine the size and structure of the can and note if the can is thick around the bottom and tapers off toward the top take a close look at the can s size and try to guess how much milk it can hold if your guess is around 60 us quarts 57 l or more then you might have a railway milk churn which was first made around 1867 12 x research source these cans are named for their resemblance to old time milk churns since these cans are so bulky and large you might find them difficult to carry note that cans with small holes on the cap were made between 1820 and 1940 examine the cap and look for a tiny pinprick hole peeking through the cap of the can if this hole is visible you can date your can somewhere between 1820 and the 1940s if this pinprick isn t visible you can safely assume that the can was made sometime in the mid 20th century or later 13 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to remove wine labels for collecting,collecting wine labels has become an increasingly popular hobby an intact wine label can be a wonderful way to remember a special occasion or a great glass of wine if you d like to carefully remove and preserve wine bottle labels you ll need to expose the adhesive backing to a heat source once it s melted use the edge of a utility knife to lift off a corner of the label and the whole thing should peel right off whether you use boiling water or an oven work with caution and protect your hands from the hot glass bottle by wearing oven gloves,boil 3 cups 710 ml of water in a kettle a wine bottle holds about 3 cups 710 ml of liquid so use this much water for each bottle you want to remove the label from pour the water into a kettle and bring it to a rolling boil 1 x research source if you boil water in a saucepan it will be much harder to pour it into the bottle later pour the boiling water directly into the empty wine bottle stand up your wine bottle in the sink wear an oven glove on one hand and use this to hold the wine bottle steady if your kettle has a narrow spout you can slowly pour the boiling water directly into the bottle if not consider using a funnel to get the water down the bottleneck more easily 2 x research source be careful not to splash yourself or the label while you pour the water into the bottle wait for about 5 to 10 minutes while the water melts the adhesive if your bottle is standing upright in your sink simply leave it there for a few minutes allow about 5 to 10 minutes for the boiling water to melt the glue on the back of the label from the inside out 3 x research source tip the hot water out of the wine bottle slip on a pair of oven gloves after leaving the water in the bottle for a few minutes grab ahold of the wine bottle and carefully tip out the hot water into the sink use caution as the glass will be hot 4 x research source if necessary use a towel to soak up any drips from the glass or the label peel the label off of the bottle using the edge of a utility knife once the water has been emptied out use one hand to hold the bottle still with the other hand carefully slide the edge of a utility knife or razor blade underneath one corner of the wine label once it comes up delicately lift off the rest of the label the great part about this technique is that you won t need to get the label wet this is a great way to remove special labels that you re worried about damaging be careful as you do this since the glass may still be hot preheat your oven to 350 f 177 c degrees once you ve finished off a bottle of wine you can warm it up in the oven to melt the adhesive backing make sure your oven is empty then set the temperature to 350 f 177 c 5 x research source before you preheat the oven you can set your bottle inside to see if it stays put without rolling around warm the empty uncorked bottle in the oven for 10 minutes lay the bottle down on the center rack making sure it doesn t roll around turn the bottle so that the label you want to preserve faces upwards wait about 10 minutes for the adhesive on the back of the label to melt 6 x research source if necessary set the bottle in a glass casserole dish to hold it in place wear oven gloves to transfer the bottle from the oven to a cooling rack after about 10 minutes put oven gloves on both of your hands and carefully remove the wine bottle from the oven it will be hot so use caution set it on a cooling rack so it doesn t leave any burn marks on your work surface 7 x research source use the edge of a utility knife to lift the label off of the bottle slide the edge of a utility knife or razor blade underneath one corner of the label once you do this slowly and gently peel the label off of the glass use the knife to cut through any stubborn patches of adhesive 8 x research source when you re peeling back the label use even steady pressure to avoid ripping the paper if the label won t budge just let the bottle cool down to room temperature you can try another method later air dry the adhesive or preserve the sticky label on paper since the melted adhesive backing will be sticky you can allow it to air dry or place it onto another material if you d like to wait for the glue to dry leave the label face down on a sheet of parchment paper overnight if you want to preserve it in a book or on a sheet of paper place it onto the page while it s still sticky and press down the edges to attach it 9 x research source bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil fill a large stockpot about 1 3 of the way up with water place this onto a stovetop burner and set the temperature to high wait about 15 or 20 minutes for the water to reach a rolling boil 10 x research source if you have a 2 piece pasta pot use the base to hold the water you ll be able to place the wine bottle in the colander part hold the empty uncorked bottle over the steam for at least 30 minutes wearing oven gloves pick up the empty uncorked bottle and hold it directly above the boiling water be careful not to allow the label to touch the water rotate the bottle every few minutes to expose the front and back of the label to the steam 11 x research source keep the water going at a steady simmer or rolling boil to keep generating steam the steam will gently melt the adhesive backing on many wine labels if you re using a 2 piece pasta pot lower the colander insert into the base then stand the wine bottle up inside the colander unless you re using a colander insert you ll need to manually hold the bottle over the water while it steams to avoid getting it wet peel off the label using a utility knife and oven gloves the glass will be hot after having sat over the steam for a while so make sure you re wearing oven gloves with the tip of a utility knife or razor blade gently lift up one corner of the wine label if it doesn t budge expose the bottle to the steam for another 10 or 15 minutes once it starts to come loose slowly lift off the entire label 12 x research source once the adhesive has softened the label should come off easily in one piece air dry the label on a sheet of parchment paper if the label ends up being slightly damp after having been exposed to the steam allow it to air dry overnight set it on a sheet of parchment paper with the adhesive side up this will allow the glue to harden while the front of the label dries off 13 x research source this is a useful technique to use on labels that you don t want to submerge in water fill a large pot with hot water boil enough water to fill a stockpot about 2 3 of the way up make sure you use enough water to completely cover the entire wine label once you set the bottle into the pot 14 x research source you can use hot water from the tap instead but it might not be as effective as just boiled water submerge the empty uncorked bottle in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes stand up the bottle in the pot full of hot water if necessary add a little more water so that the top of the label is covered by the water leave it to soak for about 10 to 15 minutes or so 15 x research source if desired you can purchase a chlorinated soap from a wine store that s designed to help to dissolve the adhesive be sure to follow the manufacturer s instructions so you use the product correctly remove the bottle from the hot water and dry it off put on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves to provide some grip and protect your hands from the hot water use caution as you lift out the wine bottle as it will be hot dry off the outside of the bottle with a towel 16 x research source peel off the damp label using the edge of a utility knife once the bottle is dry slide the blade of a utility knife underneath one of the corners of the label once it starts to come loose carefully peel up the rest of the label work slowly to avoid tearing the label 17 x research source the hot water soak will have softened up the adhesive so you should be able to preserve the label in one piece be careful not to rub or scratch the damp paper as it will easily get damaged allow the label to air dry overnight set the damp label on a piece of parchment paper face down if you want the adhesive to dry or set it glue side down onto a sheet of regular paper if you d rather mount the label or preserve it in a journal the moist glue will adhere to the paper leave the paper to air dry overnight 18 x research source if the label curls up while it dries you can press it flat within the pages of a heavy book once it s totally dry,Hobbies-and-Crafts

how to identify shark teeth,a trip to the beach can be really fun but even more so when you find a cool shark tooth to bring home you may wonder how you can increase your chances of finding shark teeth at the beach or once you find a tooth you may wonder what kind of shark it came from or how old it is luckily there are ways that you can find these things out,search for teeth at the tide line and the shoreline go to the beach at low tide and look for the line of debris in the sand walk slowly along this tide line as you keep your eyes peeled for teeth if the beach is busy you might have more luck looking right where the waves are crashing into the shoreline so that you can snag teeth before others see them 1 x research source every now and then dig up some of the sand along the tide line and or shoreline and search through it for teeth while teeth can be found on the surface of the sand they re also often found underneath sift through shells and sand to find shark teeth if there are a lot of shells in the areas where you search it might be a good idea to grab a big pile of shells and sort through them scoop up some shells and dig up a little bit of sand that s underneath put the shells and sand into a sifter and shake it then take one object out at a time and observe it to see if it s a tooth a shell or something else 2 x research source while it s possible to find teeth where there aren t a lot of shells and or debris you may have more luck in areas where shells and debris have collected look for dark triangular shapes while shark teeth are subtly unique to each other the teeth that you might find will most likely be black or another similar dark color they will also probably be smaller between about 0 5 inches 1 3 cm and 2 inches 5 1 cm in length and in the shape of a triangle focus on these physical characteristics as you scan the sand and sift through shells 3 x research source identify teeth by their glossy quality shark teeth and seashells can sometimes look very similar to each other if you pick up an object and can t quite tell which one it is hold it up to the sunlight if it s a shell the object will likely have ripples and some iridescence while nearly all shark teeth tend to appear glossy in the light 4 x research source recognize white shark teeth by their broad triangular shape if you have a shark tooth that s flat and in the shape of a wide triangle then you may have a white shark tooth on your hands 5 x research source there should be coarse serrations along the blade of the tooth and it should also be about 1 5 2 5 inches 3 8 6 4 cm long 6 x research source identify tiger shark teeth by their short blades tiger shark teeth blades are only about as long as their roots they can also be identified by the sharp serrations on the shoulders of their blades and also by how deeply notched their blades typically are 7 x research source tiger shark teeth are typically about 1 inch 2 5 cm long but they can sometimes be as long as 1 5 2 inches 3 8 5 1 cm recognize bull shark teeth by their tapering serrations bull shark teeth have blades that are flat and broad with a narrow apex these teeth are usually 1 inch 2 5 cm long or slightly shorter while there are serrations along the entire blade they get smaller and smaller further down the blade 8 x research source identify a lemon shark tooth by its slightly angled blade lemon shark teeth have no serrations and the blade is angled to the side very slightly lemon shark teeth blades are also flat and narrow 9 x research source the average length for lemon shark teeth is about 0 75 inches 1 9 cm 10 x research source spot a sand tiger shark s tooth by its narrowness sand tiger shark teeth have extremely narrow blades that are free of serrations and typically measure about 1 inch 2 5 cm in length 11 x research source this makes them relatively easy to identify they also have very high cusps 12 x research source identify megalodon teeth by their large size a megalodon is a type of shark that has been extinct for thousands of years but it s remembered for its massive size you can typically identify this type of tooth by its size alone because it s so much bigger than other shark teeth as megalodon teeth typically range from 3 5 7 inches 8 9 17 8 cm long 13 x research source you can also identify these by their finely serrated blades and the thin black line that s located between the blade and the root of the tooth 14 x research source identify other shark teeth species by their shapes and sizes shark teeth from different species tend to stand apart from each other in these ways the shape of the tooth is often the most telling as most species have a uniquely angled blade shaped cusp or serration quality that identifies it as that particular species if you think a tooth could ve come from 1 of 2 possible species measure its length and see if it fits more with the size of 1 species or the other 15 x research source for example great hammerhead shark teeth stand out because they have a uniquely square root and serrations from the top to the bottom of the blade that are a consistent size identify fossilized teeth by their dark coloring shark teeth contain oxygen which can react with surrounding minerals to create colors over time fossilized shark teeth have had at least 10 000 years for this oxidation to take effect so they re often black deep red brown grey or another similar dark color 16 x research source this varies based on the environment that the tooth has fossilized in because different sediments contain minerals that create different colors through oxidization 17 x research source shark teeth that are found in areas that contain iron oxide such as parts of new jersey tend to have an orange or red coloring shark teeth found in areas that contain a lot of phosphate such as venice beach florida tend to be black as phosphate is a dense black mineral 18 x research source identify modern teeth by their lighter color modern teeth haven t yet been exposed to the minerals in surrounding sediments for the 10 000 years that it takes to cause oxidation as a result these teeth are typically white and usually appear much like they did when they were in the mouth of the shark they came from 19 x research source find out the species and see if it s extinct try determining the general age of the tooth by observing its anatomy and finding out what kind of species it came from while many shark teeth that you may find can come from sharks like tiger sharks and great white sharks that exist today you could find one that comes from an extinct species if you notice that the anatomy of a tooth matches that of an extinct species the tooth is extremely old 20 x research source the megalolamna paradoxodon is one example of an extinct shark species that you could possibly find the teeth of 21 x research source recognize teeth that are found inland as old while you can certainly find fossilized shark teeth at the beach both modern and fossilized teeth are frequently found in this location if you find a tooth significantly inland then there s a high chance that it s very old because it would take a long time for the tooth to be moved far away from the ocean by the elements 22 x research source for instance if you find a shark tooth in a creek that s 50 miles 80 5 kilometers inland it s probably a fossilized tooth,Hobbies-and-Crafts
how to find pearls,finding a pearl especially in the wild is a rarity however it can be done though it s best if you visit an area known for its commercial pearls if you want to up your odds a little bit consider taking a guided diving tour to find a pearl,order oysters one way to find pearls is to eat oysters in restaurants it is unusual to find a pearl in a restaurant oyster especially one of high value the odds are definitely stacked against you with this method though it can be done 1 x research source in fact edible varieties of oysters generally produce a different type of pearl than pearl oysters 2 x research source but true pearls have very occasionally been found by diners you don t just have to order oysters on the half shell any dish with oysters in it is fair game you can also try buying oysters to eat at home from a fish market to shuck an oyster at home place the slit face up insert a table knife in one end of the slit pushing downward slightly and moving across the opening pull the oyster open to look for a pearl if it doesn t have one you can still enjoy the oyster know what to look for most pearls found in edible oysters aren t worth much or anything they are usually misshapen and especially hard however be on the lookout for round pearls if it is colorful such as purple or orange it can be worth a lot more 3 x research source pearls can come in all sorts of colors such as blue purple orange white pink green and black they can be round oblong egg shaped or irregularly shaped 4 x research source however most edible oysters will produce something closer to a pebble than a pearl 5 x research source don t bite down if you feel something hard when eating oysters try not to chomp down on it for one as noted most pearls found in edible oysters are especially hard and could crack one of your teeth in addition you don t want to swallow it pull it out of your mouth immediately if it looks round smooth and lustrous have it appraised at a jeweler s 6 x research source purchase pearl oysters some companies sell pearl oysters that can be shipped directly to your home these companies generally guarantee that you will have an oyster with a pearl in it find a guided diving tour if you ve never gone pearl diving before it s best to use a guided tour you can find one online or through a travel agency 7 x research source some pearl diving companies let you dive for naturally grown pearls others are part of a farming operation you ll have better luck finding pearls with farming operations but you likely won t get as much diving time 8 x research source in fact some companies guarantee you will find a pearl or they will give you one 9 x research source be a good swimmer to go pearl diving you will need to be able to swim well while you may have the aid of scuba gear in some places you won t either way you need to be able to swim 10 x research source if you don t already know how to swim consider taking swimming lessons from your local parks and recreation department or ymca wear the proper attire the proper attire will depend on where you are for instance in dubai they have you wear long flowing white pants and a matching top provided by the company in that case the idea is to protect you from jellyfish ask the company you are diving with what would be most appropriate 11 x research source take a dive a boat will take you to the diving area in most cases you will need to be able to dive 10 to 15 fifteen feet sometimes the company will provide you with a weight to help you sink more quickly you may be gathering loose oysters 12 x research source or untying strings of oysters from a farm 13 x research source shuck the oysters at the end a trained technician will help you shuck the oysters in some cases they may use a machine to help gently pry the oyster open in that case the oyster will go back in the ocean after the pearl has been removed 14 x research source visit a state with natural pearls in the united states your main options are kentucky lake and tennessee river in tennessee and san angelo for freshwater pearls for saltwater pearls your main option is hawaii 15 x research source while you can find mussels that produce pearls in other areas these are the main states for commercially viable pearls pay the fee in most areas you will need to pay a fee for a permit in tennessee for example license fees are based on whether you are a commercial in state resident 200 in 2016 or commercial out of state resident 1 000 in 2016 you may also get a license as a wholesaler 500 in 2016 employ a diver s down flag when you are in the water you usually must use a diver s flag the flag shows that there is someone under the water in tennessee for instance the law specifies that no boat can go within 50 feet of the flag nor cause wakes withing 200 feet of the flag the only boat that can be within 50 feet is the boat used to dive from dive for pearls like with a guided tour you will likely need to take a boat to the diving area especially if you are diving for saltwater pearls however many freshwater mussels are found in stream beds so when hunting for freshwater pearls you only need to walk along areas of the river mussels can be difficult to find because they are camouflaged to blend in with the sand and silt at the bottom of the river 16 x research source check for mussels in shallow water generally sandy areas are best and you ll be able to find them in rivers lakes and streams 17 x research source many fisherman use waders to wade into the river and gather mussels essentially you wade into the middle of shallow water and feel around in the bottom of the steam for mussels 18 x research source in lakes you can employ similar methods of feeling for mussels but you may need basic diving equipment 19 x research source if the water is not murky you ll be able to see mussels sticking up out of the sand at the bottom 20 x research source shuck your mussels use a dull knife to shuck your oyster place it on a hard surface with the opening up before inserting the knife on one side into the slit on top push across the slit slanting down as you go once you ve done this step you should be able to pull it open and look for your pearl burnish your pearl with table salt and a soft cloth that s a little damp follow local regulations usually the mussels you take will need to be of a certain size in tennessee for instance they lay out the size for each species the easiest way to measure your mussels is to use a ring with an interior that is the specified size then you just see whether the mussel passes through or not for pink heelsplitters and washboards the mussels need to be 4 inches in diameter river pigtoes lake pigtoes maple leafs southerns three ridges and

how to classify rocks,collecting rocks is a fun hobby and being able to classify the rocks into different types makes it even better the three primary classes of rock are sedimentary igneous and metamorphic sedimentary rocks often have fossils and fragments of other particles in the rock igneous rocks are known for having gas bubbles or crystals metamorphic rocks form deep under the earth s surface and these sometimes have distinct layers or bands,check the rock for fossils fossils are imprints that formed in the rock while it was being made these imprints are usually of plants shells or insects generally only sedimentary rocks have fossils 1 x research source look for chunks of different types of rock some sedimentary rocks include chunks or fragments of different rocks the fragments often have contrasting colors and textures making these sedimentary rocks easy to spot you may need to use a magnifier to check the rock as clay and silt fragments are very small 2 x research source chunks and fragments in sedimentary rocks are called clasts these are fragments of other minerals such as clay silt sand or gravel rocks with silt fragments are called siltstone and rocks with fragments of sand are called sandstone some rocks have chunks of gravel and these are called breccia 3 x research source scratch the rock to identify the mineral composition if the rock doesn t have chunks or fragments of other rocks then use your fingernail to scratch the surface a rock that can easily be scratched is most likely gypsum if it is too difficult to scratch the rock then it might be quartz or halite look for crystals in the rock you may have to use a magnifier to see the crystals if they are really small other crystals are large enough to see with the naked eye 4 x research source crystals can form in igneous rock when the magma is underground and it cools sometimes crystals also form when magma erupts and cools on the surface check the rock for gas bubbles or holes look at the surface of the rock to see if you can spot tiny scattered holes this is because gas sometimes gets trapped in igneous rocks as they form 5 x research source in some igneous rocks the holes caused by the bubbles will reach all the way through to the other side 6 x research source check the rock for tiny particles to determine if it is extrusive use a magnifier to see if you can spot different colors or textures on the surface of the rock extrusive rocks form from lava that has flown onto the earth s surface when the lava is exposed to the atmospheric temperatures it cools down very quickly which stops large minerals from forming 7 x research source examine the rock for large particles to determine if it is intrusive intrusive igneous rocks have minerals in the rock are very easy to see these will differ in color and texture and you won t need a magnifier to spot them 8 x research source intrusive igneous rocks are created from magma that has solidified underground large minerals form because it takes a long time for the magma to cool underground look at the band color of the rock igneous rocks that are light in color are called felsic rocks that have both light and dark particles are defined as intermediate dark igneous rocks are called mafic 9 x research source felsic rocks are made up of feldspar and silica quartz mafic rocks are made of magnesium and iron intermediate rocks are both felsic and mafic check for layers some rocks have layers which means that the rock is called a foliated metamorphic rock you will be able to easily see the different layers in the rock other metamorphic rocks don t have layers and these are called non foliated the patterns in metamorphic rocks without layers look random 10 x research source gneiss and schist are common metamorphic rock types that have layers marble and quartzite are metamorphic rocks without layers 11 x research source look at the band color in rocks that have layers metamorphic rocks with dark bands are usually slate while rocks with light and dark bands are usually gneiss you might need to use a magnifier to see the different bands in the rock 12 x research source the bands in the rocks are formed by the temperature of the environment where the rock was formed examine the texture of the rock if it doesn t have layers if the rock doesn t have layers and is black then it is most likely anthracite coal rocks that have ingrained quartz are quartzite if you can see large grains of recrystallized limestone this means that the rock is marble 13 x research source,Hobbies-and-Crafts
