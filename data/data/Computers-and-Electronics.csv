to the username in the comments to find the time when the comment was written scroll until you find the earliest date if the user interacted when the article was published this will be the closest date to publication 4 x research source you can t use this date to cite a website however it can help you gauge when the website was published so you ll have an idea of how old the information is if

how to find your subnet mask,networks are broken up into subnetworks to allow for faster data transfer and easier management routers accomplish this by assigning subnet masks a number that indicates where to look in the ip address to determine the subnetwork 1 x research source in most cases finding the subnet mask on a computer is an easy task other devices present more of a challenge if one prompts you to enter the subnet mask you can usually use the same one as your computer,open command prompt press the windows key and r at the same time to open the command prompt window if this doesn t work click the start button or windows logo in the lower left corner of the screen type command prompt in the search bar and double click the icon that appears you may need to press search first to access the search bar if there is no icon in the lower left move your mouse to the lower right and swipe upward or swipe from the right on a touch screen enter the ipconfig command type the words ipconfig all exactly as they appear with a space in between them hit the enter key windows ipconfig is the program that keeps track of all of your network connections this command will bring up a list with all of your network information find the subnet mask this is located in the section titled ethernet adapter local area connection find the line beginning subnet mask and look across to find your subnet mask 2 x research source most subnet mask numbers begin with a string of 255s such as 255 255 255 0 look through the control panel instead here s another way to find this information navigate to control panel network internet network and sharing center on most modern windows systems click change adapter settings on the left on windows vista click manage network connections instead 3 x research source right click local area connection and select status click details in the window that opens 4 x research source look for your subnet mask click on the system preferences icon on your dock if that icon is not on your dock click on the apple logo on the top left of the screen and select system preferences click the network icon on the system preferences window the network icon looks like a grey ball on most versions of mac os x if you can t find it type network in the search bar on the upper right of the system preferences window select your internet connection from the list on the left click the name with a green dot next to it and the word connected underneath it click advanced if using wifi this is located in the lower right on most other types of network connections you can already see the subnet mask labeled on the right side of your screen select the tcp ip tab in the advanced window mac tcp ip specifies the communication method for accessing the network find your subnet mask this should be clearly labeled subnet mask and begin with a 255 if the only numbers you see are on the lower half of the screen underneath configure ipv6 you are on a local ipv6 only network which does not use subnet masks if you should be connected online try selecting using dhcp from the configure ipv4 drop down menu then pressing renew dhcp lease open a command line if you re not sure how to do this you ll need to find specific instructions for your build of linux you may wish to become more familiar with the command line before you continue as well enter the ifconfig command in the command line window type ifconfig and press enter 5 x research source if nothing happens besides a message saying you need to be root administrator follow these instructions to gain administrator access find the subnet mask this should be labeled mask or subnet mask the number will begin with 255 use the same subnet mark as a computer when you are setting up a smart tv or other device you may be told to input a subnet mask this number is specific to your local network for best results follow the instructions above to find the subnet mask on your computer the same number should work well for your device as well if your device still won t connect leave the information open on your computer refer to it while changing settings on the device if you can t find the information on a computer try entering 255 255 255 0 this is the most common subnet mask for home networks change the ip address if the device still won t go online check the ip address this should be in the same screen where you can set the subnet mask compare it to the ip address of your computer visible wherever you found your computer s subnet mask copy your computer s ip address except for the final number or numbers after the last period choose any higher number instead as long as it is 254 or below add at least 10 since nearby numbers are more likely to be used by additional devices on your network for example if your computer s ip address is 192 168 1 3 set your device s ip address to 192 168 1 100 if you can t find your computer s ip address check your router for a printed label or search online for your router s brand and ip address change the final group of numbers if you can t find any information try 192 168 1 100 or 192 168 0 100 or 192 168 10 100 or 192 168 2 100 set the gateway this should be set to the same gateway value as your computer which is also your router s ip address this will almost always be the same as the device s ip address except with a 1 instead of the final group of numbers for example if any device on your network has an ip address of 192 168 1 3 set the gateway to 192 168 1 1 in any internet browser type http followed by this value if you have the correct gateway you should reach information about your router set the dns use the same dns setting as your computer or the same value as you entered under gateway alternatively search online for public dns for more options contact the manufacturer if your device still won t connect with these settings contact technical support at the company that made the device,Computers-and-Electronics

how to use a digital multimeter,a multimeter also called a volt ohm meter or vom is a device that measures resistance voltage resistance and continuity no matter what you re testing the black test lead will always plug into the com terminal and the red test lead will be the one to move around depending on what you re measuring use the black and red probes to do your measurements turning the multimeter to the correct settings and switching off the circuit s power before testing it,use the voltage setting to measure for ac and dc voltage ac or alternating current voltage is used to measure things you might find around the house like wall sockets microwaves or pumps dc direct current voltage is mostly used to measure batteries both of these types of voltage are measured very similarly with only slight differences in how to get your reading dc voltage is common in cars and other vehicles and is often used during auto repairs plug the test leads into the com and v terminals the black test lead will always be plugged into the terminal that s labeled com for common the red test lead should be plugged into the terminal labeled v for voltage since this is what you re testing 1 x research source both ac and dc voltage are measured using the test leads in this setting move the dial to v if you re measuring ac voltage use the ac voltage setting if you re measuring voltage in a wall socket the washer or dryer tv or any other electrical system in the home look for the v with a wave sign next to it and move your dial to this area 2 x research source switch the dial to v to measure dc voltage dc or direct current voltage measures batteries dc voltage is represented by a v with a horizontal line next to it and a dotted line under the horizontal one look for the dc voltage area on your multimeter and move the dial to this section 3 x research source if you accidentally measure ac voltage on the dc setting or vice versa it won t harm the multimeter as long as the meter s voltage range is set at its highest set the dial to the next number up from the voltage you re measuring for example if you re measuring a 1 5v battery you would move the dial to 2v because this is the next number up that s displayed on the multimeter if you re not sure of the voltage of the thing you re measuring set the dial to a higher number you can always move it to a lower number to get a better reading 4 x research source if you re measuring a battery remember that your dial will be set to a number in the dc voltage area if you re measuring the electrical current in a wall socket using ac voltage you might set the dial to 200v in the ac section if the socket is 110v place the wire probes on the positive and negative circuit parts to measure dc voltage the black probe should be placed on the negative side of the battery while the red probe is placed on the positive side hold the probes on their corresponding ends using your hands making sure the probe is touching the metal section of each positive and negative end 5 x research source if you re not sure which end is positive and which is negative try putting a probe on each end and seeing what the multimeter says if it s showing a negative number your positive and negative are switched put the probes in the correct wall socket slots to measure ac voltage to measure the voltage in a wall socket the black probe goes in the bigger slot and the red probe goes in the smaller slot right next to it 6 x research source to avoid getting shocked keep your fingers away from the tips of the probes when you re putting them near the wall socket keep the probes from coming in contact with one another look at the digital multimeter reading to see the voltage once your probes are where they should be you ll get a reading on the multimeter telling you the voltage of what you re testing look at the digital screen to find the reading and take note of it if desired 7 x research source looking at your reading will tell you whether or not the voltage you re measuring is average or not for example if you measure the wall socket and the multimeter reads 100v this is below the average of 120v letting you know this wall socket s voltage is low use the resistance setting to measure resistors after disconnecting them to measure resistance the multimeter sends a small amount of current to the object you re testing and gives you its resistance in ohms make sure you disconnect the thing you re measuring so it s not linked to a power source 8 x research source if you don t turn off the power you could damage your multimeter measure the resistance in things like switches or a motor insert the black test lead in com and the red test lead in the ω terminal stick the black test lead s plug into the com terminal the red test lead s plug goes into the terminal labeled ω which is the symbol for ohms the unit that resistance is measured in 9 x research source the ω sign is likely linked with the v sign meaning the terminal to measure ohms and voltage is the same locate the area represented by the resistance sign look for the ω symbol on your multimeter s dial area which will show the numbers for resistance twist the dial until it s in this section 10 x research source set the dial to a number above the resistance that s expected to do this it helps to know the rough amount of resistance of the thing you re testing for example if you re testing a wire the number will be closer to zero because wires don t have much resistance while a piece of wood is much more resistant twist the dial to a number more than the expected resistance 11 x research source for example if you re measuring the resistance of something you think will have 1 000 ohms you would set the dial to 2 000 the ω values will range from 200 to 2 million ohms depending on the specific type of multimeter if you re not sure what the expected resistance will be set the dial to a high number and keep twisting it down until you get a precise reading place the probes on the resistor to test the amount of resistance touch the tips of the probes onto each end of the resistor look at the multimeter s digital screen to see the reading which will tell you the amount of resistance in ohms 12 x research source if your multimeter is just reading 1 you might need to increase the value of ohms measured by turning the dial so your reading can be more specific write down the reading if needed noting the correct unit use the continuity option to test whether wires are still working or not if you re not sure whether a certain cord or wire still has a good connection you can test this by measuring its continuity this will test the connection between two points in a circuit 13 x research source this is a good way to see if cables are broken internally or not check to make sure the device you re testing isn t powered unplug or remove the batteries from the device you want to test if the device is still being powered you won t be able to test for continuity 14 x research source insert the black plug in com and the red plug in the ω terminal the terminal that holds the red plug should be the one labeled as v ω or even the sign for continuity which looks like a sound wave place the black and red plugs in their corresponding terminals so you re ready to measure continuity 15 x research source set the dial to the picture that looks like a sound wave instead of having a range of numbers in its area the continuity option will only show the one sound wave twist the dial until it s pointing directly at the continuity sound wave to be sure it s on the right setting 16 x research source attach the probes to the ends of the wire you re testing place the black probe on one end of the wire and the red probe on the other make sure that the probes are both touching the wire ends at the same time so the multimeter will work properly 17 x research source listen for a beep to signal that there s a strong connection as soon as the two probes are touching the wires ends you should hear a beep if the wire is working well if you don t hear a beep this means you have a short in the wire 18 x research source if you have a cut or burnt wire your wire might have a short the beep is telling you that there s almost no resistance between the two points find the current of circuits by measuring in amps amps short for ampere is the unit of electrical current this will tell you how much electricity is flowing through a certain circuit 19 x research source measuring the amperage of something is useful because it can tell you whether that object is pulling too much energy draining your electricity place the black test lead in com and the red test lead in the correct amps option the black plug goes into the com terminal your multimeter likely has two terminals for amps one for currents up to 10 amps 10a and one that measures up to roughly 300 milliamps 300ma if you re not sure of the range of amperage you re measuring place your red plug in amps instead of milliamps 20 x research source you can switch to milliamps for a more precise reading if necessary as long as you re measuring something under the max amperage 10a then your multimeter will work the red plug will either go in amps or milliamps labeled with a or ma locate the amps setting and turn the multimeter s dial to it look for the a that stands for amps twist the dial on the multimeter until it s on this setting to measure the current 21 x research source some multimeters have two a s one for alternating current used for residential power and is represented by the wave sign and one for direct current used in batteries and wires and is represented by a horizontal line with a dotted line under it direct current is the one that s most used for this reading turn the dial to 10a for the best reading cut the wires using a wire cutter this is called breaking the circuit and it turns your multimeter into an ammeter which measures current use wire cutters to cut the wire you re testing in half if your wire has insulation on it strip off roughly 0 5 in 1 3 cm of insulation towards the end of each cut using the wire cutters 22 x research source if you don t break the circuit by splicing the wires you could blow a fuse and won t get an accurate reading in some instances avoid cutting the wire by disconnecting one wire and touching the ammeter to the bare wire end as well as the pole of the circuit splice in the multimeter to give you an accurate reading hold one probe to one split end of wire and the other probe to the other split end use alligator clips to hold the probes and wires together so your hands are free 23 x research source splicing in the multimeter means that you re connecting the multimeter to the current going directly through the wires read the number on the multimeter to tell you the amps or milliamps when the wires are properly touching the red and black probes the multimeter should come up with an amperage reading write this number down so you don t forget it if desired 24 x research source,Computers-and-Electronics

key to a good recording is to ensure that the entire frame is filled with the tv image try to position the camera in such as way that it is looking directly at the tv and that the frame is filled by the tv image move the camera a little closer so that the edges of the tv are just barely cut off this will ensure that the entire frame is full make sure that you aren t pointed at an angle or you ll likely pick up some glare avoid using the zoom if your video camera or smartphone uses digital zoom avoid using it for filming your gameplay digital zoom will result in a blurry final video and you need as much clarity as possible when filming this way connect the audio to the camera if possible if you re using a camcorder you may be able to route the game audio through the camcorder s input you ll need a converter for the console s audio cable so that it can plug into the input or line in option on the camcorder this isn t possible on most smartphones another possibility with a camcorder is setting up a microphone next to your tv speaker to pick up the game audio more clearly dim the lights make sure that no lights are shining directly onto the tv screen you don t want to make the room completely dark or the tv image will glow too much as long as lights aren t pointing directly at the tv screen or camera you should be good use a tripod or other stabilizer the worst thing you can do for clarity is to try to hold the camera while the game plays your camera needs to be absolutely steady or it will be very hard to see the gameplay use a tripod if possible if you don t have a tripod set the camera or phone on a level surface and stabilize it with books or other heavy objects sit to the side while playing when the screen is dark you may appear in the tv reflection if you are sitting directly in front sit off to the side while recording so that you don t get caught in the reflection transfer the finished video to your computer for editing and uploading once you re finished recording transfer the video to your computer so that you can edit anything out that you don t want in the video this is usually useful to cut out the setup process or to remove boring parts since the sound recording probably wasn t very good you may want to replace the sound completely with a soundtrack after you re finished making your edits you can upload the video to youtube or keep it on your computer,Computers-and-Electronics

how to use satellite internet,this wikihow teaches you how to install and use satellite internet in your home or mobile location satellite internet is often the only option for people living in remote rural areas in which cable companies don t offer service keep in mind that satellite internet can be erratic so large bandwidth actions such as streaming hd video or playing online video games may be impossible during certain times in the day,consider your options depending on your geographic location you may have several different choices for satellite internet service providers each will most likely come with their fair share of pros and cons so find as many options as possible 1 x research source the main two providers in north america are viasat and hughesnet compare download and upload speeds ultimately the quality of your satellite internet will depend on your service s speed compare the available services upload and download speeds to each other whichever service is faster will usually be the better choice check reviews for your selected service look up online customer reports regarding the service s performance if you see generally favorable reviews the service is probably fine keep in mind that some customers will undoubtedly leave negative reviews due to inconsistent service outages during certain conditions e g weather or the high price point when compared to cable internet all three of these problems are inherent satellite internet issues so take such reviews with a grain of salt sign up for a satellite internet subscription once you ve determined the service you want to use sign up for it to select a plan and enter your payment information you can usually do this online though you can usually also call the service provider instead buy a modem if one isn t included if your satellite internet service doesn t include a modem purchase one that supports satellite internet your satellite internet subscription should include a dish see if installation services are available many satellite internet services will install your dish for you if you re in an area that supports this allow a professional to install your dish instead of doing it yourself if you have to install the dish in variable locations e g a boat or an rv you may have to take care of the installation yourself adjust the dish to point toward the equator since the satellites that transmit your internet are positioned directly over the earth s equator you should not have any obstructions that prevent you from having an optimal connection have your satellite dish installed in an open area away from trees and similar obstructions for example if you live in north america place the dish on the southern most tip of your roof or south of any tall trees so it can point toward the equator anchor the satellite dish to your roof using the hardware that comes with your satellite dish screw the base of the dish into a flat part of your roof the dish should have a clear unobstructed view of the sky make sure the connections are tight and don t install your dish in a loose or unstable section of roof if you have a balcony or similarly proportioned part of your house that has a clear view of the sky over the equator you can use it to mount your dish instead attach coaxial cables to your dish many dishes use two coaxial cables to connect to your internet hardware but your dish may only use one when attaching the coaxial cables to the dish you should see an in port and an out port on the dish consider marking the other ends of your coaxial cables to correspond with these ports you ll need to know which is which when connecting them to your modem secure the coaxial cables you ll usually use staples or hose ties to anchor the coaxial cables to your roof be sure to keep the cables away from sharp objects and secure them as tightly as possible you don t want the cables to come loose during a storm depending on your home you may need to drill a hole through which you can thread the coaxial cables before you can use the cables in your home make sure you have the necessary equipment before attempting to connect to satellite internet you ll need to have the following items available installed satellite dish satellite internet capable modem ethernet cable power source position your computer your computer should be close to both your modem and your dish s coaxial cable s most dish coaxial cables are under 125 feet in length so you might have to position your modem accordingly plug the modem into a power source using the modem s power cable attach it to an electrical outlet near both your computer and the dish s coaxial cable attach the modem to the satellite dish depending on your dish you will have either one coaxial cable or two coaxial cables to attach to the modem 2 x research source one cable plug the cable into the modem s coaxial port two cables plug the in cable into the sat in coaxial port then plug the out cable into the sat out port connect your computer to the modem plug one end of the ethernet cable into the back of the modem then plug the other end of the cable into your computer s ethernet slot if you re using a mac which doesn t have an ethernet slot you can buy an ethernet to thunderbolt adapter for this step wait for your computer to establish an internet connection as long as your dish is currently receiving a signal from its pertinent satellite you should be able to begin browsing within a minute of connecting your computer to the modem use a wireless router if you re connecting more than one item to the internet you ll need to plug your modem into a wireless router via an ethernet cable and then use each item s wi fi menu to connect to the router using a wireless router isn t recommended unless absolutely necessary since satellite internet is already patchy under normal circumstances using a wireless router may further dilute your signal,Computers-and-Electronics

how to learn electronics,electronics is the science of controlling electricity so it s a very important field that is fortunately less difficult to learn than you may think you can start right away by reading up on electrical currents and circuits for a more hands on approach order building kits or make your own circuits with enough studying you may be able to make your own electronic gadgets someday,read books to learn the fundamentals of electronics visit your local library or a bookstore to begin reading about electronics even older books have a lot of information about electrical circuits and how they work use it to study the basics before you begin building your own circuits 1 x research source try books like make electronics the art of electronics or foundations of analog and digital electronic circuits for more resources search online for informative websites and digital book copies download a phone application to study electrical engineering search your phone s play store to find a number of informative hands on apps some apps teach you the basics of electronics while others let you design your own circuit board using a touchscreen 2 x research source for example try electronics basics or electrodroid study how a current travels along a wire an electrical current consists of electrons which are the negatively charged particles in atoms in a current the electrons flow from a negative source such as a battery terminal then it flows around the circuit and returns to the positive terminal 3 x research source you can think of it like a faucet when the faucet turns on water is pushed through until it reaches the end of the pipe read about the voltage in a circuit voltage is a measurement of the force needed to make a current flow through a circuit in a circuit the electrons accumulate near the battery s negative terminal energy is needed to get the current to flow through the circuit and this measurement is the voltage think of it as pressure in a water tank when water is drained from the tank the pressure goes down and less water flows out study the resistance factor of different objects resistance slows the current in a circuit different materials inhibit electricity more than others you will need a stronger electrical current to pass through insulation than a conductive material like metal this increases the voltage for example imagine water pipes of different sizes water faces more resistance flowing through the smaller pipe due to the lack of space read circuit diagrams to understand the notation electrical diagrams and schematics use symbols to denote components before you can copy one to build your own circuit find out what the symbols mean search online for a list of symbols used as shorthand in diagrams 4 x research source the straight lines are wires a battery is represented by a sign followed by a long and short straight line diodes for example are represented by triangles resistors are represented by squares or jagged lines measure an electrical current with a multimeter a multimeter is a handy way to measure the different forces that make up an electrical charge it s helpful to have one on hand to test the current in any electrical circuit get one that measures the current voltage and resistance 5 x research source the current is the flow of electricity in a circuit it is measured in amperes a current s voltage measured in volts is the pressure pushing the current along the circuit resistance indicates how much the circuit resists the flow of electricity it is measured in ohms limit an electrical current with a resistor resistors are small tubes on wires they don t actively do anything but they are important in limiting the electrical current without a resistor the electrical current can become too strong and ruin other components 6 x research source for example if you attach an led light to a circuit without a resistor the light can burn out store electricity with a capacitor capacitors are the opposite of resistors instead of limiting the flow they encourage it by storing a little bit of electricity this way if the power is disrupted the circuit continues to work 7 x research source for example if you unplug your computer the capacitors will ensure the electrical current runs smoothly from the battery control electrical currents using diodes and transistors these components have and terminals that help conduct electricity when activated electricity flows through one end and out the other diodes have 2 ends while transistors have 3 8 x research source diodes are used to make an electrical current flow in 1 direction only transistors are like switches that change the direction of a current practice cutting and stripping wires for basic electrical work you will need a wire cutter and a wire stripper from a hardware store to do this cut the wires to the length first then strip about 1 4 in 0 64 cm of insulation off the ends before connecting them to components to work with the wire hold the exposed ends against the components or tape them in place if you use a breadboard simply push the exposed end into the hole when you first begin you do not need to learn how to solder read about how wires of different colors are used electrical wires are generally all copper however they are cased in different colors of plastic to distinguish their uses always connect like wires together use black and red wires to power your circuits 9 x research source black wires are the main current conductors in a circuit red wires are secondary carriers blue and yellow wires are uncommon but are used to carry electricity in complex circuits white and gray wires are considered neutral because they conduct unused electricity green wires are grounding wires which bring the current to the ground for safety build a circuit using a circuit diagram search for circuit diagrams online to find a few simple ones you can attempt to build on your own read the diagram to figure out what components you need then build the circuit so it looks like the diagram it will help give you an idea of how a circuit works 10 x research source it is best to start with a smaller circuit pick one with few branching lines and available components like a battery and light bulb make a closed loop using a light bulb gather 2 copper wires a fresh battery and a light bulb set the components on a table then hold the wires to connect the battery terminals to the bulb s metal base until the light bulb lights up 11 x research source you can light the bulb with only these components the electrical current flows from the negative terminal to the positive one passing through the light bulb along the way seeing this closed loop make your light bulb come to life can give you a better understanding of how electricity moves in a circuit purchase a kit for practice projects go online to find a variety of beginner kits for electronics there are

how to find amps,an ampere shortened frequently to amp is a unit of measure that is used for electrical current current is the measure of electrons that flow through a given circuit 1 x research source this information can be very useful in the event you are trying to connect a tool or appliance to the mains which is the term used to describe the ac current that flows directly from an electric company s generating station to your household 2 x research source 3 x research source,apply the conversion formula for dc electricity electric current represented by i which is measured in amps a can be found by dividing power in watts w by the volts v of voltage this is represented by the following formula i a p w v v 4 x research source or more simply amps watts volts understand power factor pf for ac electricity problems power factor is a ratio representing the real power used to do work and the apparent power supplied to an alternating current circuit a value ranging from 0 to 1 therefore power factor is your real power p in watts divided by your apparent power s measured in volt amper va or pf p s 5 x research source calculate apparent power to find your power factor apparent power can be calculated by s vrms x irms where s is the apparent power in volt amper va vrms is your root mean square voltage and irms is your root mean square current both which can be found by solving the following vrms vpeak 2 in volts v irms ipeak 2 in amperes a use the power factor for single phase ac electricity your single phase current will be represented by i and measured in amps a and can be calculated by dividing the real power p measured in watts w divided by a power factor pf multiplied by the root mean square rms voltage as measured in volts v this is represented by i a p w pf x v v or more simply amps watts pf x volts make sure your current is dc dc electricity or direct current electricity is electrical current that flows in a single direction if your circuit is powered by a battery the current used will be dc 6 x research source in most countries the electricity provided by utility mains is ac current also called alternating current 7 x research source ac current can be converted to dc current but only through the use of a transformer a rectifier and a filter 8 x research source determine the path of electricity to take the reading of the amperage of your circuit you will need to tie your ammeter into your circuit follow the positive and negative ends of your battery and the connecting wires to find the circuit path test your circuit if there is a break in the circuit or a flaw with your battery your ammeter will likely not be able to gauge or will not gauge accurately the current of your circuit turn on your circuit to see if it is functioning normally switch off your circuit for some simple circuits this might require removing the battery completely with more powerful batteries there is a possibility that you could be shocked so take care to make sure the circuit is off if you are unsure use insulated rubber gloves to prevent getting shocked tie in the positive end of your ammeter you ammeter should have come with two leads one red and one black the red lead is your positive end and the black your negative take the wire leading from the positive end of your battery and tie the end leading away from your battery to the positive end of your ammeter 9 x research source the ammeter will not interrupt the flow of electricity but as current flows through the meter it will measure the current causing a reading to display complete the circuit with the negative lead of your ammeter take the black lead from your ammeter and use it to complete the circuit you have just broken clamp the lead onto the location where the wire you have tied to your positive lead would have fed into its destination in the circuit 10 x research source turn on your circuit this might simply mean reinstalling your battery but when you do so your device should turn on and your ammeter should read the current in either amps a or milliamps ma for smaller current devices 11 x research source familiarize yourself with the concept of ohm s law ohm s law is a electrical principle that establishes a relationship between the voltage and current of a conductor 12 x research source ohm s law is represented by the formulas v i x r r v i and i v r with the letter terms defined as v the potential difference between two points r the resistance i the current flowing through the resistance 13 x research source determine the voltage of your circuit if your circuit runs on a 9 volt battery you already have part of the equation you can find the specific voltage of the battery you are using by checking the packaging in which it came or doing a quick online search most common cylindrical batteries aaa through d provide approximately 1 5 volts when fresh 14 x research source find the resistors in your circuit you will need to know what kind of resistor is part of your circuit and how much resistance it is creating to the electricity flowing through it since each circuit will be different some simple circuits may not even have resistors you will have to investigate your circuit and locate the resistors for your unique case and their resistance in ohms ω the wiring your electricity flows through will also have resistance this will likely be negligible unless the wiring is very poorly manufactured damaged or your circuit conducts electricity over a long distance the formula for resistivity is as follows resistance resistivity x length area 15 x research source apply ohm s law due to the fact that battery voltage is applied to the circuit entirely to approximate the current of your circuit you will need to divide the total voltage by each resistors resistance with resistance being measured in ohms ω your resulting answer will be the current i in amps a solved with the following calculation v r1 v r2 v r3 where v represents the total voltage and r represents a resistors resistance in ohms 16 x research source,Computers-and-Electronics

how to build your own variable bench power supply using an atx power supply,are you looking to build your own high wattage power supply are you looking to build it without having to spend money bench power supplies can cost you up to 250 dollars this article will teach you how to build your own variable power supply using an atx power supply from a computer this comes in handy for students who are working on little projects at home and need a constant power source for their projects this power supply will be able to give you a constant 5vdc 12vdc 12vdc and 1 2vdc 24vdc variable regulated voltage supply on an average everything should cost about 50 dollars not including shipping charges but it is still way cheaper then those 250 dollar supplies,unplug the power cord from the back of the computer make sure your computer is turned off first cut off the connectors leave a few inches of wire on the connectors so that you can use them later on for other projects open up the power supply unit by removing the screws connecting the top and the bottom of the psu case bundle wires of the same colors together the color code for the wires is red 5v black ground 0v white 5v not used yellow 12v blue 12v orange 3 3v not used except if you have a brown wire in your supply purple 5v standby not used gray power is on output and green turn dc on input start by drilling holes using a dremel tool or drill to the size of the banana jack post you are going to use also drill a hole for the led and also cut out square piece where the lcd will go and also drill room for a potentiometer with knob connect all the pieces together connect one of the red wires to the power resistor connect all the remaining red wires to the red binding posts connect one of the black wires to the other end of the 10 ohm power resistor one black wire to a resistor 330 ohm attached to the cathode shorter lead of the led and the other end of the led anode connected to the gray wire all the remaining black wires to the black binding post connect the 12vdc wires to the desired post but leave one wire left alone so that you can use for variable voltage the 12 vdc to desired post the excess piece of wire cut and save for variable voltage section variable voltage binding should be left alone at this point and nothing should be soldered to it note some power supplies might have a brown sensing wire and or a pink wire if you have a brown wire solder it to the 3 3v orange wire and cut the rest out since you won t need to use them and if you have a pink wire solder it to the red wire please also notice the rubber grommets in the picture that are at the binding post these are to be put on first then put on the nuts because this is to prevent metal nuts from making contact with the metal case so there for no shorting all the other binding posts together build the voltage regulator circuit using the components gathered build the following circuit on a circuit board but solder wires to the potentiometer to make it out of circuit by that i mean only the wires are to be attached to the pc board rather then the actual pot being soldered this is because we are attaching the potentiometer to the case so that we can use it as a knob to turn it to adjust the voltage we want note that the way you will power up the circuit is using those 12vdc wires and 12 vdc wires attach build circuit board with some kind of liquid adhesive to the case so that it sticks to the side somewhere use hot glue to paste it attach potentiometer to drilled hole in case and paste it with the hot glue attach v regulated wire out of the pc board onto the last empty post on your supply case and solder it onto it this will be your regulated voltage coming out attach lcd voltmeter to case and then hook up power to the lcd using 12vdc supply from the bindings and hook up to ground and then hook up the input to the regulated post and the output to the ground post using this lcd will tell you what your regulated voltage out is from that post this regulator can regulate voltages from 1 2vdc to 24vdc do a check following the checklist in the tips section to make sure everything is connected correctly and everything is cleaned correctly and please read tips so that you can follow things more clearly once finished power up the power supply using switch in the back of the supply and led should turn on along with fan and there should be no problems,Computers-and-Electronics
how to refurbish a computer,if you have an old computer sitting around that does not work it doesn t have to stay that way you can repair it and get it working again and upgrade it using the following steps,look at it yes just look at the computer look at it from every angle and ask yourself about it on the top is there any damage to the case on both sides is there any damage to the case is there a fan on the left side is the fan broken on the back what ports does this computer have are they all on the motherboard or are some expansions is there a psu on the front what disk drives do i see is there any obvious damage to the usb ports on the front of the case if there are any try to power it on find a power cord and plug it in power it on and observe if it doesn t power on at all something could be wrong in the case if it powers on and beeps something could be wrong in the case if it powers on and disks whine it s probably fine so far unplug it and open the case even if it had no problems in step 2 open the case you need to do a few things in here if it didn t power on at all look at the power connectors from the psu to motherboard if they re connected properly then there s probably something wrong with the psu or motherboard and unless you have replacements available this computer isn t worth it if not connect them properly look at the disk drive connectors are they upside down is a drive s pin setting not correct correct it clean it using compressed air dust out the case dust the motherboard cards disk drives power supply any fans especially the cpu fan on the motherboard and the case around everything remember to hold the fans while cleaning them so you don t break them look for broken parts if the cd rom drive does not work remove it if the sound card is broken remove it if the graphics card is broken remove it and get another if the cmos battery needs replacement replace it replace what you removed if possible or necessary if there were broken ram it s especially important that you replace them if the hard disk was faulty it s also important however if the 56k modem wasn t working you probably don t need to worry about it as you will probably upgrade in the next step don t replace anything you ll be upgrading upgrade if things can be upgraded upgrade them upgrade the computer as far as possible upgrade ram hard disk s if you can upgrade from cd rom to dvd and if there was a 56k modem upgrade it to gigabit ethernet or a wi fi card etc read build a computer for instructions on working inside the case make sure it works make sure all the above steps have worked power it on and make sure you can boot to bios and can configure all of the hard disks with an exception to some computers such as the compaq deskpro 2000 which do not allow you to access the bios directly install an operating system use a modern operating system for better features and security 1 gb of ram minimum windows 7 512mb of ram minimum ubuntu windows xp and windows vista 256mb of ram minimum xubuntu 128mb of ram minimum lubuntu install software not especially important but installing software can make it more useful to you or make it more appealing to buyers if you re selling it include some stuff find at least a power cord keyboard mouse and maybe a monitor and include them include whatever you have left from when you bought it if you don t need it if you have more try including speakers printers a modem a joystick software disks etc if you re selling it set a reasonable price a good computer from the mid to late 90 s could probably sell for anything between 10 and 50 find out how much you spent on it then add your price for labor so say you spent 5 hours working on this computer at 2 an hour and spent 15 on it in all including buying the computer unless you are the original owner and you want to add an extra 5 adding them together would be 30 so sell your computer for that but be sure it s worth it no one wants to buy a computer with only 16 megabytes of ram running windows 3 1 for 30 if you re not selling it use it the only way that all that work will be worth it is if you use it so sit down and play a few old games run some older software that was rejected by windows 7 give it to your kids use it as a router take it to school with you etc,Computers-and-Electronics

how to install ribbon cable,ribbon cables also known as multi wire planar cables are flat cables with multiple cords fixed together they re generally considered obsolete these days but you may occasionally find them inside some tvs laptops gaming systems and printers replacing a ribbon cable is deceptively simple but you may need to attach a new connector if the cable doesn t slide directly into a clip on your electronic device also be sure to install the new ribbon cable the same direction and way the old cable was installed,get a replacement ribbon cable designed for your specific electronic device ribbon cables are not universal and you must purchase a replacement from the manufacturer of your tv printer or computer measure the width of the cable to determine the size you need and use the color or pattern on the cable itself to find a matching cable 1 x research source ribbon cables are not particularly common these days although you do find them in some sleeker electronics like gaming systems and flat screen tvs since they save space if you re working on a printer older tv or some other electronic though you may not be able to find a replacement ribbon a replacement ribbon cable shouldn t cost more than 15 ribbon cables are all installed the same way but the cables themselves come in hundreds of different sizes and shapes you cannot use a third party cable to replace the ribbon cable on your specific device it must come from the original manufacturer make sure your replacement cable comes with any necessary connectors look at the end of the old ribbon cable if the cable locks directly into a flat clip you do not need a connector if the cable slides into a plastic or metal piece that connects to the clip though be sure to get a ribbon cord with the connector you need only purchase the replacement from the manufacturer 2 x research source there are thousands of these connectors so it s important to get an exact replacement from the manufacturer these connectors typically look like 1 3 in 2 5 7 6 cm long rectangular pieces that connect the cable to a port most replacement cables will come with the connector you need it may also come pre installed on the cable in some cases you ll need to install it yourself though note the orientation of the old cable to keep installation simple ribbon cables generally look different from one another but there s usually something on the cable to let you know which way you install it look for a colored strip or a symbol near the top of the cable to show you which side is up if there isn t anything on the cable pay attention to the order of the colored cords to put your new ribbon cable in the exact same way 3 x research source some cables will have up or and arrow printed on the cable to show you which direction and orientation the cable should be installed flip the cable clip up by hand to remove the old cable at the end of the ribbon cable where it connects to the electronic there is a horizontal strip of plastic with little rivets sticking out of it this is the cable clip put the tip of your index finger in the middle of these rivets and gently pull it upwards apply light pressure and pull gently to unlock the clip slide the old cable out of the clip 4 x research source this process only applies to ribbon cables that do not have a connector on the end if you don t have a rectangular piece of plastic or metal on the end of the cable itself you do not have a connector slide the new ribbon underneath the cable clip take your replacement ribbon cable and turn it so that it s facing the same direction as the old cable with the colors laying the exact same way with the clip unlocked lower the end of the cable underneath the clip slide the cable through the base of the clip using the horizontal slot near the base of the panel that the clip is attached to 5 x research source this is typically pretty easy you can see the opening where the cable slides in just by looking at the base of the clip push the ribbon cable flush with the guide on the opposite side push the cable through the clip until the tip of the cable pops out on the other side keep sliding the cable through until it hits the small vertical lip this is the guideline for the cable and the end of the cable must rest flush against the lip adjust the cable as needed until the end of the ribbon cable matches the guide line 6 x research source this may sound odd but if there s no guideline just push the cable to the other side and let it sit anywhere that it fits when you install a ribbon cable there are pins on the clip that puncture the cords to form an electrical connection you can theoretically install the clip on any part of the ribbon cable close the cable clip by hand to finish attaching the ribbon cable put your finger on the rivets you used to pry the cable clip off lower the rivets down towards the side that they originally rested press the clip down gently until it clicks into place the pins underneath the clip will puncture the ribbon cable and create an electrical connection between the cable and the electronic component 7 x research source install the other end of the cable with a clip or new panel most of the time you merely need to run the cable to another cable clip on your electronic device to attach the other end of the clip repeat these steps by popping the second clip up and sliding the other end of the cable into the slot before closing it if the cable runs to another panel or electronic device attach the clip before screwing or assembling the new portion of the device 8 x research source on a tv this cable typically runs from the screen to the motherboard on a computer these cables connect the screen and keyboard to the motherboard you usually don t need to install new components for these repairs on a printer or gaming system the ribbon clip often connects two panels together to power up buttons attach both ends of the cable using your clips before screwing in or assembling the device pry the old connector out of the port to remove the old cable if there is a piece of thin plastic wrapped over the connector and clip slide it off by hand or with a small screwdriver then try pulling the connector out of the clip that attaches it to your electronic if it sticks a little don t pry it out instead pull the ribbon out of the connector and leave the actual connector attached to the clip slide the old cable out of the connector or clip 9 x research source do not rip the connector if it won t come out of the port some connectors are built into the machine and you actually unlock the cable by pushing a button or prying a cover out of the connector itself 10 x research source refer to the instruction manual for your tv printer gaming system or motherboard if you can t figure out how to remove the connector crimp the connector on the end of the cable if it isn t preassembled if you need to add a new connector to the cable take the 2 halves of the connector and slide them over the end of the cable so that the edge of the ribbon cable sticks out 1 4 1 2 in 0 64 1 27 cm past the connector line the edges of the 2 halves up so that the sides are flush with one another push the 2 halves together by squeezing them to drive the pins through the cords in the cable and attach the connector 11 x research source the pins that stick out the end of the connector must be pointing away from the main body of the ribbon cable there is often a little arrow on the 2 halves of the connector showing you which direction the connector needs to face the connector comes in 2 halves that fit together using pegs so long as the 2 halves are lined up over the cable and the pins are sticking out you can push the 2 pieces together to attach them to the ribbon cable slide the new ribbon cable into the connector or attach the connector itself if the connector is still in the clip orient the new ribbon cable to slide into the old connector turn it so the colors and pins line up with the old cable gently slide the cable into the connector until it clicks if the old connector came out slide the connector into the cable clip so that the prongs on the clip slide into the connector 12 x research source if you re attaching a connector you should hear the connector click into the clip if you slide the ribbon cable into the connector just line the end of the ribbon up with the bottom of the connector and slide it back into the clip attach the other end of the cable to a clip or your second connector if there s a connector on the other end of the ribbon cable connection simply repeat these steps to install the other end of the cable if there isn t a second connector flip the cable clip up by hand and slide the bare ribbon cable underneath to attach it you may need to install a new panel or electrical component depending on the nature of the repair 13 x research source in a computer you re likely attaching the ribbon cable from the motherboard to your keyboard or screen each end will have a separate connector on a gaming device or printer you will likely need to screw 2 panels together on your device to finish installing the cable,Computers-and-Electronics

are a few simple tools and some patience once you know the right process then you ll be able to remove an old car stereo like a pro,disconnect the car battery to avoid a shock or short disconnecting the battery is an important safety precaution pop the hood and find the battery unscrew the nut on the negative terminal first and pull the wire off store it safely on one side of the hood then unscrew the positive terminal and move it to the other side of the hood make sure the positive terminal doesn t touch any metal parts of the car or it ll produce a spark 1 x research source car batteries commonly have a red clip on the positive terminal and a black clip on the negative terminal if the clips aren t color coded look for the or symbols never let the positive and negative wires touch remove any screws or bolts around the trim the trim is the plastic border around the stereo on some cars the stereo trim is just clipped on but others might have screws or bolts holding it on check around the border of the trim for anything attaching it to the dashboard unscrew the bolts or screws to free the trim 2 x research source if there are bolts or screws they might be near the bottom of the stereo trim so they re hidden from view keep track of any screw or bolts you remove so you can reattach the trim later on pop off the stereo trim with a flathead screwdriver whether the trim was attached with screws or not you can remove it the same way insert a flathead screwdriver under the trim and gently work around it to loosen it pull the trim off when it pops free 3 x research source if the trim is stuck you may have missed a screw or bolt double check and remove anything holding the trim down be careful when you re removing the trim if you crack it it might be expensive to replace pry the dashboard covering off if you have a newer car newer cars and suvs make it a bit more difficult to remove the stereo and might cover it with a whole dashboard panel instead of just a simple trim luckily this is easy to remove as well find the edge of the panel and insert a plastic prybar into the space work the prybar around the panel until it pops off then pull it off to reveal the stereo 4 x research source on some suvs the panel continue down to cover the cup holders this doesn t change the removal process just keep working around the panel with the prybar until it comes off 5 x research source do not use a screwdriver or metal tool to remove the dashboard panel this can crack the plastic and you ll need an expensive replacement you can get a plastic prybar from an auto parts store locate the slots on either side of the stereo car stereos are held in by 2 clips 1 on each side you can access them by inserting thin tools into the slots on both sides of the stereo check alongside the stereo and look for 2 thin slits to find the spot you have to insert the tool 6 x research source if the slots sit further back you might need a flashlight to see them some pickup trucks and suvs have 2 holes on each side instead of a thin slot in this case you ll need a 2 pronged tool or wire to access the stereo clips 7 x research source always confirm the process to remove the radio in your car owner s manual insert radio keys into the slots on either side of the stereo radio keys are small flat tools that undo the clips holding the stereo in they may come with your car or you can get a set from an auto parts store slide a key into each slot on either side of the stereo 8 x research source you need both keys in at the same time to release the stereo if you don t have radio keys you can use any flat piece of metal that fits into the radio slots some choices include thin knives files or hangers radio keys are sometimes called din tools if you re looking in an auto parts store press the keys until they click continue inserting the radio keys into the slots until you hear a click this means that you ve released the clips holding the radio in 9 x research source if you don t hear a click but the keys stop moving then they re probably inserted enough you should be able to pull the stereo out keep the keys inserted while you take the radio out if you remove them the clips will clamp back down remove the screws and bolts around the stereo if it doesn t use clips newer cars bolt the stereo in instead of using clips if you don t see any spaces to insert the keys around the radio then check in the corners for screws or bolts if you find these use a philips head screwdriver or socket wrench to remove them to free the stereo 10 x research source keep track of the screws and bolts you remove so you can put the radio back in slide the stereo body out of the socket grab the stereo by its outer edge and pull it straight back continue sliding it until it comes out of the radio socket be careful not to drop it once it s free 11 x research source you might have to jiggle the radio a bit to work it out of position don t keep pulling once the radio comes out because it s still plugged in unplug the stereo to complete the removal there are usually at least 2 plugs in the back of the stereo the antenna connects to the right side this plug pops out normally so just pull it out on the left side the electrical wires attach with a clamp squeeze the clamp to release it then pull those wires out the stereo is now completely free 12 x research source there might be other wires attached to the back of the stereo as well pull these out as needed to get the stereo out,Computers-and-Electronics
how to stop amp hum,it can be really annoying when you plug into an amplifier and it starts humming unwanted feedback from your amp can be caused by bad wiring radio interference or loose connections between your equipment luckily there are a few things you can try to help reduce or completely eliminate the constant hum once you fix the source of the hum your amp will have clear and crisp audio,lower the gain setting on your amp for the easiest solution the gain setting increases the strength of the amp s signal which effectively makes the audio louder find the dial labeled gain on your amp s control panel and turn it counterclockwise keep turning the dial until you don t hear the humming sound coming from your amp anymore 1 x research source if you still hear the amp humming then there may be an issue with the wiring or the equipment the amp plugs into turn off fluorescent lights and other interference sources in the room fluorescent lights bluetooth devices computer monitors and dimmer switches all emit frequencies that create radio interference for amps leave your amp turned on while you shut off other devices in the room one by one listen carefully to the amp as you turn off each device to see if the hum disappears if you can still hear the hum turn the equipment back on since it wasn t affecting your amp 2 x research source you may not be able to completely get rid of the interference but it won t be as noticeable plug equipment into the same outlet to prevent ground loop feedback if you have an amp plugged into one outlet and another piece of equipment in a different outlet you may hear feedback once you connect them unplug your amp and any other equipment you plan on using with it then choose 1 outlet and plug everything back in if you don t have enough sockets for all your equipment use a power strip that has a built in surge protector so you don t blow a circuit 3 x research source wall sockets have slightly different voltages when you plug into them so connecting 2 pieces of equipment between them creates a difference in frequency that makes the amp hum called ground loop feedback never remove grounding prongs or use 2 prong adaptors for your amp otherwise you aren t protected from electrical shock move your equipment around to find an area with the least interference plug in your amp and connect it to the equipment you plan on using carry your piece of equipment to different spots in the room and listen to the feedback coming out of the amp if you re closer to a source of interference the hum will get louder and more prominent once you find a place where you can t hear the hum place your equipment there 4 x research source connect to a hum reducing adaptor if you can t plug into the same outlet hum reducing adaptors help balance out frequencies if you have to plug your equipment into 2 separate outlets turn off your amp and unplug it from the wall plug the hum reducing adaptor into the wall outlet connect the amp into the socket on the adaptor before turning it back on 5 x research source hum reducing adaptors usually cost around 80 usd and you can buy them online or from music stores use the shortest cables possible to reduce noise long cables are more likely to pick up radio frequencies and feedback when you connect them to an amp always look for stereo and connector cables that have a little slack when you plug your amp into a piece of equipment 6 x research source avoid using cables that are pulled tight since you could damage their internal wiring clip a ferrite choke to your cable to get rid of high frequency hums a ferrite choke is a cylindrical clip that attaches around a wire and cuts out high frequency noises position the ferrite choke about 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm from either end of the cable you re using to connect your amp to your equipment place the cable in the center channel of the choke and clip it closed to stop the feedback 7 x research source you can buy a ferrite choke online or from your local electronics stores some cables will come with ferrite chokes already built into the wiring try wiggling the connector cables to see if there s a loose connection loose cables cause a lot of feedback since they slightly detach from the circuitry connect your instrument or piece of equipment to the output port on your amp and turn them both on wiggle the end of the cable attached to your equipment back and forth in the port to see if it causes any interference if it does then the equipment has a loose jack you may be able to fix it by taking the equipment apart and tightening the interior connection with a screwdriver 8 x research source if you can t take the equipment apart then you may need to replace it you can also try cleaning out the port on your equipment use different cables in case the old ones are damaged unplug the connector cable you re using for your equipment and set it aside use a replacement cable that s the exact same as the first one and try connecting it to your amp turn the amp on and listen for any audio feedback if you don t hear anything then get rid of the old cable since it was causing the problem 9 x research source always keep multiple cables with your amp so you have spares if you need them solder wire connections inside your amplifier if they re undone turn off and unplug your amplifier before you start working look inside the back of your amplifier and wiggle each of the wire connections to see if the ends are loose if they are use a soldering iron to secure the connections so they stay in place once the solder hardens trying turning your amp back on to see if it s still humming 10 x research source if your amp still hums there may be an issue with other equipment you re connecting to it always turn off and unplug your amp while you re working on the internal electronics so you don t shock yourself check for loose wiring on your equipment if you still here humming turn off and unplug your equipment so you don t risk getting shocked remove the panel or cover near the equipment s input port so you can access the wiring inside wiggle the wires carefully to see if any of the ends are loose or disconnected if they are solder or rewire the equipment so they have a firm connection put your equipment back together and try testing it with your amp to see if it works 11 x research source if you re not comfortable taking apart your equipment check if there s a manufacturer s warranty so you can have it professionally fixed otherwise you may need to replace it,Computers-and-Electronics

how to take the flash off a polaroid camera,using a polaroid camera and printing off photos in the moment has a special kind of joy and magic associated with it but of course with just one shot to get the photo right there s also a bit of pressure most polaroid pictures need the flash to come out clear and detailed but if you re out in bright sunlight it could make your subject look washed out in that case you may need to override or even cover the flash,turn the camera on with the power switch button or by flipping up the flashbar to engage or disengage the flash function your camera has to be on first most models have a power button located on the front or top of the camera the polaroid snap and some other models turn on when you flip up the flashbar which contains the lens 1 x research source if you re unsure of how to turn on your particular polaroid search online for a user s manual for a diagram of the buttons and functions locate and push down on the flash override button each model is slightly different but you should be able to find this button pretty easily look for the button that shows a lightning bolt with a strike going through it it s usually located next to the flash button or light it may be on the front or the back of your camera 2 x research source polaroids often need a lot of light to turn out well so the cameras are set to automatically use the flash function no matter what the flash button is sometimes just an led light that lights up when the camera is turned on to let you know the flash is ready to go push the shutter button while still holding the flash override button to disengage the flash hold the override button as you take the picture this can be a little tricky if you ve never done it before and sometimes your fingers can get in the way of the lens so take a moment to double check that your hands are out of the way before your snap your photo 3 x research source once you take the photo you can release the override button access the menu on a polaroid snap to turn the flash on or off the polaroid snap is a lot smaller than other models and doesn t have the same buttons or functions on the exterior of the camera turn the camera on and access the menu scroll to the settings option select the flash and tap through the options until a line appears through the lightning bolt 4 x research source remember to turn the flash back on once you re done taking the photo change the lighting by using the lighten darken switch rather than the flash the flash is usually pretty essential to taking great photos with clarity but sometimes you want to make images appear darker or lighter some models of polaroid have a lighten darken switch that can create a brighter or darker photo 5 x research source in dim lighting switch it to the lighten position if it s super bright out switch it to the darken position polaroids polaroid originals and the i 1 cameras have these switches cover the flash with clear tape or tissue paper to reduce its intensity if you need the flash because you re taking a photo indoors but don t like how washed out you end up looking you can diffuse the intensity of the flash by covering it with something light and semi translucent 6 x research source play around with using 1 2 or 3 pieces of tissue paper or tape for different results stand about 2 feet 610 mm away from the subject to take a clear photo if you re too close or too far away the camera lens will focus on either the background or the foreground especially if one of them is a lot darker than the other get in a close range to reduce blurriness 7 x research source this means that selfies are usually out of the question if you re using a polaroid you could use the self timer and set up the camera and position yourself a few feet away from it though to get a self portrait being too close to someone or something can produce a blurry photo sometimes that effect can look cool though if you re new to polaroids try playing around with different techniques to discover what works for you keep the sunlight or main light behind you or off to the side shooting straight into the light will result in a photo with a lot of contrast and you might not be able to see any details of the thing or person you re shooting the best rule of thumb is to stand so you re facing away from the light 8 x research source this is called backlighting crop your photos before you take them to get rid of unwanted visuals with a polaroid you don t have the option to digitally crop and alter images after the fact if you re taking a picture and don t want strangers in the background wait until they re out of the way or reposition your subject so they re not in frame 9 x research source when taking a photo step back for a moment and look at the entire screen to make sure it looks how you want the polaroid snap has the option to take digital photos that you can upload to your computer and then edit but most models print a photo automatically meaning you can t crop the edges hold the camera as still as possible until the photo is finished printing pretend that you re a statue moving around before the picture has fully printed could result in a blurry photograph 10 x research source try holding the camera in the palm of your left hand for extra stability protect your photo from light for 5 15 minutes so it develops fully black and white photos need about 5 10 minutes while color photos should have about 10 15 minutes keep your photo face down or in a pocket 11 x research source you might be tempted to shake the film to help the photo develop but that s a myth leave it alone and move it as little as possible to help your picture come out perfectly 12 x research source keep your camera and photos close to your body in cold weather temperatures lower than 55 f 13 c can make your camera and film produce photos that aren t as colorful or detailed as they could be to prevent this keep your camera warm by carrying it close to your body inside your coat would be great and keep printed photos close to your body too 13 x research source it can be hard to keep pictures close to your body without bending them but do your best gently slide them into a coat pocket if you plan ahead wear a shirt with a big front pocket so you can keep them in there,Computers-and-Electronics

the stock media player that is supplied with windows this guide s steps refer to wmp 12 other versions of the software will also work but button locations may vary press the burn button on the right this opens a panel on the right to create a burn list drag and drop audio files into the burn list the files will need to be a filetype supported by wmp mp3 mp4 wav aac are among the most common when burned to a cd the software will transcode the files to a lossless format audio cds are limited to an 80 minute playtime this is an industry standard set by manufacturers this means that the number of songs you can fit onto the cd will vary depending on the length of the track cd packaging may also mention a 700mb capacity but this measurement is used for making data cds a data cd works like a storage device and can only be read by computers click the menu in the burn panel this opens a menu with different burn options select audio cd from the menu press the start burn button the cd burn process will begin after completion the disc will eject automatically and be ready for playback if you cancel the burn process or it fails you will need to use a new cd to try again open itunes this can be accessed in applications itunes or from the application dock on windows you can launch from start all apps all programs on windows 7 and earlier itunes this is the stock media player that is supplied with osx but is very common across platforms due to the popularity of apple mobile devices this guide s steps refer to itunes 12 other versions of the software will also work but button

another media player or maybe you don t use your computer for music listening and have no need for a media player at all when downloading any software it is always best to get it from the original developer website this helps to ensure that the installer has not been tampered with or loaded with extra software or malware if a developer does not host the file for download on their own site there is usually a list of trusted mirrors to use instead try a different media player vlc media player and foobar2000 are two free media players that are popular for their speed customizability and broad codec filetype support since these programs are still media players the process of burning an audio cd will be very similar to using wmp or itunes foobar2000 is for windows only try a dedicated burning program infrarecorder and imgburn are two free no nonsense burning programs for those who do not need playback support these programs boast a more comprehensive array of burning options like mixed mode which allows user to create hybrid audio data cds because these programs support more complex burning features this options is recommended for more advanced users or those who really don t want the extra weight of a media player both infrarecorder and imgburn are windows only burn is a strong simple option for mac users,Computers-and-Electronics

how to tell if beats are fake,beats are a trendy brand of headphones that fetch a high end price tag at the store as a result of their popularity brand name recognition and price they re often counterfeited in an attempt to rip off unsuspecting buyers to spot a fake pair of beats headphones start with the external packaging look at the printing of the letters the trademark logos and the quality of the plastic wrap once a box is opened inspect the inside of the right ear to see if there s a serial number go online to see if the serial number is valid or already in use to avoid getting scammed only buy expensive electronics from licensed retailers and remember if a deal sounds too good to be true it probably is,look at the typeface on the box to see if it s blurry or clean often you can determine whether beats are fake or not simply by looking carefully at the words on the box real beats have a strong contrast between the letters on the outside of the package and the minimalistic background if the letters are blurry faded or look like they were printed on paper and glued to the box you may have a box of fake beats 1 x research source every model and version of beats has slightly different packaging this can make it hard to identify certain fakes check the big studio or solo for a trademark logo on the bottom right the studio and solo model of beats headphones are the 2 higher end models that are often faked both of these headphones have the model name printed in large letters on the side and back of the box if the studio or solo printed on the back doesn t have a trademark logo on the bottom right side it may be a fake pair 2 x research source the trademark logo is simply the letters tm printed in a smaller font some versions of the headphones don t have the trademark logo on the front or back but on the manual that comes with the headphones the ep lineup of headphones is not trademarked so it won t have a trademark logo they are the cheaper lineup of headphones though so they re rarely counterfeited compare the photo of the headphones on the box to an authentic package if the packaging is fake the box may have been digitally edited to look authentic the counterfeiter likely had to replace the picture of the headphones on the box see if the headphone on the box matches the headphones on the beats official website specifically compare the highlights created by the light on the official packaging to the highlights on the box you re inspecting if the photo is off the packaging is edited and you almost certainly have a fake pair 3 x research source on the studio and solo boxes the highlights created by the lights are on the top of the ear on both the left and the right investigate the plastic seal to see if it s airtight around the packaging the box that the beats come in should be firmly sealed in a plastic cover if the plastic isn t airtight the beats may have been tampered with if you re considering buying a brand new pair don t go through with the purchase if the plastic is missing partially removed or damaged 4 x research source it is really hard to reseal fake headphones in the plastic casing that real beats come in this is because most counterfeiters don t have access to the binding machines needed to seal something in plastic look at the seam on the carrying case to see if it s shiny or thin take the carrying case out and unzip it unfold the carrying case and inspect the zipper less section where the 2 halves of the case fold over if the padding on the inside of the crease is identical to the rest of the case s padding the beats are probably real if the fabric is shinier or thinner than the rest of the case the headphones may be fake 5 x research source this is an exceptionally common element amongst counterfeit headphones many fake headphone manufacturers put all of the effort into making the headphones look right that they forget about things like the carrying case counterfeiters will often take 2 broken halves of the carrying case and glue or knit them together to refit a carrying case this makes the crease for a fake pair look different than a real one on a real pair the padding on the crease will be identical to the rest of the case find which ear the serial number is printed on for a simple test with the headphones in both hands look at the case around each ear cushion you will find an l and r which indicate which ear is the left side and which ear is the right side pull your headphones out to extend the headband and make it taller look on the inside of the exposed plastic that comes up to raise the headband to find your serial number if the number is on the left ear the headphones are absolutely fake 6 x research source beats never prints the serial number on the left ear however just because the number is on the right doesn t mean that the headphones are automatically real if your serial number is on the right try registering it to see if the number is valid register your beats online to see if the serial number is valid go to https www beatsbydre com register and wait for the registration screen to pop up enter the serial number listed on the right side of your headphones press verify my serial number if a screen pops up that says we re sorry your serial number is invalid this is a possible sign that you ve got a pair of counterfeit headphones on hand 7 x research source if you bought used headphones it may simply have already been verified the seller should still be able to show you the verification paperwork or their online profile to prove it though plug in your beats to the computer while visiting the upgrade page to run a test go online to the beats update page where owners of beats headphones can update drivers and patch security issues the site installs updates through your computer by plugging a usb cable into any port and connecting it to your headphones if your headphones are fake you ll get an error message when you plug them in to update them visit http your beatsbydre com locale en us to open the update page 8 x research source you aren t really putting your computer at risk by plugging in fake headphones the odds that they re going to be infected with malware or viruses are really low buy from authorized retailers to avoid counterfeits if you buy headphones from a personal seller on craigslist who doesn t have the receipt or warranty information you re highly likely to purchase fake headphones if you buy from a reputable seller at a brick and mortar store you re less likely to get ripped off by a pair of fake headphones 9 x research source amazon best buy micro center nike and target are all examples of authorized retailers you can find the complete list of legitimate retailers online at https www beatsbydre com company authorized retailers avoid prices that seem too good to be true there s no real reason that someone would price 250 headphones at 50 unless they re damaged or fake if it sounds like an unbelievable deal don t believe it unless there s a giant promotion going on at an authorized retailer or you re buying them during a black friday event the odds are high that something will be seriously wrong with the headphones 10 x research source dismiss classified ads or auctions where the paperwork is missing while it s not impossible to get a good deal on some headphones by buying a used pair from another individual be wary of any offers that don t include the warranty paperwork if they don t have the warranty paperwork and you really want to know they re real try registering the serial number before handing the money over it s impossible to fake a legitimate serial number 11 x research source if they ve already registered the headphones they should have the registration paperwork or a link to a personalized profile with the headphones listed,Computers-and-Electronics

how to hook up an equalizer,an equalizer is a useful piece of audio equipment that allows the user to adjust the frequency responses of an audio signal they are available in a range of different prices and features but all perform the same basic function adjustment of the sound level at different frequencies learning how to hook up an equalizer to your stereo system or vehicle is a straightforward process requiring a few simple considerations,connect the equalizer to your receiver for the easiest connection most receivers have either preamp in and preamp out connections or tape monitor connections in most cases these are the best way to connect an equalizer to your stereo connecting to the tape monitor channels will require connection to only your receiver learn how to hook up an equalizer to the receiver instead purchase 2 pairs of rca cables to run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and then to your amplifier you will need 2 sets of rca cable the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and cd players the length of the rca cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer connect one pair of rca cables between the receiver and equalizer connect one pair of cables to the pre amp output channels on the receiver and the other end of the cable to the left and right channel inputs on the equalizer you will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer right channel jacks will usually take the red colored rca plug while left channel should take white or black rca plugs connect the other pair of rca cables between the receiver and amplifier connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the left and right input channels on the amplifier right channel jacks will usually take the red colored rca plug while left channel should take white or black rca plugs connect the amp to the receiver the amplifier should remain connected to the receiver with an rca cable between the amplifier outputs and the amp inputs on the receiver this effectively creates a loop from the receiver through the equalizer and amplifier and back to the receiver turn on the receiver equalizer and amplifier to use your equalizer turn on all three components and adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences you should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music hook up your equalizer to your receiver if it does not have preamp out channels the equalizer should always be between the receiver and the amplifier your amplifier will need integrated preamp out and preamp in connections to work with this method purchase 2 pairs of rca cables to run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again you ll need 2 sets of rca cable the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and cd players the length of the rca cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer connect one pair of rca cables between the receiver and equalizer connect one pair of cables to the tape monitor output channels on the receiver and the other end of the cable to the left and right channel inputs on the equalizer you will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer connect the other pair of rca cables between the receiver and equalizer connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the tape monitor input channels on the back of the receiver right channel jacks will usually take the red colored rca plug while left channel should take white or black rca plugs use your equalizer turn on the receiver and switch the front panel output control to the tape monitor setting this opens the tape monitor channels and means that the sound will travel through your equalizer before being sent to the amplifier adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences you should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music to switch on the tape monitor setting you should depress the button on the front panel of the equalizer if you have a tape deck connected to the tape monitor channels then you will have to remove this before connecting your equalizer connect the equalizer directly to your amplifier if your receiver does not have preamp output channels or tape monitor channels but your amplifier has preamp in and out channels most receivers have either preamp in and preamp out connections or tape monitor connections in most cases these are the best way to connect an equalizer to your stereo however if your receiver does not have these channels then some amplifiers allow you to connect the equalizer directly connecting to the amplifier directly will require preamp in and preamp out channels on your amplifier purchase 2 pairs of rca cables to run a signal from your equalizer to the amplifier and back again you ll need 2 sets of rca cable the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and cd players the length of the rca cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer connect one pair of rca cables between the equalizer and amplifier connect one pair of cables to the pre amp output channels on the amplifier and the other end of the cable to the pre amp input channels on the equalizer you will usually find these channels on the rear of the equalizer right channel jacks will usually take the red colored rca plug while left channel should take white or black rca plugs sometimes the amplifier channels will say tape monitor output rather than pre amp output so you can also use these connect the other pair of rca cables between the amplifier and receiver connect the other pair of cables from the output channels on the back of the equalizer to the pre amp input channels on the amplifier right channel jacks will usually take the red colored rca plug while left channel should take white or black rca plugs some amplifiers might have tape monitor input rather than pre amp input channels so you can also use these switch on the pre amp connection on the amplifier some amplifiers will have a switch to turn on the pre amp connections if you are using tape monitor channels then you will also need to switch on the tape monitor switch depress the button to turn on this connection turn on the receiver equalizer and amplifier to use your equalizer turn on all three components and adjust the equalizer knobs according to your preferences you should now be able to manipulate the controls on the equalizer to change the frequency response or tone of your music use this method to connect an equalizer to your car stereo in a remote location for additional space some equalizers are designed for installation in your dash while others are designed for a remote location such as the trunk the installation location will depend on your particular choice of equalizer and preferences many prefer to install their equalizers in their trunk near the amp so that they have the option to easily add additional amps later some vehicles will not have space in the dash for an equalizer and will need to remote mount their equalizer equalizers can be installed anywhere between your amp and receiver most remote mount equalizers will come with a remote so that you can change the controls from the driver s seat decide where you would like to mount the equalizer most people prefer to mount their remote mount equalizer in their trunk near the amp this way they can easily add additional amps later on by connecting a close wire other possible locations include under a seat in the vehicle remember that wherever you mount your equalizer you will have to run wires to your head unit or receiver and amplifier purchase 2 pairs of rca cables to run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again you ll need 2 sets of rca cable the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and cd players the length of the rca cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer remove your receiver from the dash remove your receiver from the dash so that you can access the wires behind usually you can pull off the plastic piece covering the dash and then pull the receiver slightly out connect the rca cables to your in dash receiver plug the two rca cables into the receiver s preamp outputs tape them together so they will not come apart bring the cables to the equalizer and plug in route the cables through the dash to the equalizer you should use tape or wire ties along the way to connect the two cables together plug the cables into the preamp inputs on your equalizer 1 x research source mount your equalizer to the vehicle do not mount your equalizer directly to the metal chassis this will interfere with the sound it is better to mount the equalizer on a platform or some kind of rubber material to prevent interference if you must bolt the equalizer directly to the metal chassis then you should use rubber pieces between the equalizer and the vehicle turn off your ignition turn off your ignition completely and remove your keys before you begin installation this is for your safety while you connect the wires to avoid getting shocked connect your ground wire on your equalizer you will see three wires the black one is the ground wire remove a bolt near the equalizer mounting location and scrape away any paint covering the location around the bolt crimp a ring on the end of the wire and bolt this to the vehicle if there is no location available then you will have to drill a hole in the chassis be very careful not to damage the gas tank or brake line while doing this connect the power cable the yellow wire could be red or another color check your manual on your equalizer is the 12v power cable connect this cable either to the power cable attached to the receiver or to a 12v variable power source in the fuse box such as the wiper fuse if your receiver does not have a wiring diagram to show which wires are switched power cables then you should use a digital multimeter to identify the correct cable connect the multimeter to the cable when the key is in the off position and make sure the voltage reads at zero then turn the key into the on position and see if there is now 12v if the wire follows this pattern then you have found the correct switched 12v power wire splice the wires together and wrap the exposed metal with electrical tape completely this prevents the exposed areas from touching other wires and potentially shorting the system you can also crimp the wires together but this is not as strong as splicing this wire will need to be routed from the receiver to wherever the equalizer is mounted connect the remote turn on wire this wire will usually be a blue wire with a white stripe and should be labeled on your equalizer on the receiver should be a blue usually blue but can be other colors wire that goes to the amplifier connect this wire to the blue wire on the receiver after routing it through the vehicle from where the equalizer is located splice or crimp the wires together to make a connection and then wrap the connection in electrical tape test the equalizer by turning on the car put the key in the ignition and turn it to the on position then turn on the radio to check that everything is working well and that the equalizer turns on with the radio replace the receiver put the receiver back into its bracket and place the frame covering back into place be sure all the wiring is pushed inside the dash beforehand use this method to connect an equalizer to your car stereo in the dash if you want easy access to the controls some equalizers are designed to for installation in your dash while others are designed for a remote location such as the trunk the installation location will depend on your particular choice of equalizer and preferences many prefer to install their equalizers in the dash of the vehicle so that they can have access to the controls continuously equalizers can be installed anywhere between your amp and receiver decide where you would like to install the equalizer the best place to install an in dash equalizer is right above or below your head unit or stereo control unit some vehicles will have space for this in their dash other vehicles will not have space and the equalizer can then be mounted under the dash the final option is to custom fit your equalizer into the dash if you have space in your dash then you will simply need an installation kit to mount your equalizer these kits are brackets that hold the head unit to the dash and require only a few screws to attach your kit will come with particular instructions for mounting if you do not have space in your dash you will need an under dash mounting kit these kits are usually designed for under the dash on the driver s side although other options are available there are many different designs for under dash kits so choose on that you prefer and works well with your vehicle if you would like to have a custom install then it is best to leave the job to a professional audio installer purchase 2 pairs of rca cables to run a signal from your stereo receiver to the equalizer and back again you ll need 2 sets of rca cable the same kind that is usually used to connect source components like turntables and cd players the length of the rca cables should match the length of the distance between the receiver and the equalizer to avoid cable clutter it s best to buy patch size cables which are only about a foot 30 cm in length remove your receiver from the dash remove your receiver from the dash so that you can access the wires behind usually you can pull off the plastic piece covering the dash and then pull the receiver slightly out connect the rca cables to your in dash receiver plug the two rca cables into the receiver s preamp outputs tape them together so they will not come apart bring the cables to the equalizer and plug in route the cables through the dash to the equalizer you should use tape or wire ties along the way to connect the two cables together plug the cables into the preamp inputs on your equalizer mount your equalizer mount your equalizer to whichever location you have chosen you will simply need to attach a few screws in order to mount your equalizer turn off your ignition turn off your ignition completely and remove your keys before you begin installation this is for your safety while you connect the wires to avoid getting shocked connect your ground wire on your equalizer you will see three wires the black one is the ground wire on the back of the receiver will also be a black ground wire and you should splice or crimp these wires together after making the connection wrap it in electrical tape if you cannot find a black wire on the receiver remove a bolt near the equalizer mounting location and scrape away any paint covering the location around the bolt crimp a ring on the end of the wire and bolt this to the vehicle if there is no location available then you will have to drill a hole in the chassis be very careful not to damage the gas tank or brake line while doing this connect the power cable the yellow wire could be red or another

how to troubleshoot an amp,if you like your music crisp and loud you need a good amp in your setup unfortunately amps break down time to time although they are relatively simple to diagnose inspect your amp to pinpoint some of the likely causes of the problem you re experiencing wiring problems from blown fuses to damaged wires are the most common issues if you re using a tube amp with a guitar replace any bad tubes you find with some sharp troubleshooting you can often fix an amp without ever taking it in for service,look for lights indicating that the amp is turned on activate the amp like you normally would and note what happens no matter what type of amp you have something is supposed to change when you hit the on switch and turn up the volume a lot of amps have power lights that activate when the amp is live also listen for any noises the amp makes since that could also help you determine the source of the problem 1 x research source car amps for example often have a green power led light and a red protect light the protect light often means a blown fuse so you know to check the wiring when you see it check the wiring to make sure the amp is plugged in go over all the wires double checking that they are plugged in correctly if the amp doesn t activate at all when you turn it on the problem could have to do with the power supply sometimes you have to contend with a loose cord which is a very easy fix to make wiggle the wires testing them to see if they are in place and cause the amp to activate at all 2 x research source car amps for instance often have a red power wire and a black ground wire it also has a blue remote turn on wire that powers the amp when you turn on your vehicle if your amp plugs into the wall test the power cord also make sure your guitar speakers subwoofers and other devices are connected to the amp if you re using them test the sound quality on the amp to pick up unusual noises so your amp turns on which is a plus but it doesn t sound right sound distortion can be caused by a few different issues depending on what kind of amp you have it is often from loose wires but it could also be your overall setup sometimes replacing the wires fixing the amp s components or changing your setup suddenly makes everything better 3 x research source if you don t hear any sound but know your amp is on the wiring is likely the culprit moving the wires may give you a burst of sound you may also need to detach speakers or other devices overpowering the amp turn off the power supply before handling the fuse make sure you deactivate the amp first if you re troubleshooting a car amp turn off the car s engine and remove the ignition key otherwise unplug the amp from the wall 4 x research source always turn off the electricity before handling fuses or exposed wires pick up the fuse to see if the wire is broken in it locate the fuse by looking on the back of the amp or by following the black ground wire most amps have a fuse installed on them car amps may also have a separate fuse in a small box close to the battery lift the fuse out with a pair of needle nose pliers to check the small metal wire inside of it 5 x research source the location of the fuse depends on your amp search its casing thoroughly and follow any electrical wires test the fuse with a multimeter a multimeter is a device that detects electrical currents in fuses and wires it has a black lead and a red lead you touch to the ends of the fuse after turning on the machine set its dial to 200 ω the lowest resistance setting then touch the leads to the exposed ends of the fuse to see if the readout shows a number like 0 6 ohms showing that the fuse isn t the problem 6 x research source before touching the fuse touch the leads together the multimeter will read 100 if everything is working if that doesn t change when you touch the fuse then the fuse is broken if you re using a fuse with metal prongs touch a lead to each prong for a glass tube fuse touch the lead to the ends of the tube replace the fuse with an identical one if it looks damaged broken or scorched fuses often mean a simple fix you will need to get a fuse that has the same amperage rating as the one you re replacing a lot of amps use fuses rated 25 or 30 and this number is usually printed on the fuse itself you could also double check your owner s manual for the correct rating before popping a new fuse into your device 7 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source most fuses can be found at auto part stores and hardware stores bring your broken fuse in and ask for the staff to find a replacement if you can t get a fuse there look for online electronics shops the type of fuse you need depends on the amp you have car amps use plug fuses that are similar to or often the same as normal car fuses home stereo and guitar amps may use glass tube fuses getting the exact fuse is very important if you get a fuse with a lower rating it won t provide enough amperage to power your amp a fuse with a higher amperage could carry too much power and cause a fire turn on the amp to see if the fuse blows again plug the amp back in and reactivate the electrical circuit then turn on the amp if it works then congratulations you solved the problem sometimes the fuse could blow again right away meaning that you probably have a short in the wiring 8 x research source you will hear the fuse blow out listen for a pop as soon as you turn on the amp the amp will lose power right after that if the fuse blows before you turn on the amp the problem may be in the electrical circuit this could mean your car or home wiring is broken or getting too much power if the fuse blows as soon as you turn the amp on the amp probably has an internal problem that needs to be fixed unplug the connecting wires to see if the protect light turns off the protect light on an amp is there to keep the amp safe when something goes wrong test it by disconnecting the amp if you re working on a car amp simply remove the red wire on its back end watch the light in case it turns off meaning that the problem is likely somewhere in the wiring 9 x research source to access the wires connecting to a car amp you may need to pull the faceplate off of your radio pry the edges of the plate with a plastic tool until you are able to pull it off the car if the light stays on the amp itself could be the problem it may have shorted out from a strong electrical current so take it to an experienced repair technician inspect all of the wires for any signs of damage take a quick glance across all of the connecting wires notice any broken wires burnt out wires or anything else that looks out of place these signs of damage could be the reason the amp is getting too much power any wires that look loose or improperly placed could also be responsible for the problem 10 x research source broken wires can easily prevent an amp from turning on they are also dangerous since the exposed metal conducts an electrical current don t touch it unless you re sure the power is off use a multimeter to test for blown wires wires could become grounded when they come loose and touch something they aren t supposed to touch the black and red test leads of the multimeter to the end of the power wire if the wires still work the multimeter will react 11 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source your amp needs to be turned on for this when it is on the wires conduct about 12 to 14 volts of electricity if you re working on a car amp try touching the red lead to the amp end of the red power cord touch the black lead to the negative terminal on your car battery lift up any wire connections touching bare metal metal causes active wires to short circuit so reposition them to fix them it happens sometimes with car amps and speakers that have loose wires turn off the power first before handling the wires then find safe out of the way spots to secure them with plastic wire ties test the wires with a multimeter if you need to in order to be certain that they aren t active 12 x research source the dangerous part is the exposed ends of the wire the insulated parts can touch metal without causing a problem and they won t harm you either blowouts caused by metal ruin the fuse if your amp has one if it doesn t the amp or speaker could overload and take damage hook up working electrical cables to test the amp pull the rca plug cables out from the back of the amp then replace them with new ones rca cables are colored cables that easily plug into the back of the amp but make sure the ones you get are compatible with the amp you have afterward turn on the amp to see if that solves the issue 13 x research source if the new cables work chances are your old ones were faulty and you won t have any more problems test the sound by unplugging the sound cables or colored rca wires what you hear is often as important as what you see when dealing with an unruly amp now that you know your amp isn t completely busted remove the sound wires connecting to speakers and other devices if the noise stops then you know you have a wiring problem 14 x research source hissing and crackling are often easy to fix by rearranging the wires or getting complimentary speakers if the noise doesn t stop then you probably have a faulty amp to replace compare the amp s power ratings with the speakers and subwoofers every device has an amperage rating that indicates what current strength it can handle use speakers with a similar or slightly higher rating than the amp the wrong rating whether it is too low or too high means your system won t work the way you want it to 15 x research source if the amp has a much lower rating than the other devices it won t send enough sound to the speakers you may hear a lot of static or get a low volume sound higher amp ratings lead to a louder stronger sound quality however if the amps are more powerful than the speakers your speakers could burn out much quicker than usual reroute speakers wires so they aren t touching one another hissing coming from your speakers is often a sign that the wires aren t positioned correctly it s an easy fix but it s often a little annoying and time consuming go back through the wires separating the speaker wires from the amp wires tuck the speaker wires into safe areas taping them down or using plastic ties to keep them in place 16 x research source the positive and negative wires are a common problem when they touch they cause the system to go silent and lose power this doesn t usually harm your devices you can test for wire problems by moving the wires apart while the speakers and amplifier are on don t touch any exposed ends or active power sources like a car battery or wall outlet listen for the sound to come back on as you separate the wires stabilize the speaker enclosure to prevent rattling loose speakers and subwoofers rattle in their cases as sound passes through them make sure your devices fit securely in storage spots or leave them out in the open so they aren t bumping against things keep them well mounted so they don t move at all if your devices have screws holding them in place tighten the screws to prevent them from rattling 17 x research source whooshing sounds happen when air gets pushed out of a speaker or subwoofer as it vibrates you can fix it by mounting the device to stabilize it or by turning down its settings to make it rattle less connect the amp to a working pair of speakers if your amp turns on but no sound comes out of the speakers your overall setup may be the problem not all speakers are compatible with an amp if your amp is still alive it will respond when you connect it to speakers and other devices in good condition turn up the volume to see if anything changes 18 x research source fixing any wiring and mounting issues solves sound problems if your amp still works radio silence from a good pair of speakers is a good sign that your amp needs to be replaced inspect the glass tubes for cracks and other signs of damage damaged tubes are usually very easy to spot plug your amp in turn it on and watch the tubes light up any tube that stays unlit or has cracks in it needs to be replaced milky stains inside the glass are also signs of a dead tube 19 x research source if the amp doesn t turn on at all it might simply be broken test it in another wall outlet first a bad power supply could be fixed by a technician in some cases tap the tubes with a pencil and listen for distortion tap the top of each tube very lightly to force it to vibrate listen for the sound the vibration makes unusual sounds which could be anything from simple static to the worst squeals you have ever heard are a bad sign find the tube that sounds different from the others and replace it 20 x research source another way to do it is to press down lightly on each tube as you play your guitar the tubes get very hot so cover up play individual notes to cause each tube to rattle as you listen for anything out of the ordinary spray a contact cleaner on the tube plug to test it let the offending tube cool down before you pull it out of the amp coat the plug with a contact cleaner then put it back into the amp sometimes doing this cleans out the connection causing the tube to work again test it out with your guitar 21 x research source a contact cleaner is basically compressed air mixed with isopropyl alcohol you can get spray bottles full of it at most hardware stores you may need to pull the tube out of the socket and put it back in a few times before the cleaner affects it replace all of the wires to make sure they work right sound problems with a tube amp are typically because of the tubes but sometimes the cables cause distortion if you hear sound coming from the amp make sure your guitar plug in isn t loose or else it could cause rattling also check the rca wires running the speakers to make sure they are intact and plugged in 22 x

how to use a mixer,an audio mixer also known as a mixing board or a soundboard is used to control the levels of multiple inputs so you can balance the sounds correctly mixing is an important process when you record music or perform live so one instrument doesn t overpower the others using a mixer may seem intimidating at first but it s not too hard once you know what the knobs do after you connect your instruments or microphones adjust the volume of each input until you find the mix you like,turn the master volume and channel faders down completely look for the main volume control on the bottom right side of the mixer which is usually labeled main mix or something similar the faders are knobs or sliders that control the volumes of individual inputs found along the bottom of the mixer and are either knobs or sliders if the controls are knobs turn them counterclockwise until they don t go any further if the controls are sliders pull them down as far as you can to lower the volume 1 x research source if you turn on the mixer without turning the volume and faders down you could create loud feedback or damage the mixer the main volume control and faders usually have a different color than the other controls so you can easily tell them apart plug microphones into channels using xlr cables xlr cables are used to plug microphones in and the ends have 3 pins inside a metal cylinder your mixer will either have xlr ports along the top edge or on the back side of the mixer plug the end of the xlr cable into the microphone you re using put the other end of the xlr cable in one of the ports on the mixer that has 3 small holes inside a circle the number above the port determines the input channel which is a column on your mixer with knobs that controls that single input 2 x research source you can buy xlr cables from a music supply store or online the number of inputs you can have on your mixer depends on how many channels it has an 8 channel mixer can have up to 8 different inputs while a 32 channel mixer can have 32 sources attach instruments to the line inputs on your mixer the line inputs on your mixer are found near the xlr ports for each channel and fit 6 35 mm audio jacks plug the end of your audio cable into the instrument you re hooking up then choose a channel on your mixer that doesn t have another cable attached to it and attach the other end of the audio cable to the line input the number above the input tells you which channel controls the audio for the instrument 3 x research source you cannot plug an instrument into a line input on a channel that already has an xlr cable plugged into it you can also buy audio cables for instruments that attach to a mixer with an xlr cable either will work for your audio connect the mixer output to an audio interface with trs cables to use monitors trs cables are a balanced audio source meaning you ll get less feedback and noise from your inputs and they look like 6 35 mm headphone jacks on the end locate the master output ports near the top of the mixer or on the side by the other ports plug one of the cables into the port labeled l and a second cable in the port labeled r run the cables to your audio interface and plug them into the matching input ports on the back of the interface 4 x research source you can get an audio interface and trs cables online or from a music store interfaces allow you to play the audio from your mixer through speaker monitors or on a computer plug headphones into the phones port on the mixer listening to your mixer through headphones allows you to hear the levels clearly so you can tweak them later on use a 6 35 mm headphone jack to plug in your headphones to the mixer make sure the headphone cord doesn t tangle around any of the knobs 5 x research source you don t need to use headphones if you don t want to turn on your mixer using the power switch the power switch is usually on the back of the mixer or on the top right by the other knobs check that all of the volume and fader controls are still turned down before flipping the switch to turn it on you will see a light turn on as soon as the power is connected 6 x research source some mixers may have a switch labeled phantom which supplies electricity to microphones that require it if you have a microphone that uses phantom power also turn on the switch turn the main volume so it s at 0 db the main volume control will have numbers printed on the side so you can easily see its output level push the slider or turn the knob so it points at 0 db which is usually the middle setting avoid putting the main volume any louder or else the audio will sound muffled and you won t be able to hear channels clearly 7 x research source you won t be able to hear anything through speakers or headphones yet because the faders on each channel are still turned down balance the channel faders so you can hear all of the inputs clearly start by pushing the slider or turning the knob clockwise on one of the channels you re using continue turning up the faders for each channel that has an input attached to it so you can hear them through your speakers or headphones test the inputs at the same time to see if you can hear each microphone or instrument in the mix raise or lower the fader levels until you can hear each source of audio 8 x research source don t turn the fader more than ¾ to the maximum volume since it could create interference and make the audio sound muffled change the treble mid and bass to adjust which frequencies come through each channel on your mixer has a column of knobs that control the treble mid and bass levels for your channel the treble knob controls the high frequencies the bass knob adjusts the lowest frequencies and the mid knob changes everything in between listen to the audio input on the channel as you adjust the knobs to see how it changes the sound 9 x research source if the channel has a microphone attached to it lower the bass and raise the treble to make it sound more prominent if the channel has an instrument try adjusting each of the knobs and playing the instrument to see how it affects the sound there are no perfect levels for your mix since it depends on the audio sources and the sound you re looking for use the gain knobs to continue increasing the volume of specific channels the gain knobs are usually located at the top of each channel and are labeled gain slowly adjust the gain knob for the channel that you want to boost the audio for and test it compared to the rest of the instruments to see if you can clearly hear it 10 x research source you don t need to raise the gain for every input you re using if you do all of the audio sources will sound muffled adjust the pan knobs to put the channel s audio in the left or right speaker the pan knobs control the balance between the left and right speakers and they are usually located directly above the channel faders when the knob points down the middle the audio will play equally through the left and right speakers turn the knob left if you want the audio to be more prominent from the left side or set it right if you want to hear it more on the right side continue adjusting the pan for each channel if you leave all of your audio sources panned in the middle then the mix may sound flat you can turn the knob slightly away from the middle if you want the input to come through both speakers but be more prominent in one of them press the mute button on a channel to turn off its audio look near the channel fader for a small button labeled mute when you click the button the audio from all the other channels will continue going through the mixer while the selected channel will be quiet when you want the audio to go through your mixer again press the mute button to start the audio 11 x research source pressing the audio won t make the original input source stop working but you won t be able to hear it through the speakers or headphones attached to the mixer you can mute multiple tracks at the same time if you want to click the solo button on a channel to isolate it look next to the mute button for another that s labeled solo when you press the solo button every other channel will mute so you can only hear the channel you selected when you want to start the other inputs press the solo button a second time to turn it off 12 x research source soloing a channel on a mixer allows you to easily make adjustments to specific instruments or vocals without lowering the faders on the other channels you can solo multiple channels at the same time use an auxiliary channel to send an audio signal to another source auxiliary channels work well when you need to send copies of audio to specific monitors or put effects on them plug the monitor or effects rig into one of the ports on your mixer labeled aux to start using the labeled auxiliary port turn the knob labeled aux on the channel you want to send to adjust the volume level of the input 13 x research source make sure you re using the auxiliary knob that matches the auxiliary channel you re plugged into you can send multiple channels to an auxiliary channel for example you may use an auxiliary channel if you re a singer and want to hear the drums and guitars in a monitor so you stay on beat,Computers-and-Electronics

how to hook up a crossover,a crossover is an audio signal processing unit that separates a single stereo audio signal into two three or sometimes even four frequency ranges at a minimum a crossover ensures that the high frequency signal i e the treble goes primarily to your tweeter speakers while the low frequency signal i e the bass goes to your woofers or subwoofers using a crossover in your speaker setup can greatly improve sound quality by isolating frequency groups to specific speakers or speaker drivers thus creating more clarity there are two types of crossovers passive crossovers which are the easiest to install and active crossovers which are a little trickier more costly and require the use of multiple amplifiers but give you more control over your sound 1 x research source these instructions will help you hook up either type of crossover for your home stereo or a pa system,unplug your speakers if there are speakers currently wired up to your stereo system fully disconnect them connect the amplifier output to the crossover using speaker wire or rca cables depending on your stereo system and crossover unit connect the crossover to your amplifier just as you would a speaker the crossover should be the last piece of equipment in the chain before the speakers depending on your setup this means your crossover could be wired directly between your amplifier and your speakers or the crossover could be placed in line after a compressor or equalizer 2 x research source depending on your crossover and stereo setup you will probably need separate crossover units for the left and right channels of your stereo system connect the output of the amplifier to the crossover inputs by attaching speaker wires to the positive and negative terminals of your amplifier and the corresponding inputs of the crossover use the red wire for the positive terminal black for the negative slide the exposed wire ends into place and tighten the terminals depending on your amplifier and crossover unit this can be done either by flipping small switches above the terminals or by tightening screws with either a screwdriver or allen wrench if there is not enough exposed wire at ends of your speaker wires you may need to strip off up to half an inch of insulation with wire strippers connect the crossover output to the speakers attach your speakers to the crossover using speaker wire similarly to the previous step your crossover should have separate outputs for your woofers bass speakers and tweeters treble speakers make sure to wire the correct speaker into the correct output on many models of crossover they will be labeled w and w for the woofer positive and negative outputs and t and t for the tweeter test it out once you ve wired the left and right channels play some music through your system you should a clean sound from both channels if your crossover is adjustable and you aren t happy with the sound you re getting try adjusting the frequency knobs or consult the instructions for recommended settings unplug your speakers if you have speakers already connected to your stereo fully disconnect them mount the crossover active crossover units are larger than passive ones and need to be mounted in a stable location ideally near your amplifiers 3 x research source do not mount your crossover directly to a metal rack as this can cause buzzing and other sound problems connect the crossover to your receiver using the appropriate cables wire your crossover into the receiver or preamp with the wires coming out of the receiver going into the in terminals on the crossover depending on your receiver and your stereo system you will probably be making this connection with rca cables but some crossovers will are set up to use speaker wire instead as detailed in method 1 if your receiver doesn t have rca outputs 4 x research source crossovers designed for pa systems sometimes use quarter inch cables like those used to plug in an electric guitar or xlr cables like those used to plug in a microphone 5 x research source connect the crossover to your amplifiers using the appropriate cables again usually rca or speaker wire for a home stereo system connect the appropriate outputs to the appropriate amplifiers if you don t have a subwoofer you ll send your high frequency signal to your tweeter amp and low frequency signal to your woofer amp in this case make sure your crossover is set to two way mode there should be a switch that controls this if you can t locate it check your instruction manual connect the left output of each frequency range to the left input of the coinciding amplifier and the right output of each frequency range to the right input of the coinciding amplifier hook up your subwoofer if you have one there are several ways to hook up a subwoofer to your system whichever you choose you ll need to set up your crossover so that the mid frequency signal is being sent to the woofers but the low frequency signal is not 6 x research source one approach is to use additional cables from your crossover to your subwoofer or subwoofer amplifier if your subwoofer doesn t have it s own power in this scenario you ll set the crossover to three way mode if you re connecting to separate woofers and tweeters or the two way mode if you are running the main speakers with a full range signal and just sending the bass to the subwoofer 7 x research source another approach is to run cables directly from the subwoofer out sub out terminals of your receiver if you have a newer receiver it may have its own crossover settings for a subwoofer so you won t need to use an external crossover for this 8 x research source if your receiver does not have subwoofer settings your subwoofer itself most likely has a built in crossover these typically will not provide the optimum sound but are easy and convenient and also allow you to skip the external crossover unit 9 x research source if you are hooking up your subwoofer to an external crossover turn the subwoofer s built in crossover to its maximum rotation to remove it from the circuit having multiple crossovers functioning at once can make the bass input uneven or erratic 10 x research source avoid connecting subwoofers with speaker wire it doesn t handle bass signals as well as sturdier cables 11 x research source connect the crossover s power and turn the unit on active crossovers require power to function home stereo and pa system crossovers usually just plug into an outlet while car stereo units like the one shown in the video below need to be connected to the car s power supply through the fuse box or in some cases the amplifier will have a terminal for sending power to a crossover 12 x research source tune your system at this stage you ll want to fine tune your system to get a sound you like the manual for your crossover should have some tips for doing this but you can also follow the guidelines below at the beginning of the this process make sure the input gain on your crossover is turned all the way down if it has an input gain knob set your amplifier gains low and if you have an equalizer turn it off or set the levels all flat 13 x research source turn on the system and play some music that you are familiar with this way you ll have a good sense of what you think the music is meant to sound like slowly turn up the input gain on the crossover until sound comes out of all your speakers adjust the level for each output on the crossover until the frequencies are playing at an equal volume as every crossover model is different you should consult your manual for details on how to do this as well as the manufacturer s recommended settings one by one turn up your amplifiers gains until the music begins to distort a little then roll them back to just below the distortion threshold readjust the crossover frequencies as necessary to restore balance between the frequencies turn on your equalizer and begin making adjustments to the sound to suit your personal preferences make any adjustments you want on your receiver as well e g the tone etc again readjust the crossover frequencies until the sound is balanced keep fine tuning your adjustments on the receiver equalizer and crossover until you get a sound mix you like,Computers-and-Electronics

how to set up a sound board,a soundboard also known as a mixing board mix console or sound desk is a complex and sometimes intimidating piece of equipment here is a very basic guide to setting up a mixing board for a small live show with a basic bare bones pa system setup before we get to the step by step portion it is necessary to understand the basic layout of a sound board a mixing board has two main sections the input section and the output or master section the input section is made up of a number of separate channels there can be anywhere from four channels on a mixing board to upwards of thirty two each channel consists of a set of inputs on the back of the board and a corresponding set of controls which together are called a channel strip a channel strip generally consists of a gain or trim control which controls the volume at the first stage as the signal enters the desk before any processing can or routing be done a channel fader which controls the volume after the processing one or more auxiliary sends which function like faders except they send to alternate outputs on the sound board which are used for effects such as reverb or echo and for monitor speakers a set of equalizer or eq controls which control the tonal quality of the bass and treble and often mid range as well bus or group assignment buttons that send the signal to alternate bus faders and outputs in the master section of the board the master section controls the output of the mixing board to various different outputs on the back of the desk the output section of a sound board generally consists of a master fader which controls the volume of the main outputs on the board in other words it s the master volume for the whole system auxiliary masters which control the volume of the auxiliary outputs auxiliary returns which are used to bring the signal from a reverb unit or other outboard effect into the mix without having to use up a channel strip bus faders which are alternate master faders for bus outputs which are used for alternate speakers recording devices and for grouping channels together,chose a location for your sound board this is important because sound volume decreases as you get further away from the source of the sound and the way that sound reflects off surfaces in the room you want to be in a place where you are far enough away from the speakers that you don t have sound blasting directly in your face all night but close enough that you don t end up turning the mix up way too loud because you can t hear it at the back of the room you will also need to consider the length of your mic cables and the location of the electrical outlets in the room set your speakers and power amps in place plug in your speakers connect cables from the output jacks on the power amp to the input jacks on your speakers note if you have powered speakers speakers that have a power amp built into them you can treat all references to power amps as referring to the speakers themselves as the amp and speaker are already connected plug in your power amps connect cables from the main out jacks on the mixer to the input jacks for your power amp or powered speakers connect your monitors if you have monitor speakers on stage for the musicians to hear themselves connect cables from the auxiliary output jacks nearly always labeled aux out on the sound board to the input on the power amp for your monitors note most sound boards have more than one auxiliary output so make sure to keep track of which ones you use for which amp speaker build your stage setup set up your microphones and stands as needed along with any di direct input boxes you need for instruments to plug directly into the pa system such as an acoustic guitar or a keyboard make an input list write down a numbered list of each mic or di box on the stage from left to right when standing at the desk for example 1 guitar di 2 keyboard di 3 kim s vocal mic label the sound board take a strip of painter s tape and place it on the sound board just below the faders use a marker to copy your input list on to the tape so that each fader has one item under it you may have to use abbreviations in order to fit these labels in the space under each fader write vox instead of vocal mic for example cable your mics connect your mic cables to each mic and di box using your input list from step 7 as a guide in our previous example you would connect a cable from input 1 on the sound board to the di box for the guitar input 2 connects to the keyboard di and so on note many small format sound boards allow you to connect a 1 4 instrument cable directly to the mixer without the need for a di box this jack would be labeled line in not to be confused with a jack labeled inst which would stand for insert point not instrument zero the board make sure all of your faders are down as well as your auxiliary sends and gain or trim controls on each channel if the sound board has bus assignment controls make sure that the main mix button for each channel is pressed down and all other bus assignments are up power on your sound board first and then your power amps turn on your outputs bring the master fader up as well as the master controls for any auxiliary sends you are using you don t want to bring these controls all the way up if there is a 0 or unity mark next to your master fader start with it just below that check your sound have somebody speak into one of your microphones while you very slowly move that microphone s corresponding fader up if the fader is up and the volume is too quiet slowly raise the gain or trim control for that channel until you are satisfied with the volume do the same for each microphone and di box until you have verified that everything is working check your monitors while someone is speaking into a vocal mic slowly raise the auxiliary send control on that channel for the auxiliary send to which you ve connected your monitors aux 1 probably and have them let you know when they can hear themselves through the monitor speakers generally the volume of the monitors should be determined by the musicians as they are the ones listening to them,Computers-and-Electronics
how to make a basic beat in fruity loops,this wikihow teaches you how to create a simple beat in fl studio 12 while fl studio s interface appears complicated at first glance you can use the built in channel rack and piano keyboard to create a simple hip hop or r b style beat,open fl studio double click the fl studio app icon which resembles a yellow pepper doing so will open the fl studio window click file it s in the top left corner of the window a drop down menu will appear select new from template you ll find this option in the middle of the drop down menu a pop out menu will appear to the right select minimal it s in the pop out menu selecting it prompts another pop out menu click basic this is in the last pop out menu doing so will create a new project in fl studio using the basic interface rather than fl studio s more complex one add blank channels to your project before you can add instruments to your track you ll need to place them in the channel rack click below the channel rack section click none at the top of the menu that appears repeat until you have enough channels expand the packs folder click the packs folder on the left side of the window to do so select an instrument you should see a variety of folders appear below the packs folder click one e g drums that you want to open open an instrument sub folder if necessary many instrument folders have additional folders for specific instruments preview an instrument find the name of an instrument that you d like to use then click it once to play it if you like the instrument proceed if you don t like the instrument find another one before continuing drag the instrument onto a blank channel this will add the instrument to the channel rack close the instrument s window when the instrument s mastering window opens just click the x in its corner to close it repeat until you ve added all of your instruments once you have every instrument that you want to use in your channel rack you can proceed with adding the bass you can always add more channels and instruments or replace an existing instrument with another one later determine which drums you want to use if you only placed one drum in your channel rack you ll select that instrument however many beats use a combination of drums e g hat snare and kick meaning that you ll need to select the main bass sound and work your way down from there right click a drum s name doing so prompts a drop down menu click piano roll it s at the top of the drop down menu you should see the piano keyboard interface open find the proper note for the instrument scroll up or down while clicking different keys on the keyboard until you find the proper note for your bass create a beat click to the right of the piano key which represents the note that you want to use then drag the far right side of the colored bar that appears left to shorten it or right to lengthen it each dark vertical bar in the piano view represents half of one second for a typical rap or r b beat you ll want every other bar full add a melody if needed if you want to use varying notes in your beat scroll up or down to select another note then add the beat markers like you did above remove a beat if needed if you accidentally placed a beat marker on the wrong line you can right click it to delete it you can also move beat markers up down left or right by clicking and dragging them from the middle repeat this part with other drums in your channel rack once you re satisfied with the background bass in your track you can move on to adding the final part of your

how to master audio,mastering is the very last step of the mixing process before a song is released the end goal achieves a few different things to make the track sound professional on a variety of speakers to increase the volume of the track to a standardized level and finally just to make the track sound the best it possibly can mastering audio can be a complex process professional engineers spend years perfecting techniques and chains of effects lots of practice and a refined ear can lead to impressive results when rendering a mastered track from a raw track many people use software to master audio and software is easier to work with than analog gear if you re just starting out here are some steps to get started on mastering audio,make you listening space the best it possibly can be to master audio you must be able to accurately hear what is playing back if you are able to try to treat your mixing room with acoustic panels you ll also want studio monitors or open back headphones they may be a bit expensive but they are essential tools it s good to note that you should never use one sole source of audio to mix an entire track whether you are using a pair of headphones or a set of monitors it is always important to reference your mix with multiple sources this ensures your final mix will sound good no matter where it is being played or what is being played on finish your mix down to a single stereo track mixing down means taking all the tracks you ve recorded and exporting them or mixing them to a single stereo track it s important to do try and get your mix sound as good as it possibly can before mastering this means finishing up any panning adjustments and finalizing individual track effects mastering is best utilized not as a track overhaul but rather to serve as a soft glue that brings the whole track together it is better to apply effects using a single stereo track than use the master bus on an entire session the master bus is the master volume channel for all of the tracks you record some engineers decide to apply mastering effects to this channel but it is not advisable for novices make sure you have headroom on all of your faders any channel buss or send needs to stay out of the red you want to make sure nothing in your mix clips while it may not be apparent mastering tends to make imperfections more obvious bounce your track using the the highest bit rate possible if you recorded at the recommended 32 bit rate maintain this quality you can convert the file to the cd standard 16 bit rate once you ve applied your effects and are satisfied with the track set up your mastering project in your new project it is best to have an experimental track side by side with a unmastered mix the goal here is to give yourself something to compare your changes to apply small amount of compression to gain control over the dynamic range of the audio track dynamic range is the amount the song varies from it s lowest volume to it s greatest volume in a master session try setting your compression ratio to 2 1 or less it won t need anything more drastic than that gain reduction should also be under 2db apply a basic equalization equalizing is the art of cutting and balancing all the frequencies in a mix to get the sound you want depending on the quality of the initial mix you don t want to make a lot of drastic changes here experiment with a linear eq until you ve achieved the desired sound remember it is always more desirable to adjust a track to sound good in relation to other songs than just sounding good in a vacuum you want to use more soft cuts when mastering try to avoid sharper cuts and keep those for the mixing process apply multiband compression if needed multiband compressors have the ability to focus on a specific frequency range let s say you have a song where the chorus sounds perfect but the bass needs a little less thump in the verses while an eq cut would fix the problem in the verse it would also mess with the chorus a multiband compressor can target that bass and correct its inconsistencies apply reverb to the track if needed reverb essentially models room spaces and gives the processed audio track more of a live feel reverb will add depth and give the stereo track a warm and complete sound add as much or as little as you d like depending on the effect you are seeking a little goes a long way so experiment as needed apply a limiter limiting the audio to a certain db level will give you more volume and make your final track sound the same volume as other music in your genre begin by setting your limiter at 0 3 db you should notice a definite increase in volume to avoid unnatural unpleasant sounds do not raise the gain too high run through a few final listens after all this work your ears may be in need of a rest take a break and come back later give your mix a few final listens to make sure your it sounds exactly how you would like it to convert your stereo file to 16 bit and 44 1 khz you can do this with your audio mastering program so consult the program instructions for help burn the track to a cd when burning your mastered audio track to a cd set the write speed as low as possible to make sure the quality of audio is as high as possible many engineers burn at 1x or 2x you can then duplicate the burned disk and be assured the sound quality will be replicated,Computers-and-Electronics

how to fix a cassette tape,old audio cassette tapes can run into a number of problems that call for some cassette tape surgery for example the tape might tear and break requiring you to splice it back together another common issue is for the tape to come unraveled from one of the wheel hubs in which case you can splice it to the end of the tape on a new wheel hub from a blank cassette tape either way you can get the job done with a few simple tools and a delicate touch,unscrew the cassette case if it has screws using a small phillips screwdriver use a tiny phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws in the two top corners of the cassette tape set the screws aside somewhere where you won t lose them such as in a small dish or cup 1 x research source if you don t see any screws your cassette is the type that is glued together issues that you will need to take a cassette tape apart to fix include a ripped or broken tape and a tape that has come off one of the wheel hubs pry the cassette apart using a tiny flathead screwdriver if it is glued together insert the edge of the flathead screwdriver into the crack where the front and back pieces of the case are glued together on one side of the cassette work it back and forth in a lever motion along the crack to gently break the two halves apart 2 x research source if you can t pry the cassette case apart with your hands after separating the halves on one side repeat the process with the screwdriver for the other sides of the cassette until you can pull them apart open the cassette tape horizontally so the spools don t fall out place the tape horizontally on a flat surface before you open it up pull the top half off and try to leave the bottom half flat on your work surface 3 x research source this will keep the wheel hubs in place so you don t accidentally drop them out and cause more damage to the tape use small sharp scissors to cut off the damaged ends of the broken tape put the two halves of the cassette tape flat on the cutting board with the insides facing up at you be careful not to uncoil the tape from the wheel hubs 4 x research source carefully trim off as little of the tape as possible so you are only removing the damaged parts of the tape where it ripped and broke this will allow you to tape the two pieces neatly back together 5 x research source if you don t have a pair of small sharp scissors you can carefully cut the damaged ends off using a boxcutter or utility knife and your cutting board depending how much damaged tape you have to cut off there could be a noticeable skip in the audio of the tape after you splice it back together tape one end of the broken tape down on the cutting board straighten out one of the sides of the broken tape flat against the cutting board and carefully tape it down leave the end you trimmed exposed 6 x research source make sure that the broken end of the tape is completely flat and not curling at all so that it is easy to work with when you re splicing the other broken end to it use cellophane tape to splice the two sides of the cassette s tape together carefully line up the end of the other side of the broken tape with the end of the side you just taped down press a piece of cellophane tape down over them to splice them together 7 x research source the spliced pieces will be held down on the cutting board by the cellophane tape at this point peel up the cellophane tape and flip the cassette s tape over on the cutting board use your fingernails to gently peel the cellophane tape up from the cutting board being careful not to unsplice the two halves of the cassette s tape that you just stuck together flip over the tape so you can splice together the other side 8 x research source the sticky side of the cellophane tape and the side of the cassette s tape that has no cellophane tape on it should now be facing upwards towards you put a piece of cellophane tape on the other side of spliced tape double check to make sure the ends of the broken tape are still lined up and stuck together carefully stick a new piece of cellophane tape over the exposed sides of the cassette s tape to finish splicing the broken ends together 9 x research source this should hold the broken tape securely together and limit the chances of it coming undone in the future trim the excess cellophane tape off using a boxcutter or utility knife hold the tape flat against the cutting board carefully trim the excess cellophane tape that is hanging off the sides of the spliced tape right up to the edge of the tape 10 x research source you can now put the cassette tape back together buy a new blank cassette tape to use for parts and open it up purchase a blank cassette that is held together by screws unscrew it using a phillips screwdriver and take it apart just like you did for the cassette tape you want to fix 11 x research source if you have a cassette tape that has come off one of the hubs it is very difficult to reattach it to the same hub using a new wheel tape from a blank cassette that already has tape attached to it will allow you to splice the old tape to it to attach it to a new hub more easily cut the new cassette s tape 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm from the end of the tape the plastic non magnetic end of the tape that secures the magnetic tape to the wheel hub is called the leader tape remove the spool that has the leader tape exposed from the cassette and cut the tape 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm from the end of the leader tape using small sharp scissors 12 x research source this will give you a new spool with a clean cut piece of tape to splice the tape from your old cassette to so that it is attached to the new wheel hub remove the wheel hubs from your old cassette lift out the empty wheel hub and throw it away take out the wheel hub that has the tape spooled around it and set it down in front of you 13 x research source it s best to do this on a cutting board on a flat work surface in front of you splice the tape from the new wheel hub to the tape on the old hub line up the cut end of the new blank tape with the end of the tape from your old cassette tape them carefully together using cellophane tape 14 x research source see the above method for complete instructions on how to splice cassette tape together place the wheel hub back in the cassette case carefully put each wheel hub back into the old cassette so that the holes in the middles of the hubs line up with the holes in the cassette case use a pencil to wind the wheel hubs so the tape is not loose and all over the place 15 x research source you can now reassemble the cassette tape line up the tape with the rollers and pressure pad at the top of the cassette case make sure the tape is spooled tightly so it is straight and flat at the top place the tape over the rollers that are located in each of the top corners put the tape underneath the pressure pad which is in the center of the top of the cassette 16 x research source screw the cassette case together if it has screws snap the two halves of the cassette case back together and place the tiny screws back in the holes in the corners of the case use a small phillips screwdriver to tighten them all the way 17 x research source glue the cassette case together if it doesn t have screws put a small dot of superglue in each corner on the edge of one half of the cassette case snap the two halves of the case together and hold them together for 30 seconds 18 x research source it s best not to glue all the way around the cassette tape just in case you have to take it apart again in the future,Computers-and-Electronics

how to transmit audio with a laser pen,using a simple laser pen pointer a few misc parts and about 15 minutes you can make a simple laser communicator that converts a sound source into light that travels across a room and back into sound with very little quality loss,read things you ll need remove all batteries from the laser connect a clip lead to the inside of the laser pointer where the battery touched usually there is a small spring to which you can attach the clip lead the other end of the battery usually connects to the case of the laser since there are many different styles of laser pointer you may have to experiment with clip lead placement to get the laser to work with the new external battery pack you may also have to hold down the laser s push button switch by wrapping a rubber band or some wire around it test the connection before you attach the transformer to make sure the laser works with the new battery pack if it doesn t light try reversing the battery battery reversal will not harm the laser connect the 1 000 ohm side of the transformer between the battery and the laser the 1 000 ohm side of the transformer has three wires coming from it we only use the outside two wires the inside wire is called a center tap and we do not use it in this circuit test the laser by attaching the battery the laser should operate normally at this point connect the earphone jack to the 8 ohm side of the transformer the schematic of the transmitter looks like this the receiver is the simplest part you simply connect the solar cell to the microphone jack and plug it into the amplifier or stereo phono input it does not matter which way the wires are connected to the solar cell here is the schematic of the receiver make sure the transistor radio is turned off and the laser is on plug the earphone jack of the laser into the earphone socket of the radio connect the solar cell to the amplifier or stereo and turn the volume up until you hear a hissing noise then turn it down slightly until the hiss isn t noticeable the volume control should be fairly high corresponding to an ear splitting level if it was playing music aim the laser across the room so it hits the solar cell you might hear clicks or pops coming from the stereo or amplifier as the laser beam passes over the solar cell this indicates that everything is working fine at this point now carefully turn on the radio and slowly adjust the volume until you hear the radio station voices or music coming from the amplifier across the room the radio should be just audible if the earphone jack is pulled out not loud if you can t hear the sound from the amplifier across the room make sure the laser is shining on the solar cell then try increasing the volume of the amplifier before you increase the volume of the radio at this point you should be hearing the radio station coming in loud and clear in the amplifier across the room put your hand in front of the laser beam to break the connection and notice that the music stops,Computers-and-Electronics

how to use varied time signatures in fruity loops fl studio,this article explains how to use varied time signatures in fruity loops fl studio fl studio is a powerful all round audio software application that encompasses practically all elements of electronic music production arguably the most noticeable limitation is the inability to formally create a song with changes in time signature during the song in simple terms each bar or line of a pop song is commonly set to four beats although this value can easily be altered in fl studio general settings the number of beats per bar remains fixed to the general settings this article presents a workaround that for a well organized user will provide a means to compose and edit music that has frequent time signature changes it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the general controls of fl studio,set your pattern grid to accommodate varied time signatures open up the pattern window left click on the grid menu button with a small 3x3 grid icon next to the word playlist click on line then beat this step allows the user to place bars of music anywhere on the pattern grid beat by beat rather than being confined to a predetermined bar by bar grid from this point on simply ignore the bar count along the top of the pattern and piano roll windows or just use them for general reference they no longer refer to your varied time signatures label your patterns it is good practice to name your patterns according to their content in the case of varied time signatures the content of each pattern includes the number of beats in the bar right click a pattern name to rename it an effective method of neatness is to name your patterns in the following format beats instrument part sub part for example 4 bass chorus buildup 5 drums verse1 crescendo 3 bgd break1 wizz under this system each pattern line should be strictly one specific time signature it is expected that each non identical part and sub part of music would have a separate pattern therefore this should naturally apply to parts with differing time signatures furthermore each pattern should strictly use the relative instrument and part names at all times this is good practice to avoid mixing up patterns or doubling up on channels see warnings below set each pattern to its associated time signature in simple terms this means setting the number of beats per bar do so prior to composition to avoid confusing pattern length problems open up the step sequencer in the top left corner a small digital dial should be visible similar to this left click and drag upwards to set the number of beats per bar for this pattern remember that this should be equal to the number of beats specified in the pattern name,Computers-and-Electronics

how to remove vocals from songs,want to make some karaoke tracks you can learn how to strip the vocal channel out of songs and leave the music while it s somewhat difficult to do this without muddying up the track there are a variety of tips and techniques you can try out to get the best quality audio possible,start with high quality audio tracks if you put low quality files into your editing software it s not going to sound good when you start trying to take stuff out it s important to start with wav or flac files and work from there the results will be a lot more clear than you ll get from a super compressed mp3 file locate the vocals in the mix stereo tracks all have two separate channels with the instruments and vocals spread across them bass guitar and other channels will typically be pushed to one side or the other while vocals are normally placed in the center channel this is done to make them sound centered to isolate them you ll split this center channel and invert one of them how can you tell where the vocals are just listen in good quality headphones if the vocals seem to be coming out of both channels simultaneously they re mixed in the center if not they re to the side that you hear the vocals coming from some styles of music and specific recordings will have different balances between channels if the vocals are shifted to one channel or the other instead of centered it s much easier to remove them songs with a lot of effects may be quite difficult to separate and invert there may be a little echo of the vocals that will be difficult to remove import the audio into the editing software of your choice you can do this basic process in any editing software that allows you to invert tracks for a particular channel while the exact location of the tool for each will vary slightly the basic process is the same for the following programs audacity pro tools ableton reason break the channels into separate tracks in most programs you can break a high quality sound file recorded in stereo into the two tracks you should see a black arrow next to the track title which you can click and select split stereo track you should then have the separate channels to work with individually 1 x research source select one of the channels to invert since they both have vocals embedded in the tracks select either one double click to select the entire track if you want to remove the vocals on the entire song invert the channel once you ve selected the track invert it using the effect function and selecting invert the song might sound a little strange after you play it after inverting the track should sound like it s coming from the sides instead of the middle you should still be able to hear vocals some but don t worry you ll complete the effect when you bounce it back to mono convert the file back to mono combine the two stereo channels back into one channel you should now have one combined track that should have a more diminished amplitude that means the vocals will be massaged out and the instrumentation will be usable you may still hear faint hints of the original singer hiding in the background choose vocal eliminator software vocal eliminator software packages are available on the internet for a variety of prices some vocal eliminator software packages may be downloaded for free but most are available only through a purchase 2 x

usually just open the audio equalizer software and play the music file you want to edit the audio equalizer will remove of the audio tracks automatically adjust the audio equalizer to preserve the bass tones to make sure you don t lose the bass it s important to make a few adjustments set the signal attenuation for 5 db at 200 hz and below on both the left and right channels this will preserve the bass tones understand the concept of channel phase two sound waves moving up and down together are said to be in phase when one of the waves is moving up at the same time as the other wave moves down the waves are said to be out of phase out of phase waves cancel each other out resulting in a flat line of sound 3 x research source flipping the phase on one speaker will cancel the matching signal s waves in the other speaker 4 x research source the efficiency of this as a technique is pretty debatable it may theoretically work but it s not a way to save a song file without vocals find the wires leading into the back of one speaker each speaker usually has two wires going into it one with a positive lead and one with a negative lead usually these are red and white black and red or black and white sometimes they re black and black swap the two wires going into one speaker around where the black wire was connected connect the red wire and move the red wire to the black wire s terminal many modern stereo systems and head phones do not allow you to swap wires on the back of one speaker sometimes the wires are bundled into one wire sleeve the only way to swap the bundled wires is to splice them or re solder the connector use a digital phase processor there are special digital techniques using chips called digital signal processors to do the flipping of the wave inside the stereo or hi fi usually the button is a karaoke button which flips the one side of the stereo image phase if your stereo or app has one of these then just press it and the lead vocals will get very soft or disappear adjust the levels to accommodate for the loss of vocals background vocals are often mixed more to the left or right so these are hard to remove you will have to sing along with them and pretend they are your very own backing choir if you re trying to make a karaoke track flipping phase really affects bass waves so the bass might disappear along with the lead vocals digital dsp karaoke systems will fix this by flipping the phase on only the vocal frequencies try adjusting the levels on your stereo to get it to sound correct sophisticated vocal removal systems or software allow you to decide which frequencies get flipped out of phase,Computers-and-Electronics

how to edit id3 tags,if you collect mp3s from disparate sources your id3 tags are probably in shambles ideally an id3 tag includes information about the mp3 song artist album year genre and track list tags are all id3 tags that you use frequently the problem with downloading music from different sources is that inevitably your id3 tags will end up with some blanks if you re missing information in your mp3 files and you d like to update them here are a couple of ways to do so,open your media player whether you re using itunes media player or a third party music service you ll need to open the program to view the music files in question select your mp3s for editing most programs allow you to click and drag any mp3 files not already in your library into your media player of choice to add them you can also highlight any mp3s you wish to edit right click or two finger click on mac a highlighted file and select play or play with default media player this will bring up your mp3 files in your default program as they are use this as a chance to consolidate all of your mp3 files in the interest of efficiency they should all be in the same location your default music folder is the best bet download relevant album art while most of the tagging you ll do on mp3s is text based you also have the option of adding album art if this appeals to you try searching the album art for your selected mp3s in an image service like google or bing images try to find the highest quality photos possible they may look good in a thumbnail but lower quality photos can become granulated when they expand to fit your screen right click an mp3 file within the media player again depending on what kind of media player you re using your specific process will vary slightly however most media players require you to right click the mp3 file you wish to edit find some version of edit file in the ensuing right click menu and click that option for example itunes has an option entitled get info which opens the mp3 s tag input windows media player s menu on the other hand simply says edit if you re using windows media player and your mp3 files are from a legitimate or primary source you can select find album info which will normally fill in the details of the selected music automatically edit your mp3s information tags include items such as artist name track number in an album and genre of music feel free to edit all of these accordingly fields such as album year and artist can be edited in batches to do this highlight all relevant mp3s in your media player right or control click one of the selected mp3s and select the editing option 1 x research source to ensure maximum accuracy consider looking up the album or track details as you go this is especially helpful when entering the track number details play your mp3s to ensure editing carryover once you finish tagging all of your chosen mp3s exit out of your media player reboot it and try playing some of the edited mp3s the changes should have been saved and you should now have fully tagged mp3 files you should also re sync any mobile devices post editing both to update your library and to ensure that all the tags carry over correctly download an mp3 tagger of your choice mp3 taggers range drastically in terms of quality of interface and functionality but all taggers provide the same basic service automatically filling in your mp3s information en masse you ll probably have to install whichever mp3 tagger you download even if it is an add on be ready to restart your computer after doing so tuneup a highly recommended add on for itunes features a simple drag and drop interface unfortunately the most practical version of the software is 15 while this program is generally worth the money if you don t want to pay the initial fee you ll be restricted to tagging 100 songs and 50 album art pieces a month 2 x research source mp3tag on the other hand is free for windows and mac alike its sparse yet accessible interface is ideal for editing large batches of mp3 files and it is compatible with a huge amount of online databases for tag importing 3 x research source open your mp3 tagger once you ve finished downloading and installing the tagger of your choice open it and familiarize yourself with its settings some programs will allow you to de select any media that isn t an mp3 for the purposes of editing id3 tags you should enable this setting make sure your internet connection is stable since the information mp3 taggers draw from is online based you ll want to have a strong connection to the internet for the entire time that your files are being tagged an ethernet cable connecting you to the router can help expedite this process select your mp3s for tagging locate your mp3s select all that you wish to edit and drag them into your tagger if possible try to keep your mp3s relatively organized in small batches to make sure you don t have a cluster of poorly tagged mp3s going into the tagger all at once you ll want to limit your sample size if something goes wrong in the process use your tagger to import tags since there are tons of available mp3 taggers for you to use there isn t one universal instruction regarding this step however you should be able to view and edit a large amount of mp3 files within the program s interface with the option to scan for and import music tags play your mp3s to ensure editing carryover although most mp3 taggers are fairly accurate there s always the chance that one of your files will be mislabeled you should also re sync any mobile devices post editing both to update your library and to ensure that all the tags carry over correctly,Computers-and-Electronics

how to measure decibels,in common usage decibels are usually a way to measure the volume loudness of a sound decibels are a base 10 logarithmic unit which means that increasing a sound by 10 decibels results in a sound that is twice as loud as the base sound in general terms a sound s decibel value is given by the formula 10log10 i 10 12 where the number one represents the sound s intensity in watts square meter,use your computer with the right programs and equipment it s not difficult to measure the decibel level of a sound using your computer listed below are just a few ways to do this note that better recording equipment will always give you better results in other words while your computer s default internal microphone may be sufficient for some tasks a high quality external microphone will be much more accurate if you re on windows 8 try downloading the free decibel reader app from the microsoft app store the app uses your computer s microphone to read noises up to 96 decibels similar devices are available from the itunes app store for apple products 2 x research source you can also try using a third party program to measure decibels for instance audacity a free sound recording program includes a simple built in decibel meter use a mobile app for measuring sound levels on the go mobile apps can be extremely convenient though the microphone on your mobile device isn t as likely to be as high quality as the sorts of external mics you can connect to a computer they can be surprisingly accurate for instance it s not uncommon for readings from mobile apps to be within 5 decibels of the readings from professional equipment 3 x research source below is a brief list of decibel reading apps available for common mobile platforms for apple devices decibel 10th decibel meter pro db meter sound level meter for android devices sound meter decibel meter noise meter decibel for windows phones decibel meter free cyberx decibel meter decibel meter pro use a professional decibel meter though it s not usually cheap perhaps the most direct accurate way to find the decibel level of a sound you with to analyze is to use a decibel meter also called a sound level meter this specialized tool available from online retailers and specialty stores uses a sensitive microphone to measure the amount of noise in the environment and give you a precise decibel value since there isn t generally a large market for these tools they can be somewhat expensive often at least 200 even for low cost models 4 x research source note that decibel meters sound level meters can go by other names for instance another type of tool called a noise dosimeter performs basically the same function as a standard sound level meter find your sound s intensity in watts square meter for everyday practical purposes decibels are usually seen as a simple measure of loudness however the truth is a little more complex in physics decibels are often thought of as a convenient way of expressing the intensity of a sound wave the larger the amplitude of a given sound wave the more energy it transmits the more it moves the air particles in its path and the more intense the sound is 5 x research source because of this direct relationship between a sound wave intensity and its volume in decibels it s possible to find a decibel value given nothing more than an intensity level for the sound which is typically measured in watts square meter note that for ordinary sounds the intensity value is usually very small for instance a sound with an intensity of 5 10 5 or 0 00005 watts square meter translates to about 80 decibels about the volume of a blender or food processor to better understand the relationship between intensity measurements and decibels let s follow along with an example problem for the purposes of this problem let s say that we re music producers and we re trying to find the background noise level in our recording studio to improve the sound of our records after setting up our equipment we detect a background noise intensity of 1 10 11 0 00000000001 watts square meter in the next few steps we ll use this info to find the decibel level of the background noise in our studio divide by 10 12 once you ve found the intensity of your sound you can simply plug it into the formula 10log10 i 10 12 where i is your intensity in watts square meter to find its decibel value to begin divide by 10 12 0 000000000001 10 12 represents the intensity of a 0 decibel sound so by comparing your intensity value to this you re essentially finding its relationship to this base value in our example we d divide our intensity value 10 11 by 10 12 to get 10 11 10 12 10 take the log10 of your answer and multiply by 10 to finish solving all you need to do is take the base 10 logarithm of your answer then finally multiply by 10 this accounts for the fact that decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10 in other words an increase of 10 decibels means that the loudness of the sound has doubled our example is easy to solve log10 10 1 1 10 10 therefore the background noise in our studio has a loudness of 10 decibels this is quite quiet but still detectable with our high quality recording equipment so we ll probably need to eliminate the source of the noise for the best recordings understand the logarithmic nature of decibel values as noted above decibels are logarithmic units with a base of 10 for any given decibel value a noise 10 decibels greater is twice as loud a noise 20 decibels greater is 4 times as loud and so on this makes it easy to describe the huge range of sound intensities that can be picked up by the human ear the loudest sound the ear can hear without experiencing pain is more than one billion times more intense than the quietest noise it can detect 6 x research source by using decibels we avoid having to use huge numbers to describe common sounds instead we only need to use three digit numbers at most consider this which is easier to use 55 decibels or 3 10 7 watts square meter the two are equivalent so rather than having to use scientific notation or a very small decimal decibels allow for us to use a sort of simple shorthand for easy everyday use,Computers-and-Electronics

how to measure speaker impedance,speaker impedance is a measure of a speaker s resistance to an alternating current the lower the impedance the more current the speakers will draw from the amplifier if impedance is too high for your amplifier the volume and dynamic range will suffer too low and the amp could destroy itself trying to produce enough power if you re just confirming the general range of your speakers all you need is a multimeter if you want to conduct a more accurate test you ll need some specialized tools,check the label for a nominal impedance rating most speaker manufacturers list an impedance rating on the speaker label or the packaging this nominal impedance rating usually 4 8 or 16 ohms is an estimate of the minimum impedance for typical audio ranges this usually occurs at a frequency between 250 and 400 hz the actual impedance is fairly close to this value within this range and rises slowly as you increase the frequency below this range the impedance changes rapidly peaking at the resonant frequency of the speaker and its enclosure 1 x research source some speaker labels display an actual measured impedance for a specific listed impedance to give you an idea of what these frequencies mean most bass tracks fall between 90 and 200 hz while chest thumping sub bass can be as low as 20 hz the midrange including the majority of non percussion instruments and voices covers 250 hz to 2khz 2 x research source set a multimeter to measure resistance a multimeter sends out a small dc current to measure resistance since impedance is a quality of ac circuits this will not measure impedance directly however this approach will get you close enough for most home audio setups for example you can easily distinguish between a 4 ohm and 8 ohm speaker this way use the lowest range resistance setting this is 200ω for many multimeters but a multimeter with a lower setting 20ω may give more accurate results if there is only one setting for resistance your multimeter is auto ranging and will find the correct range automatically too much dc current can damage or destroy the voice coil of a speaker 3 x research source the risk is low here since most multimeters only produce a small current 4 x research source remove the speaker from its cabinet or open the back of the cabinet if you re dealing with a loose speaker with no connections or speaker box then there is nothing you need to do here cut off the power to the speaker any power running to the speaker will ruin your measurement and could fry your multimeter turn off the power if the wires connected to the terminal are not soldered on detach them do not remove any wires connected directly to the speaker cone connect the multimeter leads to the speaker terminals look closely at the terminals and determine which is positive and which is negative there is often a and a sign to identify them connect the multimeter s red probe to the positive side and the black probe to the negative side estimate the impedance from the resistance typically the resistance reading should be roughly 15 less than the nominal impedance on the label 5 x research source for example it s normal for an 8 ohm speaker to have a resistance between 6 or 7 ohms the majority of loudspeakers have a nominal impedance of 4 8 or 16 ohms unless you get a strange result it s safe to assume your speaker has one of these impedance values for the purpose of pairing it with an amplifier get a tool that generates a sine wave a speaker s impedance varies with frequency so you ll need a tool that allows you to send out a sine wave at any given frequency an audio frequency oscillator is the most accurate option any signal generator or function generator with a sine wave or sweep function will work but some models may give inaccurate results due to changing voltages or poor sine wave approximation 6 x research source if you are new to audio tests or diy electronics consider audio testing tools that connect to a computer these are often less accurate but novices may appreciate the auto generated graphs and data 7 x research source connect the tool to an amplifier input look for the power on the amp label or spec sheet in watts rms higher power amplifiers produce more accurate measurements with this test 8 x research source set the amp to a low voltage this test is part of a standard series of tests to measure the thiele small parameters all of these tests were designed for low voltages 9 x research source lower the gain on your amp while a voltmeter set to ac voltage is connected to the amp s output terminals ideally the voltmeter should read somewhere between 0 5 and 1 v but if you don t have sensitive tools just set it to below 10 volts some amps produce inconsistent voltage at low frequencies which is a common source of inaccuracy in this test for best results check with the voltmeter to make sure the voltage stays constant as you adjust the frequency using the sine wave generator use the highest quality multimeter you can afford the inexpensive models tend to be less accurate for the measurements later in this test it may help to purchase higher quality multimeter leads at an electronics store 10 x research source www sbacoustics com index php download_file view 191 choose a high value resistor find the power rating in watts rms closest to your amplifier s on the list below choose a resistor with the recommended resistance and the listed wattage rating or higher the resistance doesn t need to be exact but if it s too high you may clip the amplifier and disrupt the test too low and your results will be less accurate 11 x research source 100w amp 2 7k ω resistor rated to at least 0 50w 90w amp 2 4k ω 0 50w 65w amp 2 2k ω 0 50w 50w amp 1 8k ω 0 50w 40w amp 1 6k ω 0 25w 30w amp 1 5k ω 0 25w 20w amp 1 2k ω 0 25w measure the exact resistance of the resistor this may vary slightly from the printed resistance write down the measured value connect the resistor and speaker in series hook the speaker up to the amplifier with the resistor between them this creates a constant current source powering the speaker keep the speaker away from obstructions wind or reflected sound waves could disrupt this sensitive test at minimum keep the speaker magnet side down cone up in a windless area if high accuracy is required bolt the speaker to an open frame with no solid objects within 2 ft 61 cm in any direction 12 x research source calculate the current using ohm s law i v r or current voltage resistance calculate the current and write it down use the resistor s measured resistance for r for example if the resistor has a measured resistance of 1230 ohms and the voltage source is 10 volts the current i 10 1230 1 123 amps you can leave this as a fraction to avoid rounding errors adjust the frequency to find the resonance peak set the sine wave generator to a frequency at the mid or upper range of the speaker s intended use 100 hz is a good starting point for bass units place an ac voltmeter across the speaker adjust the frequency downward about 5 hz at a time until you see the voltage rise sharply tweak the frequency back and forth until you find the frequency where the voltage is highest this is the resonance frequency of the speaker in free air an enclosure and surrounding objects will change this you can use an oscilloscope instead of a voltmeter in this case find the voltage associated with the greatest amplitude calculate the impedance at resonance you can substitute impedance z for resistance in ohm s law calculate z v i to find the impedance at resonance frequency this should be the maximum impedance your speaker will encounter in the intended audio range for example if i 1 123 amps and the voltmeter measures 0 05v or 50mv then z 0 05 1 123 6 15 ohms calculate impedance for other frequencies to find the impedance across the speaker s intended frequency range adjust the sine wave in small increments record the voltage at each frequency and use the same calculation z v i to find the speaker s impedance at each frequency you may find a second peak or the impedance may be fairly steady once you get away from the resonance frequency,Computers-and-Electronics
how to extend speaker wires,splice up your life with some vinyl tape and wire nuts,turn off the system and disconnect the electrical wall plug disconnect your speaker wire from the back of your stereo or home entertainment amplifier and examine the wire the wire for each speaker should actually be two wires consisting of a stranded metal core covered by a flexible insulation one strand is the positive the other strand is the ground these usually are identified in someway for example one may have a bump along the length of the insulation another a white line and yet another may have a copper colored wire while the other wire is silver this way you can identify the positive and negative wires the end of each wire should already be separate or split forming a y shape of only a few inches the tips of each y should already be stripped exposing about a half inch of the bare metal strands purchase a roll of wire in the same gauge as your speaker wire speaker wire is available in an assortment of thickness or gauges this may be marked on the wire or you may find it in literature for your home amplifier make your best approximation if you cannot determine the exact gauge purchase several wire connectors or wire nuts matching the wire gauge and a roll of vinyl electricians tape cut the new wire measure the distance needed to extend your speakers existing wire cut one length of new wire based on each of your measurements prepare the ends of each wire split a few inches of each end of the new wire forming a y shape strip the insulation from the tip of each strand exposing about a half inch of the bare metal strands connect splice the new wire to the existing wire and insulate there are a few methods to do this the best connection is made by soldering the wires and putting heat shrink tubing around the solder point other methods are the use of wire nuts or crimped connectors soldering or crimping requires the use of a soldering iron or crimping tool without access to these specialized tools wire nuts are the best choice pick up the prepared end of the new wire and the end of the existing wire you should be holding four exposed metal tips match the existing positive wire to the new positive wire there may be a marking on the insulation to indicate positive the metal strands may be a different color to indicate positive make the electrical connection if using heat shrink tubing slide a piece of tubing long enough to cover the solder connection onto one of the wires before making the connection for wire nuts in one hand hold together one exposed tip of your existing wire and one exposed tip of your new wire position these exposed tips side by side held between your thumb and forefinger with the other hand place a wire connector over the merged tips twist clockwise inside the connector the bare metal tips will twist together and screw firmly into the connector the connector will insulate this splice for soldering twist together the exposed tips and perform the soldering process for crimping feed the prepared ends of the wire into the wire connector and crimp the end there are many products to do this some look like wire nuts that are crimped and some look and operate completely differently read the directions for the particular connectors you have purchased repeat this step for the ground wire of the set each wire should now have two splices wrap a length of vinyl electricians tape around each set of wires or slide the shrink tubing to cover the wire connectors slightly stretch the tape as you wrap so that it adheres neatly to the insulation before and after the splice to shrink the tubing you will need a heat gun to evenly heat the tubing repeat this step for each set of speaker wires connect bare ends of newly extended speaker wire to your amplifier usually you insert the positive wire in a red connection insert the ground wire in a black connection plug your system back into the electrical power and turn the system on and enjoy the music or movie,Computers-and-Electronics
how to install tweeters,tweeters are a special type of loudspeaker that are designed to produce high frequency sounds that dramatically improve a car s stereo system quality although you may be nervous about installing speakers in your car it s actually a pretty simple process all you have to do is mount a base cup on or underneath an existing speaker grille place your tweeter inside the base cup then wire it to your car s stereo crossover,disconnect the negative terminal from the car battery to cut the power turn off the car s ignition before opening the hood and interacting with the battery use a wrench to loosen the nut on the negative end of the battery marked by a then detach the black negative cable from the battery doing this will help prevent a possible short circuit during the tweeter installation process which could damage your car s other electronic components 1 x research source for safety wear insulated gloves that will protect you from any charge the battery might give off you should also wear safety goggles when working with a car battery in case any of the corrosive materials inside the battery begin to leak remove the necessary panels to gain access to your car s speakers if you plan to mount your speakers under your dashboard or inside a car door you ll need to remove the dashboard panel or door panel before you can proceed use a screwdriver to remove any screws that are keeping the panel attached to the body of the car then use a wide flat putty knife to pry the panel away 2 x research source note that this step isn t necessary if you plan to surface mount your tweeters the screws on a door panel are most likely located underneath the door lever and underneath the arm rest the locations of the screws on your dashboard vary based on the make and model of your car check your user s manual for specific instructions on how to locate these screws and remove your dashboard install the tweeter in the dash for an easy bottom mount installation in a bottom mount installation the tweeter is placed underneath an existing speaker grille meaning you don t need to drill any new holes to install it simply use a wrench to screw the tweeter into the factory installed holes underneath the grille 3 x research source note that if your car doesn t have holes underneath the speaker grille that you can screw your tweeter into you ll need to drill those holes yourself these will only need to be about 0 25 inches 0 64 cm deep or so in order to give the screws enough space to be securely attached mount the tweeter in the door panel to put the sounds closer to you flush mounting a tweeter in the door panel is the most common installation method first drill a hole into the door panel that is almost exactly as wide as the tweeter then slide the base cup which holds the tweeter in place into the hole so that it is snugly secure in the panel finally attach the tweeter to the base cup 4 x research source refer to the instructions that came with your base cup to see how precisely to attach the tweeter to it most cups simply require you to pop the tweeter into it while others may have you use a screw to attach it ideally you should drill into the door panel after it has been removed from the door itself to avoid inadvertently damaging anything behind the panel if your door panel has an existing speaker grille in place this is the best location for your tweeter however if there s no grille on your car door then feel free to install your tweeter wherever you want high frequency sound to come from this method of installation is called flush mounting because the top of the tweeter sits flush with the surface that it s mounted on opt for a surface mount if you can t put the tweeter anywhere else use a power drill to drill a small hole in your car s speaker grille this will be the hole that you ll stick the speaker wires through to wire your tweeter to the crossover then use a screwdriver to screw the base cup into the grille with a pair of screws then attach the tweeter to the base cup by sliding it in so that it s snugly secure inside the cup 5 x research source avoid drilling the hole in the grille to deep as you may cause unwanted damage to the speaker system you only need to create an opening in the grille just big enough for speaker wires to pass through surface mounting is a useful installation method for when there aren t a lot of deep places in your car where you can drill new holes for installing tweeters the most common location for surface mounted tweeters is on the a pillar which stands between your windshield and your front door window locate the crossover in your car the stereo system in your car has a built in crossover that filters the different frequencies that come through your speakers crossover locations vary based on different car models so you ll need to look in your owner s manual to find your crossover s specific location 6 x research source most stereo crossovers are located inside the car door panel connect the speaker wires to the crossover unscrew the caps on the 2 binding posts on the crossover labeled highpass insert the speaker wires into the holes in these posts connecting the positive and negative wires to the positive and negative posts finally screw the caps back onto the binding posts to secure the wires in place 7 x research source your speaker wires will most likely be color coded to indicate which is positive and which is negative in most cases the wire with the stripe is the negative wire and the wire with the solid color is the positive wire attach the speaker wires to your tweeter unscrew the caps on the binding posts on the back of your tweeter and insert speaker wires into the exposed holes screw the caps back onto the posts to secure the wires 8 x research source again make sure you connect the positive and negative wires to their respective binding posts to ensure that the tweeter works correctly repeat this process as necessary to connect other installed tweeters if you installed more than 1 tweeter use additional pairs of speaker wires to connect them to your car s crossover the wires should be attached to the same posts that you attached the first tweeter to note that if you have more than 2 tweeters in total you may need to have an additional crossover installed in order to ensure all of your tweeters produce the same quality of sound test the tweeters to make sure they work properly reconnect your car s battery then turn on your car s radio and make sure the volume is turned up so that you can hear it listen to the sound coming from your tweeter to make sure there are no unwanted vibrations if the tweeter is vibrating it means it s too loosely attached 9 x research source reattach the panels you removed if applicable if you flush mounted or bottom mounted your tweeters the last thing you need to do to complete the installation is screw the door panel or dashboard back into place once this is done test the tweeters once again to make sure the process of reattaching the panels didn t loosen them up 10 x research source,Computers-and-Electronics
how to install outdoor speakers,want to turn your next bbq into a bonafide dance party setting up an outdoor speaker system may seem daunting but once you get started you ll find that it s a much simpler task than it appears to be setting up the speakers yourself will take an afternoon but you ll save a lot by not calling an electrician to do the work for you you ll be blasting music and annoying your neighbors in less time than you think,set up the receiver indoors most outdoor speaker systems run off an existing indoor receiver since the receiver is a sensitive piece of electronics you almost always want to set the receiver up indoors a multi zone receiver allows you to have music playing outside while something else plays inside install a volume control box outside make sure that it is in a sheltered location you will be running the speaker wire from the receiver to the volume control box and then from the volume control box to the associated speakers most volume control boxes can be easily mounted on an outdoor wall consider multiple volume control boxes for multiple pairs of speakers this will allow you to control the volume across multiple zones install a multi channel amplifier if you are running multiple pairs of speakers each pair you add increases the chance of overloading the receiver s built in amplifier you can install the amplifier right next to the receiver and then run the speaker wire out of the amplifier obtain enough speaker wire 16 gauge is fine for less than 80 feet 24 m but longer wires should be 14 or 12 gauge if you don t use the right gauge for your speakers your audio quality will suffer the longer the wire the more degradation will occur four conductor wire allows you to connect two pairs of speakers with one wire potentially saving you the hassle of running a lot of wire for outdoor speakers cl2 and cl3 speaker wire complies with us in wall standards which means it can be safely ran through walls without causing issues with other electronics or posing a fire risk this wire can also withstand elements which is essential for an outdoor setup add an additional 10 15 to the length for snags and slack you don t want your speaker wire to be pulled tight as crimps in the wire can affect sound quality run your speaker wire from the receiver to the outside area drill a hole low in the wall to run the speaker wire from the inside to the outside make sure to seal the hole with silicone to maintain your house s insulation run the speaker wire to the volume control box and then run a second wire from the box to the speakers don t run speakers through windows or door jambs this can cause your speaker wire to get crimped causing audio issues some modern speaker setups are completely wireless and operate using bluetooth if you are using a setup like this you don t have to worry too much about wiring you just need to ensure that your receiver supports bluetooth speakers and that the speakers are setup relatively close to the receiver bluetooth can reach about 150 feet 45 7 m if there is nothing impeding the signal walls between the receiver and speaker will shorten the effective range place your speakers in sheltered areas even though most outdoor speakers are designed to withstand the elements you will get a lot more life out of them if you protect them a little try to place your speakers under eaves or underneath the patio roof to help protect the speakers from the weather space your speakers out speakers should be about 8 10 feet 2 5 3 m apart if the speakers are too close together the sound will be muddled and the speakers will overlap if the speakers are too far apart it will be difficult to hear and you will lose any stereo effects alternate channels a pair of speakers covers two channels left and right the two of these together creates a stereo sound when installing more than a single pair of speakers it is important to alternate left and right channels to ensure a proper stereo mix this becomes especially important if you are installing a large number of speakers if you are installing more than one speaker along a wall alternate left and right channels along that wall if you are installing speakers in a box around your patio install the two left channels in opposing corners and the two right channels in the other opposing corners listen to the speakers before mounting them make sure that the sound quality and projection is acceptable before mounting the speaker listening before installing can save you a lot of time and headache when you turn the system on for the first time more speakers is better than higher volume if you are having difficulty hearing the sound everywhere you want consider adding another pair of speakers instead of trying to crank the volume to the max mount the speakers high but not too high mounting your speakers high allows the sound to project much further which can give you more coverage for less speakers if you mount them near or above 10 feet 3 m however you will lose a lot of the bass try to keep your speakers between 8 10 feet 2 4 3 0 m off the ground tilt the speakers down to promote drainage this will also provide a better listening experience and help minimize noise pollution for your neighbors most brackets allow you to mount at an angle and many contain swivels that you can position exactly how you want mount according to the instructions the mounting process will vary depending on the type of bracket but you ll usually need to drill into the mounting location this may mean you will need a drill bit that can penetrate masonry only mount speakers on solid wood or masonry avoid mounting on cedar or aluminum siding otherwise the speakers may start to sag this can cause vibrations which will lower the sound quality or the speakers can fall entirely use the included brackets outdoor speaker brackets are already treated for weather if you try to replace the brackets with ones not designed for outdoor use they may rust and become weak connect speakers using banana plugs these provide a much more reliable connection than bare wire which is essential for outdoor speakers banana plugs connect directly into the speaker wire clips on the back of the speaker and receiver to install banana plugs you will need to strip the end of the speaker wires each speaker wire has two wires a red and a black pull them apart to separate them and give you some room to work each of these will need to be stripped about 3 4 of an inch from the end of the wire once the wire is stripped unscrew the end of the banana plug and slip the exposed wire into the end once the wire is inserted tighten the banana plug screw repeat this for the other exposed wire check your speaker and receiver specifications there are a variety of factors that could potentially be causing your speakers to sound distorted or fuzzy mismatched equipment is one of the most common factors check that the amplifier and receiver support the ohms that the speakers draw and that the speakers can handle the wattage output of the amplifier check the documentation for all of your equipment to ensure that everything matches check the connections if you ve accidentally swapped the positive and negative wires on your speakers you likely will not hear anything coming out of them double check all of your connections and ensure that the black cables are inserted in black clips while the red cables are inserted in the red clips 1 x research source if the speaker is too far away and you aren t using a proper gauge wire you can experience a lot of distortion try to move the speaker closer to the receiver and then shorten the wire or run newer lower gauge wire crossed wires can short out your speakers and cause serious damage make sure the black and red wires are not touching when bare at the ends look for physical damage check that the speakers are not physically damaged a blown out speaker can sound terrible so ensure that the woofers on the speaker aren t torn if you see any physical damage try replacing the speaker,Computers-and-Electronics
how to power two speakers with a one channel amp,if you have two speakers you want to power from a single channel amplifier the first thing you should do is determine the output impedance of the amplifier and the impedance of your speakers ideally the output impedance of the amplifier should match the impedance of the speakers if you can make the impedances match you ll be able to successfully use your speakers with the amplifier,if you connect the speakers in series you re adding the speaker impedances together example you have two 8 ohm speakers you want to connect to an amplifier with an output impedance of 16 ohms for this case you want to put your speakers in series so the total impedance of the speakers will be 8 8 16 ohms matching the amplifier plug the negative terminal of the amplifier into the negative terminal of the first speaker connect the positive terminal of the first speaker to the negative terminal of the second speaker connect the positive terminal of the second speaker to the positive terminal of the amplifier for a parallel connection of two speakers the resulting impedance is half of the impedance of the speakers assuming the speakers have the same impedance example you have the same two speakers but the amplifier has a 4 ohm output for this case you want to connect the speakers in parallel because the impedance would be 8 2 4 ohms again matching the amplifier plug the negative terminal of the amplifier to the negative terminal of speaker 1 hook the negative of speaker 1 to the negative on speaker 2 plug the positive terminal of the amplifier to the positive terminal of speaker 1 hook the positive of speaker 1 to the positive on speaker 2,Computers-and-Electronics
how to use banana plugs,banana plugs attach to either end of a speaker wire making it easy to plug and unplug your speaker and receiver they re named banana plugs because they re wider in the middle of the plug and narrower at the top and bottom similar to the shape of a banana and they plug into banana ports on your speaker without these plugs you d have to unwind the bare wires each time you wanted to unplug the component and you would see the bare wire coming out of your speaker components even better installing them yourself is easy,measure enough speaker wire to go from your receiver to your speaker the length of the speaker wire will depend on how far apart you want your speaker components to be when you re measuring leave at least 1 2 ft 0 30 0 61 m of slack in the cable if it s pulled tight when you plug it in the pressure could fray the cable or damage your sound equipment 1 x research source use wire cutters to clip the speaker wire to the length you need the further apart your speaker and receiver will be the more slack you ll need to add find the positive side of the wire speaker wire has 2 sides but the appearance can vary if your wire is black and red the positive side is red if your wire is all the same color look closely at the 2 sides the side with small writing along the insulation is the positive side 2 x research source this is the side you ll attach to the banana plug with the red mark and you ll plug it into the red terminals on your speaker and receiver it s very important to pay attention to the polarity of the wire attaching the positive wire to the wrong terminal could damage your equipment injure you or start a fire strip away 3 4 1 in 1 9 2 5 cm of insulation with your wire cutters most wire cutters have a small notch inside of the blades for stripping away the insulation place your wires into this notch and apply gentle pressure pull upward in a twisting motion hard enough to pull away the insulation without scoring the copper itself do this on both sides of your speaker wire and on both ends for a total of 4 times 3 x research source if your wire cutters don t have that notch use the blades to gently score the wire then use your hands to pull the insulation apart do not cut into the wire itself if you do snip off that portion of the wire and start over only strip as much wire as you need for it to fit snugly into the plug if you strip away too much insulation you might see the exposed copper on the outside of your plug twist the ends of each wire so they don t come apart use your fingers to smooth out the exposed ends of the copper wire make sure all of the wires are facing the same direction then roll them a few times between your fingers to twist them securely together repeat this for all 4 ends 4 x research source do not twist the cable so tightly that it kinks up this could cause it to break solder the end of each wire if you want to ensure your wire will never fray for even more staying power you can solder the tips of each wire hold a piece of solder to the tip of the wire then touch the tip of a hot soldering iron so it touches the solder and the copper at the same time take the soldering iron away after 1 2 seconds and repeat if needed continue until you have soldered each of the 4 ends of the speaker wire 5 x research source keep the soldering iron away from anything flammable and do not touch it to your skin or any other part of your body only apply a small amount of solder on the very end of the wire don t cover up too much of the copper since it s a better conductor than the solder if you don t want to solder the wire twisting it is fine however if you move your speaker components around a lot the wire could start to unravel eventually make sure you have a positive and a negative plug a positive plug will have a red mark or ring that allows you to easily differentiate the positive wire when everything s assembled a negative plug will have a black ring or it might not have any markings if you plug the positive wire into the wrong component you could get shocked or damage your equipment so it s important to use the right plugs for the project 6 x research source you can buy pairs of banana plugs at any store that sells speaker components you can also find them online unscrew the bottom of each banana plug banana plugs can come in different designs but they should all have at least 2 parts a prong or post with a hole where you can put the wire and a sleeve or a screw that you tighten to secure the wire unscrew the first pair of plugs and set them aside being careful to keep the pairs matched 7 x research source set the plugs somewhere secure like in a small dish so they can t roll away if there are screws in the side of the plug loosen them with a screwdriver slide the positive wire into the hole on the red plug feed the twisted or soldered end of the positive wire into the plug keep pushing it into the hole until you feel it make a secure connection with the other side of the plug and the insulation is flush against the outside of the plug the wire has to make contact with the inside of the plug in order for the cable to work 8 x research source the hole for the wire may be on the side or the bottom of the plug if you re not sure check the packaging that came with your banana plugs do not insert insulation into the hole as this can prevent the plug from having a secure connection with the wire if you didn t strip away enough insulation remove the wire from the plug and pull off a little more if there is bare wire showing outside of the hole cut the wire until it fits or wrap the end of the plug with electrical tape place the screw into or onto the plug and tighten it the exact mechanics of this will depend on your banana plug you might have to tighten the screws on the post first with a screwdriver then fit a larger screw into the bottom of the plug or you might slide a sleeve over the plug and tighten it down 9 x research source read the instructions that came with your plug if you re not sure repeat for the negative side of the wire then again for the opposite ends of each wire attach the negative plug to the side you re already working on then go to the other end of the wire and install the other set of plugs again be very careful to identify the positive wire and attach it to the correct plug when you re finished you will have a total of 4 banana plugs attached to your speaker wire 10 x research source push the banana plugs into their respective ports you should see red and black ports or jacks on the speaker and the receiver making it easy to match up the polarity once everything is connected turn on the power to the components if they work properly you re all finished 11 x research source if there are any sparks or you hear sounds like a pop or sizzle immediately turn off the power and double check your work,Computers-and-Electronics
how to wire speakers,each speaker is a little different but most of them will be wired in a similar way this wikihow will show you the most common way of wiring speakers,establish a target listening area perhaps this is a couch love seat or your favorite chair place the target seat in a good position the ideal placement is halfway between the two side walls and at least a couple of feet back from the exact center of the room avoid placing the target seat all the way up against the back wall of the room flat surfaces such as walls tend to shatter the sound a little before reflecting it so you will get a better effect if you leave a buffer between the back wall and the target hang some thick rough textured fabric along the wall behind the target listening area this will help to rectify the distortion of reflected sound place your speakers facing the target area at sixty degree angles they should be at least one foot out from the back wall and at least two feet away from the side wall for optimal sound quality ensure that the speakers and the target listening area are all equidistant this means the distance should be the same between all three parts creating a perfect equilateral triangle use a tape measure or string to determine the distance from your amplifier to your speakers this will tell you how much speaker wire will be required for the job keep in mind that if your speakers and your amplifier are in the same room 16 gauge wire is inexpensive and will be sufficient longer distances require a thicker wire because of the increased risk of a power failure for distances between 80 to 200 feet 24 4 to 61 m you need a 14 gauge wire distances greater than 200 feet 61 m require the thicker 12 gauge wire 12 gauge wire may be used in any speaker setup even if the distance between the amplifier and the speakers is not terribly great some audiophiles swear by the extra quality and durability you get for the price purchase the wire that you have determined is correct for your needs it never hurts to grab a little extra you never know when you might need to extend the wires make sure all your components are completely unplugged no signal should be running through anything while you hook up speakers prepare your wires for connection examine the wire and take note of any differences between coloring on either half is one half of the insulation colored red and the other black is the insulation clear with subtle differences in the colors of the wire beneath this information will be useful later split the wire down the center for a couple of inches then use wire cutters or scissors to trim away the insulation around the first inch of each wire this should leave you with a length of exposed wire at the end of each section keep the ends of all the wires separated throughout this process bend the exposed sections away from each other in a y shape before connecting them to anything make sure the metal at the end of each exposed section is twisted to a point for easy insertion determine how the wires are to be connected to the speakers some speakers come with wire sticking out of a hole in the back of the cabinet others have a row of little sockets for you to connect wires to it should match a row of sockets on the back of your amplifier which looks something like this insert the wires into the corresponding sockets it is important to keep things consistent throughout this step on a couple of different levels look for l and r to indicate the left and right speakers be certain you are wiring the speaker on the right side of your rig to the socket labeled r on the back of your amplifier same goes for left and l take advantage of the color coding on the sockets when connecting wires this will help you to make sure the polarity vs charge is consistent throughout your rig it does not matter which end of the wire you use for black or red only that you remain consistent fasten the connected wires into place this is usually done using the colored switches somewhere along the outside of each socket confirm that each wire is leading from red to red and black to black you should do this before giving power to the system it never hurts to be extra sure since wiring inconsistencies can ruin your equipment a fully connected rig looks like this make sure you hide the wires or tape them to the floor this will prevent people from tripping over them and accidentally ripping the wires out of their sockets,Computers-and-Electronics
how to measure speaker size,if you have an old speaker and you want to replace it getting one that s the same size is important to ensure it fits unfortunately there are no standard measurements for speakers so the listed dimensions may vary from what you actually need measure the diameter and height of your speakers so you can look for new ones that match the dimensions if you only have the mounting holes to go off of measure them thoroughly so you can get speakers that fit in the space,remove the speaker from its housing take off any covers in front of the speaker by either popping them out of place or unscrewing them locate the mounting screws on the front side of the speaker and unscrew them using your screwdriver once the screws are loose pull the speaker carefully out of the housing and disconnect any speaker wires attached to it 1 x research source make sure your speaker is disconnected from power before you start taking your speaker apart check the diameter at the widest point of the speaker s mounting frame use a ruler or a tape measure to take your measurements in inches for the speaker set your speaker upright so the widest part of the cone is face up take your measurement at the widest point of the speaker from one edge of the mounting frame to the other write down the measurement so you don t forget it later on 2 x research source if you have a speaker that isn t round measure the widest points of each side so know all of the dimension take the measurement for the cutout diameter flip the speaker upside down so the widest part of the cone is face down the cutout diameter is the widest part of the cone attached to the back of the mounting frame use your tape measure or ruler to find the diameter at the widest point and write it down so you don t forget 3 x research source if your speaker isn t round measure the widest point from each side so know each dimension the cutout diameter needs to be smaller or the same size as the hole where you plan on installing the speaker measure the height from the back of the speaker to the mounting frame set your speaker so the wide part of the cone is face up again start your measurement from the bottom of the speaker up to the flat piece of plastic or metal around the cone also known as the mounting frame write down the measurement you took so you don t forget it 4 x research source if you have a speaker that s too tall for the area where you re putting it then it won t sit flush or it may get damaged when you try to insert it determine the height of the speaker that extends from the mounting frame keep the speaker face up with the widest part pointing up start your measurement from the bottom of the mounting plate and find the height between it and the highest point of the speaker look at the speaker from the side so you can determine how far it extends up from mounting frame 5 x research source the height that extends out from the mounting plate is important since one that extends too far could get damaged and bump into things for example if you have a car speaker that s too tall it could damage the cone if you close your car door find the outer diameter of the mounting hole look for the widest area of the mounting hole and place your ruler across the hole take the measurement in inches from one edge of the hole to the opposite side straight across so you know the maximum size you can get for your new speakers write down the measurement so you don t forget it later on 6 x research source the outer diameter should be the same size or slightly larger than the speaker s mounting frame if the mounting hole is a shape other than round check the widest point on all sides measure the inner diameter of the hole if there are recessed areas the area where you re mounting your speaker may have a small recessed lip around the inside of the hole so the mounting frame lays flush place your ruler on one side of the recessed hole and measure straight across to the other side of the hole 7 x research source not all speaker boxes will have a recessed lip find the widest point on each side if you have a speaker hole that isn t round determine the depth of the space where you re placing the speaker stick the ruler inside the mounting hole and push it as far back as it can go when you can t push the ruler any further look at the measurement to determine the maximum depth that you can get for your speaker when you get a new speaker make sure the mounting height is shorter than your measurement 8 x research source if you get a speaker that s too tall for the area where you re mounting it you could damage the speaker or it won t sit flush when you mount it check the screw pattern so you can buy speakers that are the same look at the pattern of the existing speaker hole you have and find the distance from one of the screw holes to the one directly across from it check the distances between the other screws and write them down so you can compare the pattern to any new speakers you purchase 9 x research source you can also trace the pattern of the screws on a sheet of paper so you have a visual comparison while you re shopping for speakers speakers will come with the mounting screws required to secure them in place if you can t find speakers that have the same screw pattern you may have to drill your own holes,Computers-and-Electronics
how to measure speaker wattage,since speakers don t produce power that s an amplifier s job speaker wattage refers to the power limit that a speaker can handle before it breaks or overheats 1 x research source this means that an amplifier s wattage must fall within the acceptable wattage range for a speaker you can multiply voltage by amperage to get wattage so most of the information you need to determine a speaker s wattage range should be printed on the speaker box drum or in the instruction manual you can also perform a load test on an amplifier of an unknown wattage to see if it will work with a certain speaker,check the instruction manual to find the rms a speaker s rms refers to the continuous wattage that a speaker can handle for the ideal audio signal when matching an amplifier to a speaker match the amplifier s wattage to the speaker s rms the rms is always listed in your speaker s instruction manual 2 x research source rms stands for root mean square it is a formula used to determine the efficiency of a current based on the wattage without the manufacturer s recommended wattage range there is no test that you can use to find the rms use the max wattage listed in the manual to find your wattage threshold the maximum wattage refers the highest amount of power that a speaker can handle for a short period of time if this number is exceeded by an amplifier the speaker may break or catch fire this number is usually printed alongside the rms 3 x research source if your speaker s manual includes a peak wattage or peak power this measurement refers to the maximum amount of power that your speaker can receive for 1 2 seconds before shorting or dying think of it as the wattage that will instantly kill your speaker a max wattage can be sustained for a short period of time look on the back of the speaker box if you don t have a manual if you don t have your instruction manual there should be a plate or sticker on your speaker listing the wattage voltage and amperage turn the speaker box around to find this information typically it will list a range of numbers under wattage this is an rms range use this number to choose an appropriate amplifier for your speaker 4 x research source these numbers are often printed directly on the drum of the speaker as well you can also enter your speaker s brand and model into a search engine to find the specifications you need find the voltage and amperage numbers if the wattage isn t mentioned if you only have the speaker s drum or there is no wattage information on the box look for a number that ends in v for voltage jot this number down on a piece of paper then look for a number that ends in a this is the amperage write this number down as well 5 x research source voltage is a measurement of an electrical current s strength amperage refers to the volume of the current in a signal the higher the current the more electricity there is it helps to think of voltage and amperage in terms of a pipe the amperage is the amount of water in a pipe while the voltage is how much pressure there is the pipe think of the wattage as the size of the pipe the higher the wattage is the more voltage and amperage the speaker can handle multiply the amperage and the volts to find the max wattage take the speaker s voltage and multiply it by the amperage to get a rough estimate of the maximum wattage for example if your speaker has 120v and 5a multiply these numbers together to get 600 watts 6 x research source to continue the pipe metaphor multiplying the amount of water the amperage by how hard it is pushed out of the pipe the amperage tells you the minimum size of the pipe needed to handle the water and pressure for the speaker this essentially means that this is the maximum wattage since the pipe shouldn t get any smaller look in the amplifier s instruction manual to find the wattage first a multimeter test is unnecessary if you have the amplifier s instruction manual flip through the first 1 2 pages to find the amplifier s specifications to find the wattage if you don t have this information you ll need to perform a load test by hooking the amplifier up to a speaker and testing the wattage through a sound test if the amplifier s maximum wattage does not exceed your speaker s max wattage they re compatible 7 x research source the wattage information is often printed on the back of the amplifier as well look for a sticker or panel with tiny writing on it the vast majority of amplifiers list the wattage here testing the amplifier s wattage involves playing an extremely loud and obnoxious sound so it s best to avoid performing the test if you can find the information elsewhere turn your multimeter off and plug the probes into the front don t turn on your multimeter insert the red wire that came with your multimeter into the red slot on the front of the device take your black wire and plug it into the black slot next to it for all intents and purposes the red wire is your positive line and the black wire is your negative line 8 x research source insert the multimeter s probes into the speaker s output jacks turn your amplifier off on the back of the amplifier find 2 unused output jacks for the amplifier slide the red multimeter probe into the red jack labelled positive slide the black probe into the black jack labelled negative plug a speaker into the other output slots if there isn t one already plugged in 9 x research source the probe refers to the thin length of metal at the end of each wire these are the pieces that read the voltage set your multimeter to 200 volts ac and turn it on turn the dial on the front of your multimeter to 200 volts ac the ac voltage setting is represented by a v with a wavy line above it the numbers next to this v are the ac voltage settings turn the dial to 200 and turn your multimeter on 11 x research source for a low powered amp set the voltage to anywhere between 10 100 wrap the clamp meter around the speaker wire in the positive jack a clamp meter or current clamp is a digital meter with 2 jaws sticking out of the top it reads the current amperage of any wire running through the opening in the middle of the jaws wrap your clamp meter s jaws around the output wire that is connecting to your speaker s positive terminal 12 x research source just to clarify you are not clamping the wire directly it simply needs to run through the opening in the middle of the jaws do not pinch the wire with your clamp meter if you speaker wire is color coded this positive output wire will be red otherwise look for the wire connecting to the jack labelled positive play a 50 hz test tone through your phone or a cd and turn it up turn the volume on the amplifier speaker or receiver all the way down plug a phone or mp3 player into the headphone jack on the front of your amplifier or speaker search online to find a 50 hertz hz test tone press play on your phone or player to begin playing the test tone turn the test tone up as high as you can tolerate and let it continue playing 13 x research source you cannot perform this test using music because the hertz value and power required to play a song shifts up and down as the sound gets louder and softer the 50 hertz test tones are pretty easy to find they re commonly used for this test specifically this part of the test is pretty loud and uncomfortable don t do this late at night when people may be trying to go to sleep read the screens on your meter to find the amplifier s voltage and amperage with the sound playing check the screen on your multimeter and write the number down then check the number on the clamp meter and write this number down the multimeter s reading is your amplifier s voltage while the clamp meter s reading is the amperage 14 x research source as the test tone is playing your multimeter is registering how much power the amplifier is putting on the current the clamp meter is reading how much current there actually is multiply the voltage by the amperage to find the wattage turn the test tone off shut your amplifier down and remove your multimeter s probes then multiply your voltage and amperage together to find the amplifier s wattage for example if your voltage was at 108v and the amperage was at 24a your amplifier s wattage is 2592 watts 15 x research source if you didn t play the test tone as loud as possible you aren t getting the maximum amperage the real number is likely a little higher but it s not worth damaging your ears to find out compare the amp wattage to your speaker s wattage use the speaker s wattage restrictions and rms to determine if the speaker and amplifier can be hooked up together if the amplifier s wattage exceeds the speaker s wattage don t use them together 16 x research source,Computers-and-Electronics
how to clean speakers,speakers accumulate dust and dirt just like everything else in your home clean a home stereo speaker by removing the front grill and carefully dusting off the speaker s cone then clean the grill with a lint roller or wet wipes to prevent the accumulation of dust and dirt and keep your speakers looking fresh and clean use common household items to clean other types of speakers such as those on small electronic devices like smartphones and laptops,turn off the speaker and disconnect it from any power sources switch the power to off if the speaker has an on off switch unplug any power cords from electrical outlets 1 x research source if your speaker has those red and black cables that connect it to the back of a sound system then press down the levers where they are connected and pull the wires out remove the grill from the front of the speaker if possible many grills simply pry off of the front of the speaker use a thin flat object to gently pry it off and set it aside on a flat surface to clean at the end 2 x research source some grills may be connected with screws in which case you will need to remove them with a screwdriver blow off any loose dust and dirt from the speaker with a can of air hold the can of air completely level so that no chemicals spray out press the trigger to blow dust and dirt off of the front of the speaker and out of any cracks 3 x research source make sure to use a can of air that specifically says it is for cleaning electronics don t hold the can upside down or sideways or chemicals can spray out and get into your speaker wipe away loose dust and dirt with a soft brush if you don t have canned air use a soft bristled paintbrush or makeup brush to dust of the speaker cone and all exposed parts of the speaker be very careful when you brush the cone because they are delicate 4 x research source make sure that if you use a makeup brush it is clean and has not been used for makeup wet a microfiber cloth with water hold a microfiber cloth under clean running water until it is soaked wring it out as much as you can until no more water squeezes out of it 5 x research source if the cloth is dripping then it is too wet wring out all the excess water until it is just barely damp wipe down the entire speaker and cone with the damp microfiber cloth gently wipe all exposed surfaces of the speaker with the damp cloth to remove any remaining dust and dirt wipe down the outsides of the speaker box as well 6 x research source speaker cones can be very delicate so be careful to apply just enough pressure to wipe away any dust and dirt or you might indent the speaker cone dry off any excess water with a dry microfiber cloth wipe over all the areas you cleaned with a dry clean cloth use just enough pressure to wipe up any drops of water 7 x research source make sure to use a microfiber cloth regular fabrics will just leave lint behind on the speaker if you don t have a second microfiber cloth then just let the speaker air dry roll a lint roller over the grill to remove dust and dirt if it is fabric peel off the first layer of the lint roller to expose a fresh adhesive piece roll the lint roller from top to bottom or side to side until you have covered the whole surface area of the grill 8 x research source depending how big the speaker grill is or how dirty it is you may need to use more fresh adhesive layers of the lint roller peel off the dirty adhesive if it seems like it isn t picking up any more dust wipe the grill clean with a wet wipe if it is metal or plastic use a wet wipe designed for wiping up dust or cleaning electronics wipe off all the dirt and dust from the grill and let it air dry 9 x research source you can get wet wipes for cleaning electronics at an electronics shop or special dusting wipes in the cleaning aisle of a supermarket use a soft bristled toothbrush to clean lint and dust out of phone speakers gently brush the speaker on your smartphone with a clean dry toothbrush stroke the brush away from the speaker so that you don t push debris further in 10 x research source don t use water or liquid cleaning products to clean out your smartphone s speaker or you could damage the speaker don t use compressed air because the pressure could be too strong and damage your smartphone use a dry lint free cloth or barely damp cloth to wipe smart speakers clean wipe down the whole smart speaker with a clean microfiber or other lint free cloth dampen the cloth and wring out all excess water then wipe down the speaker again if there is still gunk on the speaker 11 x research source don t use household cleaners compressed air or any kind of spray cleaner to clean smart speakers use cotton swabs and rubbing alcohol to clean gunk off of laptop speakers turn off and disconnect your laptop from power sources including the battery wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol and gently wipe the speakers clean 12 x research source some laptops may require you to unscrew the outer case to expose the speakers,Computers-and-Electronics
how to cut speaker wire,when you buy speaker wire you will have to cut it down to size and expose the metal wires inside the plastic casing before you can work with it you can do this by using a wire stripper then cutting the wire to size with scissors or a knife no matter how you choose to approach this remember to be cautious and careful around sharp objects,unplug and turn off the device the wires are connected to if necessary if you are cutting wire that is already connected to an electronic device or speaker rather than loose wire yet to be connected turn off the device and unplug it from the wall before you start working to prevent electrocuting yourself it s more common for speakers to have wires pre attached than it is for electronic devices but make sure it s turned off completely before working either way measure the distance you want your wire to travel whether you are connecting a speaker to a stereo to an amp or to a tv measure how far you want your wire to travel mark the distance between the electronic item and your speaker on the plastic casing and give yourself a little extra room so the wire isn t completely taut upon connecting it 1 x research source if you plan to move the speaker around a lot give yourself a lot of extra room so you don t have to cut new wire if it ends up further away than before if the speaker will be in the same place for the foreseeable future such as for a home theatre system you don t need to give it much extra room at all to keep the area tidy plan to run the wires along a skirting board or hidden out of sight rather than directly from the speaker to the connecting device you will need a lot more wire for this so measure the path with a ruler and cut that much wire instead of enough to directly connect it cut the wire a little longer than your desired length with wire cutters give yourself at least 1 ft 0 30 m of extra room beyond your marked point slice the wire in two by placing the wire at the very base of your wire cutters to get maximum pressure 2 x research source if you don t have wire cutters sharp scissors will do the trick but you will need to use more pressure this is done to ensure that your wire reaches from the electronic to the speakers you can always cut more wire away but it s a lot harder to extend it you can also use a sharp knife and hammer to cut the wire to size place the wire against a wood cutting board hold the knife blade end down at the point you want to cut then hit the back of the knife with a hammer until it severs the wire it may take a few swings but it s a lot easier than sawing the wires away with a knife measure the wire again and cut it down to size you should have plenty of extra wire at this point so your wire should reach from your electronic to the speaker assess how loose it is then cut a little bit more away at a time until you are satisfied with how taut the wire is when stretched between its two connecting points 3 x research source avoid cutting diagonally as best as you can as this could damage the effectiveness of the wires cut perpendicular to the wire to ensure a straight cut pull apart the positive and negative wires gently your speaker wire will have two sides one positive and one negative go to the end of the wire and pull them apart about 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm down from the tip 4 x research source the plastic casing should be easy to pull apart so don t use scissors or a sharp object to cut it or you could risk accidentally stripping your wire casing in the wrong place some speakers have a red wire and black wire inside a larger plastic casing so instead of looking like two wires stuck together it will look like a solid wire containing two smaller ones pull your positive and negative wires out of this casing at the tip and pull them apart if necessary don t worry about which wire is which when cutting them when wiring a speaker refer to your user manual or the instructions on your wire s packaging to figure out the correct configuration insert one wire into the wire stripper so the plastic casing touches the blade you should see a series of holes on your wire strippers insert the wire into the hole most suited for the size of your wire so it barely touches the blades 5 x research source do not clamp the strippers down all the way instead close them so the blades barely touch the plastic casing if the fit is too tight it could be an indicator that you need to use a larger hole on the wire strippers if the blades cut deeply into the casing it could damage the wires if you don t have wire strippers you can use nail clippers instead insert the tip of the wire head on into the nail clippers and gently press down to make a cut in the plastic cut all the way around and use your finger nail to pull the plastic casing away pull the wire through the wire strippers to remove the casing once you ve found the right size hole for your wire sharply pull the wire backwards through the strippers to remove the casing 6 x research source it may take several attempts but be careful every time not to accidentally sever the metal wires encased within do this for both the positive and negative wire if you do accidentally sever some wires it s not a big deal if it s only 1 or 2 if you cut more than this you may need to start over as you won t be able to make a full connection twist the exposed metal wire once the casing is removed to make it easier to connect to your speaker system it also makes it easier to connect the wire to other wires as loose ends are tougher to tie together than a single twisted piece of wire 7 x research source,Computers-and-Electronics
how to shop for speakers,speakers represent a wide variety of sound producing electronics they range from old fashioned bookshelf speakers to surround sound systems that carry a heavy price tag shopping for the right speakers can feel overwhelming with preparation and testing though you can find reasonably priced speakers that enhance your enjoyment of music movies television and video games,decide how you ll use the speakers the variety of speaker builds suits individual speakers for different tasks for casual music listening a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers surround sound systems are also a high end option 1 x research source subwoofers are additional speakers that add depth to bass which is low tone they re good for movies and music with lower range such as rock and metal 2 x research source for adding general depth to tv and movies a soundbar or soundbase is an option these take up less space require less wiring and can be combined with a subwoofer wireless and wall mounted speakers benefit from portability and offer new sound angles in your room for gaming small specialized speakers usually offer enough sound these are placed on a desktop near the computer and have magnetic shielding 3 x research source consider your room s furnishings different surfaces affect sound quality hard flat surfaces reflect sound and soft or varying surfaces absorb sound sound is also easier to hear in a small room to get a sense of the room stand in the center and clap the less the sound carries the more powerful the speakers you ll need 4 x research source a small room such as a bedroom is fine with bookshelf speakers but a large carpeted and furnished room benefits from bigger speakers determine the space you have available while bookshelf speakers will fit in a small bedroom you wouldn t want to try to fit wide standing speakers in there the sound can overwhelm a small room even if it has lots of absorbent furnishings on the other hand if you want a surround sound system for your television the speakers need space away from the wall and surround you where you ll put the speakers matters speakers inside a cabinet for instance can get muffled but so do speakers in room corners since the sound is distorted by the walls speakers benefit from being three to four feet away from the sound source this helps them project sound into the room try to keep your speakers around ear level at that level the sound will be clearest to you 5 x research source consider your budget it s very easy to fall into a price tag trap you ll see bigger and better looking speakers or a salesperson will refer you to them even though quality isn t completely related to price a cheaper speaker may work better for you than a more expensive one stick to your budget as much as possible once you ve decided on the type of speaker you need go online or shop around in stores to compare prices determine how much you re willing to pay for the kind of speaker that seems right for you find what kind of wiring you need if you intend on hooking the speakers to an old stereo system or receiver you ll use speaker wire on the other hand modern speakers and devices use improved cables or even operate in your home on bluetooth or wi fi 6 x research source speaker wire utilizes two wires that contain a positive or negative charge and end in various connectors some connectors plug into other devices while other connectors have to be clipped onto stereos 7 x research source write down your amplifier s power traditional speakers don t have amplifiers especially small bookshelf speakers if you have an amplifier find the model number search online for your amplifier and note its power and resistance numbers these numbers will be in labeled in watts and ohms 8 x research source always match speakers with amps to avoid damaging your electronics the boxes of the speakers will have similar numbers to the amp or indicate they are compatible with your amp s ohm and watt numbers find the speaker s impedance number impedance measured in ohms signifies how much the speakers resist the power sent by the amplifier search the box or instruction manual for the power numbers compare this to your amplifier if you have one choose speakers that indicate they match your amplifier s ohm level or are compatible with it 9 x research source most amplifiers are compatible with eight ohms if you already know similar speakers work with your amp you ll be safe using these lower impedance speakers require more powerful amps if the speaker impedance is too low the amp can overheat check the speaker s power handling power handling is measured in watts the larger the amount of watts the speaker can handle the greater the sound signal this too should be matched to your amplifier if you have one higher watt speakers often require more powerful amplifiers 10 x research source if your amplifier sends out more watts than your speaker uses you can damage the speaker consider speaker sensitivity the sensitivity is measured in decibels db this indicates how loud the speaker s sound can be the higher the sensitivity the more volume it can deliver in a watt of electricity 80 88 db is considered low and 100 db high 11 x research source a higher sensitivity usually means a more expensive speaker or one that sacrifices quality in other areas that affect sound such as the speaker cone 12 x research source knock on the frame once you ve found speakers don t buy them blind if you can help it first rap your knuckles against the speakers the speaker should feel solid and give you back a solid sound if it sounds hollow now it ll sound hollow when you try using it to play your entertainment at home 13 x research source if you re buying speakers online you can search for reviews or tests of the speakers but to some degree you re shopping blind turn on the speakers check that all the plugs work then listen to the sound stand close enough about ear level to the front of the speakers judge if the internal components give you the sound you desire the tightness of the covering over the speaker as well as the material of the speaker cone change the sound listen for any distortion fuzziness or crackling 14 x research source if the outer enclosure is wide or loose the sound reverberates too much inside the speaker if the enclosure is too tight the speaker rattles and the sound distorts 15 x research source cones are made of varying materials such as aluminum and polypropylene and push out air to make sound turn the settings up to volumes and frequencies you ll use at home in order to judge the speaker s sound range play your music if possible give the sound quality a personal test good test songs are ones you know well that you have available on a cd or other format where the song s quality hasn t been compromised queue up the tracks listen for sound

how to install speakers,good speakers are essential for any audio lover but purchasing a good set of speakers is only the beginning in order to get the best possible sound you ll want to spend some time ensuring that the speakers are installed and configured correctly whether your setting up a home theater a desktop computer or installing new speakers in your car proper installation is the key to quality sound,place the speakers speaker placement is very important for home theater audio quality and speakers should be placed before you start measuring out wire speaker placement is highly dependent on where the primary viewing spot is this is typically your main couch or sofa your speakers will work best when focused on this location below are some tips for placing your various speakers 1 x research source subwoofer the subwoofer s sound is omnidirectional which means it doesn t need to be pointed in a specific direction you can achieve good subwoofer sound from most locations in your living room but try to avoid placing it near a wall or corner it s often easiest to place it near the entertainment center for easy connecting front speakers place the front speakers to each side of the tv typically you will want the front speakers about 3 feet 0 9 m 0 9 m between the side of the tv and the speaker angle each speaker so that it is pointed towards the center of the listening location for optimal audio quality raise the speakers so that they are ear level when sitting center channel soundbar the center channel bridges the gap between the front channels place the center channel either above below or in front of the tv placing the center channel behind the tv will result in muffled sound side speakers these speakers should be placed directly to the sides sides of the listening area pointed at the listener the speakers should be ear level rear speakers place the rear speakers behind the listening area angled towards the center of the couch like the other speakers these should be ear level for the best sound possible place the receiver near the tv the receiver can go underneath your tv in the entertainment center or off to the side as long as it is close enough for cables to easily reach the tv make sure the receiver has room to circulate air on all sides run wire from the speakers to the receiver after all of your speakers are placed and the receiver has been set up you can start running your speaker wire to connect it all make sure to leave some slack on each end so that you have room to move the speakers around and make adjustments for floor mounted speakers you may be able to conceal the speaker wire along the base boards or under the carpet if you do not go by a door opening or fixed cabinet along the wall for ceiling mounted speakers you will have to either drill through the ceiling and fish speaker wires down to the speakers or recess the speakers into the ceiling itself recessing speakers into the ceiling may compromise the attic insulation and will make it difficult to aim the acoustic cone of the speaker connect the speakers to the receiver after you ve laid out your wire you can start hooking everything up some speakers will come with wire already attached while others will require you to connect the wiring yourself if you need to connect the wires yourself you may need a wire stripper to peel back some of the coating hook the speaker wires to the terminals on the back of the speaker box being careful to observe the polarity or of the connections many speaker wires are color coded black being positive and white being negative clear insulated wires have a copper conductor in the positive and a silver colored conductor in the negative you may have to connect bare wire to the back of the receiver as well double check to ensure that you are connecting the right speakers to the right inputs on the receiver connect the tv to the receiver in order to get the sound from your tv to come out of your receiver you will need to connect the tv to the receiver hdmi is usually the easiest way to do this though many setups use optical cables to transfer the sound to the receiver connect other devices to the receiver or tv depending on how you are routing your sound you can connect your other devices such as dvd players blu ray players and cable boxes to either the tv or the receiver see the device s documentation for detailed instructions test and calibrate your speakers now that everything is hooked up it s time to test many receivers and tvs have sound tests that you can perform and some modern receivers have automatic calibration tools experiment with music and movies and adjust the levels for each channel until you find a suitable mix determine the speaker setup you may have a single speaker two satellite speakers a subwoofer and two speakers or a full surround system computer speaker setups are often less involved than a home theater but full surround systems can still have a lot of pieces find the speaker connectors on your computer most computers have speaker jacks on the motherboard connector panel located on the back of the tower if you are using a laptop your only speaker port may be the headphone jack or there may be ports located along the back of the laptop the location will vary depending on the computer so refer to your documentation if you are having difficulty locating the plugs if you are using an older computer you may need to install a sound card in order to connect speakers this usually isn t required for anything built within the last ten years understand the color codes nearly all computer speaker ports are color coded these colors will help you determine which plug goes where most speaker cables will be color coded to match these jacks pink microphone green front speakers or headphones black rear speakers silver side speakers orange center subwoofer place your speakers make sure that you can identify the right and left channel cables if you are setting up a full surround system place your surround speakers to the sides and behind your computer chair angled towards the chair if you are just setting up two speakers placing them to the sides of your monitor angled towards you will result in good sound quality connect the satellites and center channel to the subwoofer if necessary different speaker models will connect to each other in different ways sometimes you will need to connect the satellite speakers to the subwoofer which then plugs into the computer while other times each set of speakers gets plugged into the computer separately plug the speakers into the appropriate jacks match the speaker cable plug colors to the matching colored jacks on your computer you may have to twist the plugs if space is tight test the speakers power on the speakers if necessary and then turn them all the way down using the physical volume control start a song or video on your computer and slowly raise the volume until you can hear at a comfortable level once you ve confirmed that the speakers work find a channel test online this will help you ensure that your speakers are placed correctly determine which speakers your stereo supports speakers draw power and some stereos may not be able to handle too much extra draw refer to your stereo s documentation when installing new speakers especially if you are adding additional speakers or replacing existing speakers with high power replacements 2 x research source make sure the speakers will fit some speakers are designed to fit into existing speaker locations while other will require modifications such as cutting away the panel or installing mounting brackets take all of this into consideration when choosing speakers to install gather your tools the tools you need will vary wildly from car to car the location of the speaker you are installing will also have an impact on the tools you need in general however you will probably need the following 3 x research source a variety of screwdrivers phillips flat head offset and more torx driver drill and bits allen wrenches wire cutter stripper soldering iron crimping tool panel removal tool electrical tape disconnect the battery before working on anything electrical in your car it is always recommended that you disconnect the power locate your battery and find the appropriate socket wrench that fits the lug on the battery terminals disconnect negative black terminal and move the cable gently to the side see this guide for detailed instructions on disconnecting a car battery read the included instructions there are too many different possibilities to be covered effectively in this guide for specific instructions for your speakers refer to the included documentation or look up the manual on the manufacturer s website always defer to the manufacturer s instructions remove the speaker grille these can usually be pried off though there may be screws to remove if you are doing this on the front of the dash under the windshield you may need an offset screwdriver remove the old speaker speakers are usually screwed into the panel so remove all the screws before trying to pull the speaker out take care not to rip out the wiring harness that is usually present the speaker may be glued to the enclosure so you may have to pry it off unclip the speaker from the wiring harness after removing it from the panel you will be plugging your new speaker into this harness if there is no harness you will need to cut the wires cut holes if necessary sometimes the speaker you are inserting will not fit exactly into the existing enclosure if this is the case use your drill to cut out enough space for the speaker make sure to measure the new speaker and mark the enclosure so that you don t cut away too much wire the new speaker most speakers simply clip into the existing wiring harness if you don t have a wiring harness you will need to solder the new speaker to the existing speaker wire make sure that the positive and negative wires are properly connected the positive terminal on the back of the speaker is usually larger than the negative one avoid using electrical tape to hold bare wire together as it will likely warp and lead to a bad connection down the road test the speaker before mounting the speaker reconnect your car battery and then test the speaker make sure that the sound coming out isn t distorted and that the speaker is visibly moving at higher volumes you ll want to ensure that it is properly wired before you finish the mounting process mount the speaker after confirming that the speaker is working properly mount the speaker using any included mounting brackets and screws you may want to use an adhesive to help keep it in place make sure that the speaker is secure so that it doesn t rattle and create excess noise,Computers-and-Electronics

design luckily there are plenty of great ways to hide or camouflage your speakers so that they aren t immediately noticeable you can get a unique set of speakers that is much easier to hide like wireless speakers or a soundbar when it comes to cords there are plenty of solutions too although your best bet is a simple cord concealer keep in mind completely covering your speakers will drastically alter the sound quality so do your best to choose items that are made out of thin materials if you re going to cover them completely,get a tv stand designed to shelve speakers to get them off the floor while most tv stands have a single platform there are plenty of options on the market for tv stands with speaker shelves these shelves allow you to set large freestanding speakers directly next to your tv to maintain sound clarity and quality while the speakers will still be visible they ll blend into the shelves seamlessly and won t stand out nearly as much 1 x research source

speakers are no bigger than a shoebox if you have smaller speakers set them on the ground on either side of your television then place large plants in front of them to obscure them if the speakers are resting on shelves stack books vertically in front of the speakers with the spines facing out these are great ways to hide your speakers without the need for expensive items or major adjustments putting anything in between you and your speakers is going to change the sound however the paper pages in a book and leaves on a plant aren t going to reflect sound very well that makes them ideal blockers since the quality of your sound will remain largely intact this is a great option if your speakers are on the ground and your tv is wall mounted purchase smaller speakers that are easier to

you buy wireless speakers and really care about sound quality expect to spend over 100 on them cheaper wireless speakers tend to be quite poor in terms of sound quality get a soundbar for a more inconspicuous speaker setup soundbars are thin speakers that are more aesthetically pleasing than traditional speakerboxes they can be wall mounted or placed at the base of your tv when it sits on the tv stand while they re not great options for hiding they are much less noticeable than standard speakers and blend quite nicely into a well designed room 6 x research source soundbars have excellent sound quality they aren t as good as standard speakerboxes of the same price but they re the next best thing these are perfect if you re not using a tv stand since the soundbar can be mounted on the

black color wires with the red and black spring clips or binding posts pin connectors pin connectors are solid thin pins at the end of the speaker wire to connect these to spring clips simply press the clip down insert the pin and release the clip to connect them to binding posts unscrew the hexagon shaped collar insert the pin in the hole and screw the collar back on don t screw it too tightly make sure you match the red and black color wires with the red and black clips or pins spade connectors spade connectors have two pronged forks on the end of the speaker wire these cannot be connected to a spring clip to connect them to a binding post unscrew the hexagon shaped collar place the spade connector around the metal post and screw the collar back on be sure to match the red and black wires with the red and black collars banana plugs banana plugs have a thin pin that is wider in the center they can come with a single banana plug on the end of each speaker wire or a set of dual banana plugs on the end of both wires banana plugs cannot be connected to a spring clip to connect then to to a binding post simply plug the banana plug into the hole on the front of the collar if your receiver has spring clips but your speaker wires have a plug that cannot connect to the spring clips you can cut the connector off and carefully strip the rubber wire coating to reveal the bare wire underneath check speaker output to the additional zones while many home theater receivers support two or three additional zones they often do not provide power to the additional zones if your receiver has standard speaker connections for the extra zones spring clips or binding posts you can connect the speakers for the additional zones directly to the receiver if your receiver only has an rca output to the additional zones it likely only provides line level support for the additional zones you will need an amplifier to power the speakers in the additional zones make sure the amplifier you get is able to provide the proper wattage to the speakers connect the speakers in the additional zones if you need an amplifier to power the speakers to the additional zones use the following steps to connect an amplifier make sure the wires are long enough to reach the receiver in the main room in some cases you may need the help of a contractor to install wired speakers in additional rooms place the amplifier in the same room as the zone and plug it in use an rca cable to connect the zone audio output on the receiver to the audio in on the amplifier connect the speakers to the amplifier using the spring clips or binding posts on the amplifier make sure the wires are long enough to reach the receiver in the main room in some cases you may need the help of a contractor to install wired speakers in additional rooms connect a speaker selector switch optional if you are interested in connecting more zones than what your receiver can support the cheapest way to do so is to use a speaker selector switch this allows you to connect additional speakers for as many as 8 additional zones and switch between them using a switch to connect a speaker selector switch use an rca cable to connect the audio out of the receiver or amplifier to the audio in on the speaker selector switch then connect the speakers to the speaker selector switch using spring clips or the binding posts on the speaker selector switch note an external speaker selector switch will allow you to switch between zones but will most likely not allow you to power more than one set of speakers at a time control the zones using your receiver or amplifier most receivers that support multiple zones have a selector switch that allows you to switch between zones sometimes they have a power button to turn each zone on and off if your additional zones are powered by an amplifier you can turn the zone on and off and usually control the volume using the amplifier if your receiver allows you to play different sources in different zones consult your user s manual to learn how to do that determine how many rooms zones you need each room in a multi room sound system is called a zone before you purchase equipment you need to determine how many zones you need determine how many speakers you want for each zone a two speaker stereo setup will produce better quality audio than a single speaker mono setup however a single speaker setup may be adequate for zones that aren t used as frequently likewise if you want to set up a surround sound system for your home theater that will require at least 5 speakers and a sub woofer determine the best speaker setup for each zone determine where you want to place the speakers this can help you determine how you will install the sound system and whether you want to use wired or wireless speakers wired speakers are generally more reliable but are much harder to install some wired speakers such as wall or ceiling mounted speakers may require a contractor to install here are some tips for placing your speakers 6 x research source if possible place them about 3 feet from the walls this helps reduce the sound resonance of the room and reduce boomy bass place the speakers apart from one another and angle them in about 30 degrees inward towards the listening spot unless the speakers are designed not to be angled do not place speakers on the floor unless they are designed as floor standing speakers determine how many sources you need after you determine how many zones you need and where you want to place your speakers you need to determine what you want to use each zone for if you just want to play streaming audio in different rooms you can easily accomplish that using bluetooth speakers sonos or smart speakers and a mobile phone if you want to play a cd player turntable blu ray dvd player or an am fm tuner you may need a more complicated setup with an audio receiver do you want to play the same source in all zones or do you want to have the option to play different sources in different zones this will be important when you purchase an audio receiver make a list of the sources you want to use set a budget multi room sound systems can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a several thousand dollars after you determine what your needs are determine how much you are willing to pay and stick to your budget you may not be able to get everything you want right away there are things you can do to save money shop around check garage sales also check craigslist amazon and ebay for the best prices 7 x research source get the speakers first the speakers are the most important factor in your overall sound quality after you determine your needs and set a budget make the speakers your first priority get the best speakers you can afford if you are purchasing wired speakers the speakers will determine how much power you need from your receiver or amplifier if you are purchasing wireless speakers you have a few different options here are few options for wireless speakers sonos sonos are one of the leading producers of wireless speakers they range in price from 150 per speaker to 800 per speaker you can also purchase them in sets for 2 3 and 4 rooms and you can always add more later on sonos speakers are controlled using a smartphone app that allows you to plays different music in different zones or group all speakers together to play the same audio in different rooms at the same time they also support amazon alexa voice commands bluetooth bluetooth speakers are the least expensive way to set up a multi room audio system bluetooth speakers can cost as little as 20 dollars a speaker up to 400 you can mix and match different brands of bluetooth speakers in different rooms the downside to bluetooth speakers is they can only be connected to devices that support bluetooth such as computers tablets and smartphones if you want to connect a cd player or turntable to a bluetooth speaker you will need a bluetooth adapter typically bluetooth speakers can only be connected to one device at a time the device also needs to be kept near the bluetooth speaker in order to maintain a reliable connection smart speakers smart speakers are set up and controlled using a smartphone app but they can also be controlled using voice commands the most common smart speaker brands are google home amazon dot echo or apple homepod their functionality extends beyond home audio their virtual assistants can answer questions and they can be used to control other smart home devices with your voice the downside is they are a little more expensive than a standard bluetooth speaker and they are brand specific the google home app cannot be used to set up and control amazon devices apple homepod devices do not work with anything other than apple products such as iphone ipad and mac get the receiver next if you opt for a wired speaker setup the next thing you want to get is the receiver make sure the receiver is able to support all the sources and zones you want also make sure it is able to provide enough watts so that your speakers function properly and that it is able to safely provide power to all your speakers if you have equipment that has an hdmi digital or optical output make sure the receiver supports those connections many receivers support multiple zones but not all receivers support the ability to play audio from different sources in different zones if that is something you would like to do make sure the receiver supports that functionality sonos has equipment that can bridge wired audio equipment with your wireless speaker system the sonos connect allows you to connect external devices such as a turntable or cd player to your sonos wireless system and the connect amp allows you to connect external devices as well as a pair of wired speakers sonos also makes turntables specifically designed for their wireless speakers leave room for upgrades if you re not able to afford all the speakers zones or sources you want make sure you are able to upgrade later on if you can only afford speakers for 3 zones but you would eventually like to get speakers for 5 zones get a receiver that can support 5 zones that way you can add those additional zones when you can afford them,Computers-and-Electronics

how to connect speakers to an amp,wiring your speakers and amp can be a huge undertaking especially if you don t have a lot of electrical experience while it s always best to leave complex projects to the pros there are few ways you can connect your speakers to an amp from the comfort of your own home the process may be a bit painstaking but with a few speaker wires terminal connectors and a soldering iron you can hook up your speakers to your amp,install an amp in your vehicle find a large area in the back luggage section of your car that can fit an amp for more compact cars like a sedan find a space behind beneath or between your back passenger seats to fit the device as you set up your amp you ll need 3 leads or long wires to connect the device to your car speakers 1 x research source if you re having trouble installing an amp on your own talk to an audio electrician for assistance you can find the supplies you ll need at an auto parts store connect the rca speaker and remote turn on leads to your amp feed the rca cable along the bottom of the doors then plug it into the back of the amp once you ve done this plug the speaker and remote turn on leads into the back of the amp 3 x research source these wires may be different colors depending on the manufacturer if your stereo is in the front of the car you can run the wires along the floor or near the bottom of the car doors these leads connect your car s stereo receiver to your amp cut out at least 4 sections of speaker wire that can fit in your car visit a hardware store or other shop that sells wiring supplies purchase several lengths of speaker wire as these will connect your car speakers to the newly installed amp speaker wires consist of 2 separate wires which connect to the positive and negative terminals on your amp 4 x research source these 2 small and thin wires are surrounded with black insulation car speakers and amps rely on negative and positive terminals or power sources to produce sound remove 1 cm 0 39 in of wire coating from 1 end of the wires use wire cutters or pliers to remove a small section of outer black insulation then pull off a small segment of plastic coating from the ends of each black and red wire repeat this process on the opposite end of the speaker wire discard the leftover plastic once you ve removed it from the wire and make sure that an even amount of bare wire is exposed on both ends 5 x research source you ll need to remove the outer black insulation as well as the plastic coating on the 2 inner wires the red goes with the positive terminal while the black wire goes with the negative attach heat shrink tubing to the wires visit a hardware store and pick up some heat shrink tubing which essentially looks like a plastic sheath or cover for your wires cut a small 1 in 2 5 cm section of tubing and slide it over the exposed section of the wires which helps make them more secure to secure the tubing to the wire hover a heat gun at least 3 in 7 6 cm away from the surface 6 x research source the base of the heat shrink tubing fits over both wires before splitting and covering each individual wire if you re unsure about how to use heat shrink tubing ask a professional for help don t touch or handle the tip of the heat gun when it s turned on or you could burn yourself solder metal terminals to the end of your speaker wires slide a metal terminal clip onto the end of each exposed wire power up your soldering gun then press the tip of the tool where the clip meets the wire repeat this process to add terminals to all the exposed ends of your speaker wire 7 x research source you ll need to do this at least 8 times so there s a terminal on the end of each exposed wire if you aren t experienced in soldering try practicing with some scrap wire beforehand check online or in a hardware store to see if you can buy wires with the terminals already attached connect 4 speaker wires to right and left inputs on the amp search along the back of the amp for multiple sets of terminals use a screwdriver to loosen the screw attached to each amp terminal then slide the wire connector into place be sure to connect the red wires to the positive terminal and the black wires to the negative terminal once all the wires are in place use a screwdriver to tighten the terminals and speaker wires in place 8 x research source check the back of the amp for plus and minus signs which correspond to the different terminals some speaker systems may be arranged differently depending on the car you have keep track of which speakers the wires correspond to for instance 1 terminal will power the right front speaker while another may power the left attach the other ends of the wire to a standalone speaker remove at least 1 2 in 1 3 cm of insulation from the positive and negative ends of the speaker wire with a pair of pliers or wire cutters thread both sections of wire through the corresponding positive and negative terminals use your hands to bend and twist the exposed wire around the terminals which secures it to the speaker 9 x research source you can also use small strips of electrical tape to help secure the wire to your speakers test your car speakers to make sure everything s connected turn on your car like you normally would and try playing the speakers see if the music or radio sounds any louder with the new amp connection if you can t hear a difference ask a professional to take a second look at your wiring 10 x research source wire your speakers in a series if they re less than 8 ohms check the back of your speakers to see how many ohms or electrical resistance they have note that high quality amps may have a resistance of 4 ohms or so while other speakers may have a different default setting 11 x research source if you re having trouble figuring out your speaker settings check the user manual for help unplug your amp and speakers unplug your amps and speakers so no electricity is running through them since you re working with live wires you don t want to give yourself a nasty shock 12 x research source clip a speaker wire between the inner terminals take the wire terminal on the end of your speaker wire and plug it to the negative terminal on the rightmost speaker once you ve done this attach the opposite end of the wire to the positive terminal on the leftmost speaker many speakers let you clip or plug the wires into the terminal which makes the wiring process easier 13 x research source you can use wires with clips or terminals for this wires with clips can be purchased online while terminal connectors need to be soldered manually connect 2 ends of the harness wire into the 2 remaining terminals purchase a harness wire that splits in 2 wires on 1 end plug the wire clips into the remaining positive and negative terminals to complete the parallel setup 14 x research source this harness wire may look like 2 thin wires twisted together secure ending jack on the harness wire to your amp plug the opposite end of the speaker wire into the matching jack on your amp since you re working with a harness wire you don t need to worry about connecting individual terminals like you did with the speakers 15 x research source double check your amp s user manual if you can t find the jack opt for a parallel wiring system if your speakers are more than 8 ohms look on the back of your speaker to see what the total ohms reading is if your speaker has more than an 8 ohms of electrical load you ll need to try a different setup to power it successfully 16 x research source use a twisted pair of speaker wires to connect the positive terminals together visit a store that sells electronic supplies and pick up a twisted speaker wire this looks like 2 different colored wires twisted together and has 2 exposed wires on each end for the positive and negative terminals clip 1 color wire into the positive terminal on the rightmost speaker then clip the opposite end into the positive terminal on the leftmost speaker 18 x research source if your wire is black and white plug the white end into the positive terminal connect the negative terminals

how to use an active subwoofer,a subwoofer is a speaker that s specially designed to deliver low frequency sounds specifically those in the 20 200 hz range subwoofers along with other speaker components can generally be divided into two main types active and passive whereas passive subwoofers rely on external amplifiers or a v receivers to function active subs incorporate their own components all in one self contained system that s easy to set up and place for full effect,plug your subwoofer into a nearby electrical outlet first things first in order for your subwoofer to be able to deliver those earth shaking low tones you crave it needs to have a steady supply of electricity the power cords on most newer speakers come fitted with standard 2 or 3 prong connectors so you shouldn t have any trouble getting the plug to fit 1 x research source a power strip can come in handy if you already have a lot of other devices hooked up in the area where you want to put your subwoofer keep a little slack in your power cord or consider making use of a separate extension cord you re most likely going to want to move your subwoofer around a little later on in order to get its placement just right 2 x research source use a subwoofer cable to connect your receiver to the lfe input on your sub lfe short for low frequency effects is a special auxiliary audio channel sometimes used to lend a particular bass track a little more oomph double check that the cable is running from the output hub on your receiver or the device responsible for generating the audio to the input hub on your subwoofer this connection will ensure that the speaker is enabled and ready to rock 4 x research source a new speaker should come with its own subwoofer cable if for some reason it yours didn t you can pick one up for around 20 30 at any electronics store or audio equipment supply shop most types of media receivers feature subwoofer output ports specifically for this purpose 5 x research source examples of common av receivers include things like radios stereos dvd blu ray players and gaming consoles most movies and video games are engineered with lfe capability while other forms of entertainment including professionally mastered music rely on several different channels to create a full spectrum of sound a useful way to think of lfe is as a bonus layer of bass rather than its primary source 6 x research source hook your sub up directly to your main speakers if lfe isn t enabled connect the output of your amplifier receiver to the subwoofer first then connect the sub to the speakers it s important to connect to the sub first especially if the sub has a crossover built in 7 x research source a crossover splits the signal so the sub only plays the low frequencies and the speakers only play the higher frequencies use a crossover if your sub has one because this will improve audio quality if you don t hear any bass coming from your subwoofer upon finalizing your installation connect your receiver s left and right line outputs to the indicated input ports on your subwoofer instead to make it compatible with a multi channel setup set the size of your front left and right speakers to small if it has options head to your receiver s settings menu and select speakers under the audio settings submenu there you should see the option to change your recognized speaker size by setting your speaker size to small you ll be routing more low frequency sounds to your subwoofer 8 x research source this is a good trick for optimizing your sound s low range texture even if you re working with large standing speakers 9 x research source if you plan on using your subwoofer with multiple receivers keep in mind that you ll need to adjust the speaker size setting on each of them individually note that not all speakers have this option set your sub s crossover point to 10 hz above the lowest frequency it can produce cleanly put on some music and turn the frequency as low as it can go then raise the frequency until the music sounds clean and not distorted raise the crossover point 10 hz above this level for optimum sound 10 x research source in the majority of cases a new subwoofer will come pre set to a crossover point that s optimized for the speaker s size unless you re specifically asked to configure this setting avoid messing with it the term crossover point describes the frequency at which lower pitched sounds are split from the front left and right speakers to the subwoofer which is better built to handle them 11 x research source adjust the phase to whichever setting offers superior clarity and depth look for the phase switch somewhere on the back or side of your speaker or a dial on the digital interface the phase range is between 0 and 180 to determine what setting you should go with put on some media with plenty of bass and flip back and forth between the two settings or rotate the dial a few times before settling on what sounds best 12 x research source the quality of the sound as influenced by the phase depends partly on where the speaker is located in the room so let your ears guide you and don t worry too much about making the right choice turn the volume up to your preferred level most large and midsized subwoofers have their own onboard volume controls which allows you to decide how much bass you want to hear in a particular audio track simply turn the corresponding knob to the right to increase the volume or to the left to decrease it 13 x research source you may need to tweak the volume on a movie to movie or game to game basis since different soundtracks are mastered with different levels keep smaller subwoofers within 3 4 ft 0 91 1 22 m of your main speakers if space permits place your sub or subs somewhere in the immediate vicinity of your front facing left and right speakers grouping your individual speakers in this way will help to ensure that you re treated to one cohesive wave of sound rather than a disjointed mess 14 x research source if you get your audio from a soundbar try to find a home for your subwoofer on either side of it to keep both components close together if you situate your front speakers and subwoofer too far apart it may sound as if the bass is coming from somewhere else entirely this can make for a somewhat chaotic listening experience placement isn t as important for larger subs just don t put them in a cabinet or other area where they re totally enclosed place your sub about a third of the way into the room from the outer walls when it comes to figuring out where to put subwoofers and other audio equipment it can be helpful to follow the rule of thirds that is stow your speaker in the sweet spot that lies roughly a third of the way between the center of the room and its outer walls this zone will generally offer the best balance between acoustics and practicality 15 x research source positioning a speaker right next to a wall invites irritating vibration or distortion but installing one smack dab in the center of the room has a tendency to result in a dull unfocused sound avoid placing a sub in a corner as this could distort the sound put the sub where you sit and move around the room to find the best placement stick your sub on your couch or another area where you ll be spending time listening to music or movies turn on your sound system and crank the volume then get down on your hands and knees and slowly make your way to different parts of the room noting any alterations to the character of the sound as you go when you find a position you like move your sub as close to that spot as possible without interfering with the room s layout 16 x research source it will be much easier for you to simply take a few steps here and there than it will be to keep moving your subwoofer over and over again crawling for bass can be a useful solution if you ve already tried out a few different placements and none of them have stood out to you 17 x research source perch your subwoofer on a sound dampening platform to minimize vibration these nifty accessories do exactly what their name suggests absorb environmental sound that might otherwise threaten to disrupt your enjoyment of whatever you re listening to if you ve got hard flooring in the room you ve designated for your home entertainment setup having some type of base for your bass is a must 18 x research source a decent speaker platform will typically cost you somewhere between 50 80 you ll find these accessories at the same shop where you bought your subwoofer if you don t want to shell out for a proper platform you can try improvising one by setting your subwoofer on a throw rug a folded towel or a small stack of newspapers you could also try rigging up your own elevated platform using items like a low end table or wooden frame and an anti vibration foam pad cut to size 19 x research source find a good place to put your sub unit most mobile audio enthusiasts prefer to tuck their subwoofers away in the trunk or rear compartment where they typically have plenty of room to sit comfortably if your trunk or hatch is a no go however you could also stash your unit somewhere inside the cab like under the front passenger side seat between the back seats or inside the back shelf just below the rear windshield 20 x research source active subwoofers generate a lot of heat while in use so make it a point to choose a spot that will offer adequate ventilation never cover your unit with blankets clothing or any other flammable materials 21 x research source disconnect the negative terminal of your vehicle s battery to power turn off your vehicle completely and remove your keys from the ignition then pop the hood and use an appropriately sized wrench to loosen the bolt locking the battery s negative terminal head in place lift the terminal off of its post and pull it safely to one side 22 x research source the negative terminal will be the one marked with the symbol automobile battery terminals are almost always secured with 10mm bolts which can be good to know if you re having trouble selecting the right wrench 23 x research source this step is crucial for ensuring that there s no electric current being directed to any part of your vehicle while you re figuring out the wiring for your subwoofer connect your subwoofer to your vehicle s battery and stereo system first run the main power cable from the battery to the unit s fuse holder splice the turn on wire and signal cable into your stereo s internal wiring harness and route them through the cabin of your vehicle in such a way that they remain hidden and protected from damage then fasten the unit s ground wire to a suitable spot on your vehicle s chassis to guarantee a safe stable connection 24 x research source hooking up a subwoofer is a somewhat complicated project one that requires a fair amount of technical expertise unless you re sure you know what you re doing it s strongly recommended that you hire a qualified audio expert to make sure that job gets done right and avoid making any costly mistakes 25 x research source don t forget to reconnect the negative terminal of your vehicle s battery when you re done putting in your new subwoofer adjust your sub s settings to the levels that sound best in your vehicle settings like gain frequency crossover and bass boost play a role in determining the overall character of the sound emitted by your subwoofer generally speaking you want your bass to be focused enough to clearly hear those bumping booming low tones but not so loud that it opens the door for irritating audio defects like rattling buzzing or distortion 26 x research source turn the built in amp s gains all the way down before giving your sub a test run that way you can tweak them all individually as you listen until you achieve the precise sound you re looking for 27 x research

how to use a graphic equalizer,a graphic equalizer more commonly known as an eq is used to change the frequency response of selected sounds such as particular instruments or vocals in an audio track it can be used to enhance the bass reduce the treble highlight a saxophone or just make your audio sound better overall once you get a handle on the basic operation of your eq model you can use it to make simple audio adjustments then get into more detailed audio fine tuning,identify the frequency range and control points for your eq most eqs cover the range of sound wave frequencies that are detectable by the human ear 20 hertz hz on the low end to 20 kilohertz khz on the high end your eq will most likely have 20 hz marked on its left side and 20 khz marked on the right 1 x research source between the end points an analog eq will have a series of vertically oriented up and down adjustment sliders a digital eq will have a series of marked points spaced out along the horizontal line these sliders or control points are often set at 30 hz 100 hz 1 khz 10 khz and 20 khz some models allow you to alter these control point settings while others are permanently fixed at these frequencies boost upward to intensify a frequency and cut downward to reduce it with an analog eq pushing a slider upward above the horizontal line turns up sounds within that frequency range this is called boosting sliding downward turns down the sounds in that frequency range known as cutting 2 x research source with a digital eq you typically click on a control point and drag up to boost or down to cut for example if you wanted to boost audio in the 100 hz frequency range you d either push the 100 hz slider upward analog or click and drag it upward digital or to cut the 1 khz frequency range you d slide or click and drag down below the horizontal line check for other features like low high pass filters and q range there are so many different models of eqs both digital and analog that it s difficult to make generalizations on using them rely on your user s manual or contact the device manufacturer or app developer for specific guidance your eq may for instance have features such as 3 x research source a low pass filter and high pass filter a low pass filter lets all frequencies below a certain point pass through and blocks all frequencies above that point a high pass filter does the opposite for example you could use a low pass filter to block all frequencies above 10 khz q range adjustments when you boost or cut a particular frequency it also impacts surrounding frequencies to lesser degrees for instance boosting 100 hz also boosts 75 hz and 125 hz to lesser amounts decreasing the q range reduces this surrounding impact while increasing it enhances it check any eq presets for the type of audio you re listening to many stereos tvs audio players and other devices with digital eq capabilities come with a set of predetermined audio adjustments based on music or audio genre for instance your stereo or music app may have presets for rock jazz classical and so on 4 x research source by selecting a preset the various frequency control points will be boosted or cut to levels that are considered ideal for a particular type of music or audio presets provide a quick way to improve the sound of the audio coming through your headphones earbuds or speakers analog eqs don t usually have presets since you have to manually adjust the sliders yourself trust your own ears when making eq adjustments presets are far from perfect and should be considered starting points so many factors go into making music sound just right with personal preference at the top of the list that you should always consider tinkering with any presets 5 x research source the ultimate goal for eq adjustments is to make the audio sound as perfect as possible to your ears so trust them if your ears tell you that the bass needs boosted adjust the lower frequencies no matter what the presets indicate alter your eq settings when your equipment or conditions change while personal preference is the number one factor in determining ideal audio there are numerous other factors at play as well these include but aren t limited to the quality of your audio equipment the size and shape of the room or space you re in atmospheric conditions and ambient noises 6 x research source for example you may find that adding a new carpet and couch to your den alters how the jazz preset sounds on your home stereo you may have to do some tinkering to get the sound just right once again cut what you don t want instead of boosting what you do want if you want to crank up the bass for your favorite rock album your first instinct will be to boost the lower end for instance 100 hz settings however you usually get better results by cutting the other settings and leaving the 100 hz setting in a neutral position 7 x research source boosting is more likely to add distortions to the audio especially if you boost a particular frequency range to a significant degree cutting is far less likely to cause distortions so to crank up the bass at 100 hz leave it at neutral or only slightly boosted and cut the sub bass at 30 hz and mid range sounds at 1 khz see if a personalized eq app offers a simple solution for you fine tuning your eq settings is the best way to get the best audio for your circumstances in a pinch however you might want to use a smartphone app that learns how you hear and makes adjustments for you 8 x research source these apps usually start by giving you a short hearing test to determine how well you pick up different frequency ranges it will then create custom made presets that will automatically adjust based on the type of audio and other factors if you just want your music to sound pretty good whenever you put in your earbuds this may be the best option for you identify the frequency range of common instruments and vocals once you ve mastered the basics of adjusting the sliders or control points of your eq you can make fine adjustments to highlight particular instruments or vocals with practice you ll know where in the frequency range to look for a particular instrument or vocal but until then rely on charts like the following 9 x research source female vocals 150 hz 1 6 khz male vocals 60 hz 500 hz saxophone 100 hz 700 hz guitar 70 hz 1 1 khz cymbals 200 hz 10 khz kick drum 60 hz 4 khz piano 25 hz 4 5 khz boost the bar in the chosen range to highlight an instrument once you know which frequency range to search in to find a particular instrument or vocals boost the slider or control point that s closest to the center of that range if doing so brings the sound of that instrument vocal to the forefront try boosting the surrounding ranges a little to see if that helps or hinders the process 10 x research source you may have to do some searching by trial and error to find the instrument or vocal you re looking to highlight but keep at it you will find it as an example you might boost the 100 hz setting in search of an electric guitar and find that it helps to boost the 1 khz setting as well prioritize cutting over boosting once you ve highlighted an instrument once you ve found the sound you want to emphasize don t just maintain a significant boost on the range or ranges where you found the sound instead bring those ranges back closer to neutral and cut the ranges that carry other sounds that you don t want to highlight 11 x research source in other words if you want to highlight the electric guitar it s better to cut the drums saxophone and vocals than it is to boost the electric guitar significantly large boosts tend to cause audio distortions which isn t a problem with cuts adjust the q setting if your equalizer has the capability narrowing the q range decreases the frequency range that is being boosted or cut while widening it increases the range this kind of fine tuning can help you pinpoint the exact instrument or vocals that you want to highlight 12 x research source q range is easier to visualize with a digital eq in this format a boosted setting looks like a triangle with the apex representing the amount of the boost and the sloping sides representing the lesser boosting occuring at other surrounding frequencies narrowing the q range makes the triangle skinnier which means fewer surrounding frequencies are impacted increasing q range does the opposite,Computers-and-Electronics
how to clean vintage stereo equipment,buying vintage stereo equipment is a hobby that can quickly turn into an obsessive and overwhelming collection the look feel and tone of vintage audio components have a unique charm and these components often rival much more expensive newer models in their quality unfortunately old and neglected components are often found in pretty rough shape which means you ll need to learn how to clean vintage stereo equipment before use the steps below will walk you through cleaning the interior of any audio component using a basic contact cleaner,purchase a bottle of contact cleaner which is labeled as safe to use on plastics this is extremely important contact cleaner is a spray or liquid product that is designed to dissolve corrosion on metal electronic parts typically the main cause of scratchy and popping sounds while moving volume controls or intermittent rotary or push button switches for speaker selections modes source headphone or microphone jacks etc while all contact cleaners work on metal only parts most will actually destroy plastics and safe lubricants found inside and outside of almost every volume control potentiometer and switch choosing a contact cleaner which will restore and not harm your equipment is always a better choice than using a low cost contact cleaner as replacing your original part once the hidden internal plastics cracked or melted or the metal shaft seized are often impossible and tedious at best so you are better to not attempt to clean with a questionable product and instead live with the unit as it is until you can obtain a suitable contact cleaner which will not harm your precious treasure you can usually purchase a safe bottle at a decent electronics store or over the internet though it is important to be certain shipping of the product is approved by the shipping service as many contact cleaners are flammable and sometimes cannot be shipped certain methods or to certain locations look for a brand that offers quick drying no residue application as you won t be able to wipe many of the internal components dry caig deoxit is a popular brand of contact cleaner and they have d5 specifically for cleaning vintage stereo equipment correctly without harming the plastic components they are an industry leader in contact cleaners for audiophiles and offer product support and product suggestions for specific applications d5 is an industry standard in the broadcast world and safely removes oxidation from the metals while avoiding harm to the internal plastic pieces and lubricants that most audio potentiometers contain avoid using products on your classic stereo equipment that are not intended for use on plastics in your stereo avoid wd 40 a renowned metal contact cleaner not always necessarily safe on all plastic parts as it is not intended for use on most pieces that contain or touch plastic parts or have lubricants required to be able to turn testing before use may not be your option so use the online forums for advice first before trying something not reversible you can save some headaches and heartaches read and understand all labels on your contact cleaner and if you have any doubts don t use it damage cannot be undone equipment damaged or destroyed by contact cleaners which are not safe on plastics can sometimes end up on the internet where you can t try before you buy with no reference to seized or cracked controls so be careful to ask sellers if the knobs still turn or slide freely without excessive force or have shaft or neck breakage hidden by glued knobs etc you can typically buy a few basic models of low cost modern reproduction volume controls over the internet and test different contact cleaners on them to see what works and what doesn t before risking your stereo equipment s rare original pieces unplug your stereo equipment to make sure that no electricity will be flowing through the internal components while you clean unplug the audio equipment do not simply turn the power switch off remove the plug entirely from the wall outlet as death could otherwise occur please note that a qualified technician should be at hand and while many are unable to choose contact cleaners wisely many can help you avoid a shock from a charged capacitor which can at least shock or burn your hand from skin to conductor contact even while the unit say unplugged for a long time be careful and look up electrolytic capacitors for information remove the cover of the stereo component the case of the component is usually removed by loosening a few small screws or bolts often these screws will be located on the sides back and bottom of the unit not all screws on a given surface are for the casing so look carefully at what you are unscrewing so as to only remove the casing screws after removing them set them aside or put them into numbered containers in order to match them up with the correct holes you can put stickers on afterwards taking pictures can help too and gently lift the case away from the chassis spray compressed air throughout the unit s interior if needed if the interior components look particularly dusty you can clear away the dust using a spray can of compressed air do not attempt to wipe dust away using a cloth as a clumsy hand can easily dislodge or damage delicate electronic components or scratch a shiny plastic faceplate spray contact cleaner on parts to be cleaned sparingly contact cleaner can be used to remove corrosion or stubborn dirt from many of the stereo component s internal parts but typically you will want to clean contacts that cause problems beyond looks spray a fine even coat of the contact cleaner on any component that is believed to be problematic due to oxidation applying a thicker coat in areas that display significant corrosion spray jacks plugs any switches or removable connectors that are not soldered and certainly battery contacts if any as these cause the most problems and may even require additional friction to clean or replacement if eaten away by alkaline battery acid the contact cleaner may air dry in a few hours no wiping is typically necessary but avoid spray on things you don t want affected that should not be sprayed such as rubberized belts friction wheels pulleys motor shafts meter displays light bulbs audio or video heads window or dial faces good luck cleaning any of those off if they get a mist on them be certain to not soak high voltage power switches as they may at some point ignite so please don t flood your high voltage power switches with contact cleaners they almost never need to be cleaned and are safer to replace if they would clean the potentiometers with contact cleaner the pots or knobs are the components most likely to display corrosion to clean them find the small hole in the back assembly of the pot or typically larger opening where the pins are soldered to the board spray sparingly an amount of contact cleaner into the hole or into the openings of which there are typically two separate openings for stereo potentiometers and then work the knobs back and forth frequently for about a minute this will spread the contact cleaner throughout the inside of the pot clean the faders and buttons as you did the pots to clean faders and push buttons you ll have to sometimes spray the contact cleaner behind the controls from the front of the unit if access is impossible from the inside without major disassembly after spraying the cleaner push the button or slide the fader back and forth for about a minute any excess cleaner that drips down the faceplate of the unit can be wiped away with a microfiber scratch resistant cloth allow the unit to air out for several hours after applying contact cleaner to any part of your vintage stereo equipment let the unit sit with the case off for a few hours this helps ensure that all the contact cleaner has dried replace the component s case replace the case gently and secure it using the screws or bolts you removed screwed back together first by fingertip then by screwdriver be certain to not force or over tighten as this can strip the threading and certainly crack any plastics easily remember the force required to undue the screws in the first place only after the case is back in place should you plug the audio equipment back in and test it any extra screws should mean rechecking your assembly because every screw is there for a reason otherwise manufacturers would save parts and time if it was not absolutely needed for safety or sturdiness good luck,Computers-and-Electronics
how to connect a computer to a stereo system,follow these simple steps to connect your computer to your stereo system,locate your audio out jack by looking at the back of the computer the out audio jack is usually coloured green plug in the male stereo audio cable put the male prong side of the stereo audio cable into the out audio jack that is located on the back of the computer take the other end of the stereo audio cable and plug the male prong side into the stereo audio female y cable plug one end of the rca cable into the y cable plug in the white male rca with the white female rca and plug the red male rca with the red female rca locate the aux in red and white ports on the back of the stereo the red port stands for right and the white port stands for left plug the other end of the rca cable with the stereo system ports plug in the white male rca with the white female port and plug the red male rca with the red female port choose aux on the stereo itself to receive the sound from the computer on some stereos this is either done by the remote control or manually check for connectivity on your computer this may vary depending on what kind of computer os you have if you re not hearing any sound you may just need to change the audio output,Computers-and-Electronics
how to install a commercial sound system,connecting more than just one or two pairs of 6 to 8 ohm impedance speakers to a traditional a k a home stereo amplifier will likely overload and possibly damage the amplifier a better way is to distribute audio over a 25 70 or 100 volt system instead these are called distributed audio systems these systems are typically used for background music in offices restaurants television audio in pubs etc they are also employed for permanently installed outdoor speakers,decide if you can live without a stereo program or not stereo is a good choice in smaller spaces and rooms that allow the occupants to hear both the left and right program from nearly anywhere in the room when rooms get larger or longer or if the space is one located outdoors deck patio etc it becomes increasingly more difficult for occupants to hear anything other than the closest speaker which will reproduce only either the left or right portion of a stereo program a monophonic audio as opposed to a stereophonic program ensures that every speaker reproduces the combined left and right program and is ideal for these situations do your homework these systems aren t particularly difficult to setup but do require some specific equipment that is not usually sold in stores that sell stereo equipment this wiki should be considered a starting point to help you to at least know which questions to ask while providing some answers at the same time after the stereo or mono question above has been answered the first thing you ll need to know is how far apart the speakers will need to be based on the type and size of the area served and the height above the listening area they will be placed then how much power each should be capable of providing which will help determine the power output rating of the amplifier needed there are charts and websites to help you determine speaker placement that can be found by searching distributed audio speaker placement in your favorite search engine determine the amplifier inputs amplifiers with more than one input separate level controls and a master volume control also functions as a mixer a mixer combines or mixes 2 or more low level inputs provide amplification and output them on a single monophonic speaker output this means an amplifier should have 2 inputs for each stereo source by mixing the left and right channel of the stereo source device mp3 player streaming audio device cd etc to output on a single monophonic output the full range of the source sound is delivered to the speaker instead of having to choose either the left or right channel of the source device directly connecting a source audio device s left and right channel together and inputting the resultant signal into an amplifier s input can damage the source audio device a two input amplifier should be used for one stereo audio source device a four input amplifier would be fine for two stereo audio source devices a six input amplifier would be fine for three stereo audio source devices and so on of course a mono source device would require only one amplifier input the amplifier s level controls help match the input signal levels these may consist of a simple knob an adjustment made by turning a small screwdriver or by positioning a switch between high medium and low if you had an mp3 device on input 1 and 2 a streaming internet audio source on input 3 and 4 and a cd player on 5 and 6 you might have mp3 inputs 1 2 set to low or 3 internet audio inputs 3 and 4 set high or 8 or 9 and cd inputs 5 and 6 set to a middle point or 4 or 5 this would help the speakers play each input at nearly the same volumes without having to make changes to the master volume control every time a different source was selected make sure the amplifiers provide an audio output on a voltage of either one or more of the following 25 70 or 100 volts not as an output to match a 4 to 8 ohm speaker input impedance offered by traditional receiver amplifiers used at home the drawback to these voltage based systems are the inefficiencies or insertion loss of the audio transformer s that are required at each speaker the insertion loss of the audio transformer results in systems that are only about 60 efficient thirty to 40 of the audio power is lost as heat and magnetism into free air in the transformer instead creating magnetism in speaker s voice coil which results in movement and making a sound what does that mean if a system had 10 speakers 5 set at 5 watts and 5 set at 2 watts that would be a total of 5x5w 25w 5x2w 10w for a total of 35watts assuming 60 efficiency we would need an amplifier capable of 35 x 1 666 if 60 efficient or 58 watts minimum to power this system a 60w amp will sufficiently power the speakers but will lack the ability to add any additional speakers so it may not be a wise choice here s why a 120w amplifier would be much less costly than purchasing a second 60w amp and all the work to integrate it with the existing 60w amp selecting a 90 or 120 watt amplifier simply extending the speaker wires and add speakers as needed up to the capacity of the amplifier you can calculate it from the amplifier instead 120 watt amplifier driving 60 efficient speakers is calculated as 120w x 60 60 efficient speakers 72 watts ensure the speaker s audio transformer voltage matches at least one of the voltages available on the amplifier output most commercial speakers include a built in audio transformer for the input signal it is not unusual for 2 or more different input voltage selections to be available on the audio transformer the audio transformer specifications will list voltage s and wattage s rating make sure the audio transformers used will 1 provide enough power and 2 have a matching voltage rating as the amplifier selecting a transformer that is rated for 70v and 20w for use on a speaker that is rated for 10w max is a waste of money a 10w transformer often costs less than a 20w equivalent and could result in poor audio quality especially at louder volume levels know that speaker and audio transformer power ratings are often expressed in watts since most of these systems are designed for background music and utilize many speakers you won t need a great deal of power to each one speakers that have multiple power selections will be helpful many are set up to provide 4 or 5 power settings that typically double at each selection ie 25w 5w 1w 2w 5w some speakers have power levels that must be selected by wiring at the time of installation and others have external selector switches that can be changed on the fly as needed others provide for a variable volume control which is not to be confused with a power or wattage rating others have fixed power ratings and cannot be changed without replacing the transformer as you can see there are benefits to speakers that have multiple power selection switches the wattage needed is determined by how far apart how high and the number of speakers are needed to produce the sound at the level desired speakers need to be close enough so the sound level present in a location between them is not significantly less than directly under one overcoming ambient noise will come into play here too power levels outdoors or other open spaces will often need to be substantially higher than similar size spaces indoors as there are fewer if any walls for the sound to bounce off speakers that are not installed close to walls and or floors will lack a low frequency response when compared to those same speakers that are located on or near these surfaces use a wire size large enough to provide the power needed at the furthest speaker while small wires cost less and are easier to install and hide wires that are too small will limit power to the speakers make sure you select wire or cable that is ul or fm accepted and is rated for the space for which it will be installed plenum rated cables have little to no toxic fumes when burned and as such are permitted to be installed in return air plenum others resist drying out in attics wall spaces sunlight soil etc because commercial systems take a 40 hit in power due to insertion loss it would be foolish to incur even more loss due to wires that are sized too small for the distance needed to reach the furthest speaker typical 70v systems can run very nicely on 16 gauge copper wire over great distances calculate the the distance from the amplifier terminals to the last speaker terminals for each run next add up the speaker wattage use the table below to determine the combination of wire size cable distance or speakers for the system ex 10 speakers 5w each equals 50w total a 50w system can have up to 1 400 1 4k feet of 16 cable a system supplied with the smaller 24 gauge wire on the other hand can only be served by no more than 210 feet 64 0 m of cable see the table below speaker wire chart gauge 5 watts 10 watts 15 watts 30 watts 50 watts 100 watts 200 watts 16 10k 7k 4 5k 2 3k 1 4k 700 350 18 9k 4 5k 2 8k 1 4k 830 415 205 20 5 5k 2 7k 1 8k 900 540 270 135 22 3 4k 1 7k 1 1k 550 330 115 60 24 2 1k 1000 700 350 210 105 50 read speaker wire gauge from large to small from top to bottom in the left most column labeled gauge the speaker wattage totals are listed across the top row the result is the maximum distance or length of the circuit in feet for the speaker wire don t settle for tinny sound get the low audio frequencies back in your system many speakers are small in size and are simply incapable of moving the volume of air needed to reproduce even the most subtle low frequency effects or bass like traditional sound systems recovering the bass is done with speakers designed specifically for that purpose an un amplified or passive sub woofer of your choice with the aforementioned properly sized audio transformer connected will work nicely in a system like this a sub woofer is generally physically larger than the other speakers so that they can move enough air needed to reproduce low frequency effects these low frequency sounds radiate in omnidirectional patterns so it is difficult for people to determine the origin of the sound this makes sub woofer placement easy to do in an out of the way place other technologies are employed by companies that give small speakers bigger deeper sounds but often come with a price tag to match the more surfaces a sub woofer has near it the deeper it will sound the deepest sound will come when the sub woofer is in a corner where it will benefit from 3 nearby surfaces such as two walls and the floor if a corner isn t possible 2 surfaces such as a wall and floor would be the next best choice,Computers-and-Electronics
how to eq a room,a lot of debate rages around the best way to equalize or eq a room but all agree that although you can t change the structure of the room you can change the way the speaker system responds to that space when you eq a room the goal is for the speaker system to produce the same signal that s put into it there are many methods to equalize the sound in a room this article discusses the feedback method for equalizing a performance space,place a dynamic microphone with a cardioid pattern at the center of the stage and point it toward where a person would speak or perform ask anyone making noise on the stage to leave so they don t corrupt the eq process set all of the microphone s eq channels on the mixing board to flat bypass the compressor limiters feedback destroyers and other similar processors so you get a clean signal move the microphone and instrument channels in the monitor s to about where they need to be for the performance adjust the main house eq so it s set to the center position turn the mixer s input gain to off and the channel fader to 0db or 10db the fader setting on the main out needs to be at 10 or 0db raise the input gain slowly until you hear a ringing noise from the speaker system turn it down until the sound stops manipulate the channel fader to cause the speaker system to ring at a low nearly steady tone a real time analyzer will show you which frequency is ringing but it isn t the most accurate reading if you have a multimeter with frequency plug it into the headset out and use the pre fade listen pfl output as a signal the better reading you get the more accurate your adjustments when you want to properly eq a room decrease the ringing by 3db on its frequency which should eliminate the ringing sound raise the fader once the ringing stops repeat these steps for each slider until several of the frequencies rise at once or until one of the frequencies hits 12db if you hit the eq s bottom before this happens there s a problem with the room itself or with the system design turn the master monitor volume back to your preferred level for the performance ask someone to stand at the microphone s and instrument s and check them so you can adjust the levels of each individual input,Computers-and-Electronics
how to make a phone ring using your home stereo,whether you need to make a telephone ring for a play or movie want to prank your friends or simply love hearing that iconic brrrrriinnnngggg getting an

note immediately that this process is somewhat involved it is assumed you have some experience with electronics coming into this article with a little common sense everything should be fine,figure out whether you have an analog phone for old analog phones you must set the ringing mechanism into low resistance mode this is done so that less power is needed to ring the phone the ring will still sound exactly the same you can skip this part if you re not using an old analog phone disconnect the phone and turn it upside down locate the two flat head screws on the top and bottom of the phone unscrew the flathead screws place the phone upright and pull off the plastic housing no excessive force should be necessary if you have to use force the screws may still be caught on the housing locate the bells between them directly below the gong you should see a small metal wire being held in place by a small plastic catch gently pull the metal wire out of the catch and lift it over into the vertical

positives and negatives if you do this part incorrectly you may damage your amp set your amp into monaural mode this is generally a switch or button on the front of the amplifier if your amp does not have such a switch you should find a different amplifier to use if the amp doesn t have mono and it s an el cheapo that you feel like taking chances with you can simply channel all output to either the left or right speaker and unhook the unused lead in from the back of the amp use electrical tape to cover the bare lead ins that you won t be using to ensure that they don t touch each other note that this method will only give you half the power as if you used both leads this is probably still enough bring the volume all the way down note that your amp isn t on or plugged in yet plug the phone into the female rj 45 terminal if you power on the amp before connecting the phone it may cause a short circuit plug your computer s audio output into the auxiliary input on your amp you may need a headphone jack to rca cable conversion wire to do this now plug in the amp power it on with the volume down low in mono mode and the correct set of speakers selected keep in mind that most amps have safety mechanisms in place to prevent you from shorting or overloading them if you ve overloaded the amp and it has a safety it will simply shut off some will try to power back on after a few seconds while others will require you to manually switch the power off and on while it can t be guaranteed that your particular amp has this safety most amplifiers manufactured after the mid 80s are safe always err on the side of caution bring the volume up ever so slightly make sure input is set to whichever auxiliary your computer is hooked into find a song or video to use as test material make sure your computer s volume is all the way up not your amplifier pick up the phone s receiver hold it to your ear like you re taking a call play back the source material if you can hear your source through the phone s speaker then congratulations you have successfully hooked everything up using your phone as a speaker set can be quite useful in its own right but the best part is coming up next hang up the phone from the previous test find a clean 20hz tone to use as source youtube is an excellent place to look but you can also download a tone generator for more advanced applications be sure no other sound is playing play the 20hz tone nothing should be happening yet slowly bring the volume up on your amplifier while the tone is playing once sufficient volume is reached the phone should start to ring don t bring the volume up more than you need to congratulations you did it play the tone for 4 seconds on 2 seconds off to get that characteristic old timey ring have fun using this for good or evil purposes just be sure to bring the volume back down and disconnect everything when you re finished understand what s going on here s an abbreviated explanation why should a loud 20hz tone make your phone ring when phones were standardized in the us back around the turn of the 20th century it was decided that a 20hz ac current would be used to activate the ringer of the phone phones were early adopters of ac current because it traveled over longer distances than dc and the sine wave nature of the current could easily be used to move the gong s solenoid unfortunately it is hard to produce a 20hz ac current without special equipment when you play a 20hz tone what you are actually doing is approximating 20hz ac current the higher the volume is set the more power is sent to the phone with a powerful enough amplifier we can ring the bell even at full volume most unmodified older phones won t ring with the output of a consumer grade amplifier which is why we set the gong into low resistance mode your phone has this setting because of rural houses far away from the central telephone offices lucky thing for us,Computers-and-Electronics
how to improve the sound of your stereo system for less than 100,wringing the best sound quality out of your stereo system doesn t always involve spending money while expensive quality components can dramatically improve your system s sound positioning these components improperly or using low quality wire to connect them can quickly deteriorate your audio quality you can improve the sound of your stereo system for less than 100 by understanding how to implement a few cheap tweaks to your setup,keep all of your source material clean dirt or oil on your cds or vinyl lps will keep them from sounding their best cleaning them regularly costs very little and can make a tremendous difference in the sound quality of your system vinyl can be cleaned with either mild soap and water or a mixture of alcohol and water cds are best cleaned using a commercial cd cleaning spray and a lint free cloth minimize the vibrations incurred by each component the most important step you can take is to make sure that your speakers are not resting on the same surface as your source component your cd player or turntable the speakers will vibrate the surface when you play music and those vibrations will impair the source component s ability to read the cd or lp speakers are best placed on separate stands minimize the electrical interference between each component each piece of your stereo system will create a small electrical field which can interfere with the operation of other components to remedy this place each component a minimum of 1 foot 0 30 m 30 cm away from other components in particular the transformer in your amplifier or receiver will create a fairly strong field so isolate it as much as possible never stack components on top of one another upgrade your stereo system s wiring a mistake many people make is buying expensive components and wiring them together with the cheapest cable available a cheap cable will not be able to reproduce the fine audio detail generated from a quality component to remedy this problem buy higher quality cables to re wire your stereo system like hdmi or cat 5 this is a relatively cheap fix in relation to the overall cost of a sound system improve the acoustics of your room even a very high quality stereo system will sound awful in a room with poor acoustic properties a common problem that you can easily eliminate is sound reflecting off of hard surfaces these reflected sound waves obscure the clarity of the original audio to fix this problem increase the amount of soft material in your room curtains and rugs work wonders for increasing sound absorption for example separate all your cables as much as possible if you have many components in your stereo system an inevitable mess of cables may result unfortunately the signals carried by these cables can interfere with 1 another causing humming and buzzing sounds over your audio make sure that cables cross as little as possible and when they do cross cross them at right angles,Computers-and-Electronics
how to determine the quality of a stereo,when you re in the market for a new stereo for your car or home theater setup not just any one will do knowing a little bit about the various properties of most sound systems and how they affect audio quality will help you find a stereo that suits your needs but won t cost you an arm and a leg there are a few important considerations to keep in mind such as the stereo s basic technical specifications the number of available inputs for other types of media and simply whether or not it sounds good to you,look for stereos with full dynamic range range essentially refers to how many types of sounds a stereo receiver can produce systems with a full range between 20 20 000 hz will sound much more crisp and detailed than those with restricted ranges this is one of the most important factors in determining overall quality 1 x research source you can usually find a stereo s audio specifications on the packaging or somewhere on the unit itself avoid stereo systems that overemphasize a specific range too much high end sounds with a higher pitch can be harsh and piercing while a boosted bass may come through murky or muffled note the wattage the stereo s wattage or power translates to the number of decibels it can produce this is worth thinking about about as audio that sounds great at a medium level may begin to degrade at particularly high or low volumes low wattage systems therefore won t be the best choice for listening parties or other situations where you want the audio to be nice and loud 2 x research source most basic stereo systems have a wattage somewhere between 150 200 watts per channel musicians djs and other who need more power will want to look for a system closer to the 300 500 watt range 3 x research source higher wattage doesn t always mean higher quality manufacturers often make their products louder in an effort to fool consumers into thinking that they perform better 4 x research source identify the total harmonic distortion thd see if you can locate the stereo s thd rating among its technical details this number describes how close the quality of the audio put out by the speakers will be to its original source power is one thing but if there s too big a difference between the receiver and the speakers your listening experience will suffer 5 x research source a lower rating indicates a truer sound any distortion below about 1 percent will be practically unnoticeable but it will become more obvious the higher the number gets 6 x research source you may also be able to dig up a product s thd rating with an internet search if it isn t displayed on the unit itself choose the right equipment for the audio source the source of the audio itself also plays a big part in how it will sound over a new system will you be using your stereo to stream music in high definition or watch youtube videos you won t be able to get an accurate reading of your system s potential if you re listening to underwhelming sources 7 x research source a digital file with 320kbps quality for instance will sound crystal clear whereas a grainy low quality recording will be hard to listen to no matter what it s played on most stereo systems are optimized for a particular source such as digital or cd this can make it easier to find a product you ll be satisfied with if you re not that knowledgeable about audio equipment listen for defects test your stereo with different sources and at different volume levels be sure to pay attention to any buzzing static or distortion you might hear flaws like these are often signs that a sound system isn t doing the audio justice 8 x research source if possible try playing the same source through different stereo systems or the same stereo through multiple sets of speakers so you ll have a better basis for comparison 9 x research source when shopping for a new stereo ask if you can give each model a test listen in store before you make a decision to buy it take price into consideration as a rule a superior stereo system will cost you more than a mediocre one those who aren t keen on the idea of shelling out thousands of dollars for a top of the line model however should consider settling on a slightly less powerful system that will save them money while still performing to a high standard you can expect to pay at least a couple hundred dollars for a worthwhile stereo 10 x research source if you re on a budget go with a basic receiver with a decent wattage wider dynamic range and all the extra device inputs you need to enjoy your favorite music and movies 11 x research source don t be fooled by size rather than being wowed by the way a sound system looks focus on its technical capabilities size and quality have very little to do with one another and too many consumers make the mistake of assuming that the larger a stereo is the more impressive it will sound remember bigger doesn t always mean better 12 x research source it s the hardware inside that matters not sleek construction or fancy packaging go with what sounds good if you re having trouble keeping up with all the technical details set them aside and trust your intuition at the end of the day your own ears are the best judge for whether or not a stereo system is up to par some audio characteristics like the balance between high and low frequencies are simply a matter of personal preference,Computers-and-Electronics

you purchase does not have to be the most expensive it does help with editing if you use a proper microphone you can purchase great professional sounding microphones for under a hundred dollars for editing software there are some free options available if you have an apple product garageband is free to download and is usually already pre installed on macbooks if not there are other free programs such as audacity headphones are very important when it comes to editing again these do not have to be the most expensive or tech savvy headphones when choosing headphones over the ear headphones create a safer experience especially when the editing process is a bit longer to reduce popping sounds recorded by the microphone a pop filter is a very inexpensive solution this can make the audio sound crisp sign up for free services such as audiobook creation exchange acx acx is audible s audiobook site for narrators authors and producers it is easy to sign up you can use your amazon account information since audible is an amazon company acx creates communication between authors and narrators the site is easy to use note that the rest of the instructions in this article are based around the acx interface other services may have similar steps with several differences set preferences and abilities while setting up an account this is important because if you speak and read in multiple languages acx will provide more options based on the languages you speak the preferences also provide options based on characters gender nationality etc you can also set preferences for which types or genre of books you like to read if you are interested in the book the more enjoyable the audiobook will be to listeners this will help you narrow down your search when looking for books ready for narration browse genres topics and audition for titles that you are interested in this process can take a while when you find something that you are interested in narrating you must submit an audition to the author the author will provide a short sampling of the book the sample can be a few lines to a few pages this is just like auditioning as an actor for a television show or film if there are multiple characters or emotions involved in the sample it is important that you adequately express them submit another recording after your audition is approved once your audition is approved by the author acx and the author will require you to submit another recording the material for the recording will be the first fifteen minutes of the book this gives the author the chance to decide whether the fit is right for the book in other words the author may give you some tips about the characters or ask you to keep certain ideas in mind when recording the rest of the chapters it is important that you take the author s notes into consideration with each recording receive the full version of the book once the author has reviewed and approved the first fifteen minutes of your narration they will provide you with the full version of the book they will also give you a date in which the full recording of the audiobook is due they typically allow two or three months in between the start date and the due date this is because there will be reviews and re recordings throughout the process chapters will be submitted individually at first and then collectively it is important to read the book ahead and make notes prior to recording each chapter this is important because there should be a variation of voices for the different characters if there is a line in the book that says we ran out of gas she exclaimed you will want to use a voice that implies exclamation when you read through and notate the chapters prior to recording you become more prepared for changes in character and mood narrate chapter by chapter when you begin to narrate the book you will narrate chapter by chapter in other words after you read and record each chapter you will edit and upload each chapter individually editing should be done using professional editing software this will allow the author to listen to each chapter individually and approve the chapters the better the quality the better the experience when editing be sure to have continuity between takes coughing and other noises should not be heard this is the purpose of editing expensive is not a synonym for professional there are many ways to edit these recordings without dropping a lot of money on software unless you find an editing software that you really enjoy working with it is important that you listen to your own work it is better to catch mistakes yourself than to have the author catch them try closing your eyes while listening to edits it helps with focusing on the sound of the audio clip rather than visuals on the computer screen receive feedback from the author once a chapter is uploaded the author will listen to the recording and provide or suggest any tips or changes to the recording if the author suggests changes to the recording it is best that you go back and make those changes to that recording before recording and editing the next chapter if they make suggestions to the portrayal of a character the same tips and changes may be crucial to the following chapters they may even ask for you to add sound effects that are central to the storyline it is important to take into account any changes that they suggest because they are the judge of the final product submit the full work to the author again once you have finished recording each chapter of the book you will submit the full work to the author again the website will allow the author to listen to each chapter with continuity this is an important process because the author is the first listener of your full recording it is important that you allow the author time to review this material their review will be hypercritical because they want their book presented properly the author will still have suggestions or requests after you have submitted the first draft of the full work receive additional feedback from the author once again the author will provide you with tips and changes to the recordings or edit in rare cases they will only have a few suggestions or requests for change it is important to follow their notes suggestions or requests for each recording this process may take several days the author will most likely listen to the recordings multiple times to ensure that the recordings are to their liking or to ensure that they are held to a certain quality their opinion is the most important to the success of your audiobook wait for an internal representative to review your work if the author approves your work it will be sent to audible for an internal representative to review the internal representative for acx will listen to the audiobook to ensure that it meets audible s standards the standards include being consistent in sound and quality including credits in the beginning and end of the audiobook a sample of 1 5 minutes for retail use etc the full list can be viewed at acx com find out when the book will be uploaded if the audiobook is approved by the internal representative the representative will contact you with the date the audiobook will be uploaded onto the audible platform this isn t the end of your process it is important that you market yourself and your new piece of work on all social media platforms the more you post about your work the more people will listen this is important because most audiobook jobs are paid based on how many recordings are sold paid on percentage also the more you market your work the more reviews and opportunities will present themselves,Computers-and-Electronics

how to reduce static noise in a microphone,there s nothing more frustrating than setting a microphone up for an event or recording session only to find out that there s some strange white noise crackling through the speakers there a handful of reasons that a microphone will emit static sounds the most common problem is that the gain which is basically the mic s sensitivity is set too high on your amp or audio interface however ambient sound bad cable connections and moving air are also common culprits removing static is fairly easy so long as your equipment isn t faulty and you can always edit static out after you finish recording if you re on a tight schedule,lower the gain on your amp audio interface or mic to remove static in the vast majority of cases the gain setting is to blame for static noise find the gain or input knob on your amplifier interface or mic turn it down 1 2 db decibels and talk into the mic again to see if it helps keep adjusting the sound until you find a level where the static noise is completely gone 1 x research source gain is basically how sensitive your microphone is the higher the gain the louder the output volume of the microphone will be if the gain is too high the microphone will pick up background noise and amplify it into static there is no correct or universal setting when it comes to gain it all depends on the power of the microphone the microphone s diaphragm and the settings on your amplifier or interface an audio interface refers to any device that converts audio to a digital signal if you record music at home the audio interface is that box that your mic s xlr cable plugs into push your headphone and mic cables in all the way to secure them static is often caused by a jack or cable not sitting correctly in its port give the cables connecting your mic headphones computer amp or interface a quick push to make sure they re plugged in all the way if one the cables is jiggling a little it may need to be replaced to remove the static 2 x research source if the static is in your headphones but it s not present when you speak into the mic or record audio the headphone jack is faulty just get new headphones and the static will go away position the microphone at least 10 ft 3 0 m away from speakers amps or devices if you re speaking into a mic and sending the audio out of an amplifier or speaker at the same time changing where you stand will remove the feedback occasionally the low or high frequency sounds from other electronics can trigger audio static if there is a phone tv or other audio equipment near the microphone move it 3 x research source feedback is a result of the ambient noise being projected into the air and cycling back through the microphone this happens over and over again until the resulting sound is the high pitched feedback that sounds like fingernails on the blackboard hold the mic 1 3 inches 2 5 7 6 cm from your mouth when you talk the more space between your mic and your mouth the more likely the mic is to pick up distorted sound in the air move the microphone closer to your lips to see if the static dissipates 4 x research source if the audio is too loud when you move the mic closer to your mouth turn the gain down try different electrical outlets or usb ports to remove interference this is an uncommon solution but it s worth exploring before moving on turn your mic speaker amp or audio interface off then unplug every cord you ve got plugged into a wall or usb port and put them into new outlets since some outlets and ports produce different currents this may get rid of the static 5 x research source just to clarify if this works it isn t because your wall outlets or usb ports are bad it just means the electrical current clashed with something in your microphone or audio device soundproof your room if you record audio indoors if you re running into static and you record at home soundproof the room either put soundproofing foam all over the walls or insulate the walls and floor with tapestries and carpets you can also use soundproofing boards or hang curtains along the walls to reduce the sound in the room 6 x research source this will reduce the overall ambient sound in the room which may cut down on the static you re experiencing turn off any fans or ac units while recording to cut out excess noise fans air conditioning units and heating vents pump air around your home and this movement of air may trigger static sounds the sound they make may also be picked up by the mic just shut your air conditioning heat or fans off when you re recording 7 x research source don t run your washer dryer or dishwasher while you record keep noises in other rooms to a minimum a sensitive microphone may pick up small sounds from other rooms even if you don t notice them yourself put a pop filter on your microphone to remove static from your voice a pop filter refers to a small screen that covers your microphone to remove popping and hissing noises from p h and t sounds buy a pop filter and attach it to the mic stand just below your microphone then adjust the flexible part to place the fabric or metal filter in between your mouth and the mic 8 x research source pop filters will remove any static triggered by the words you say into the mic if you record outdoors get a windscreen this is basically a big sock that goes over the microphone to filter out the sound caused by moving air use a daw to edit your audio and remove static manually daw is short for digital audio workspace it refers to any program that edits and records audio you can use the digital effects that come with most daws to edit the static out of your audio either as you record or after you ve finished recording download a daw to edit your recorded audio 9 x research source some popular daws include fl studio sonus ableton reaper and cubase there are a handful of solid free options waveform cakewalk adobe audition 3 and audacity are all free if you have a mac garageband is a free daw that comes with your computer put a noise gate on the audio to cut any quiet soundwaves triggering static a noise gate is an effect that controls and regulates volume in a recording open the effects tab in your daw and select gate play the audio and adjust the threshold dial until the static disappears you can achieve a similar effect by turning the attack down and increasing the time dial 10 x research source some effect panels have a preset called noise suppression if your noise gate has this preset use that instead the gate basically looks at an audio clip and trims any sound that s below your threshold setting since static is normally very subtle it rarely has a loud soundwave the gate will automatically cut anything below the volume you set the threshold at place a hard limiter on the audio if the static is caused by clipping a hard limiter is an effect that puts a cap on audio volume if the static is caused by loud sounds select hard limiter in your effects tab set the threshold to 1 db or more while playing your audio this will lower the volume of loud sounds to reduce any crackling noises triggered by high volumes 11 x research source this will lower the volume of the recording you can compensate for the difference by turning up the overall volume of the master recording a hard limiter is basically the opposite of a gate it looks at the peaks of each soundwave and checks to see if passes a certain threshold if the static is caused by loud sounds the hard limiter will greatly reduce the sound of the static open the sound settings in your computer s control panel if you hear static whenever you use the built in mic in your webcam or laptop you can usually fix the problem in your computer s settings pull up your computer s control panel and click hardware and sound then select sound to open the audio devices tab 12 x research source select the recording tab and right click your microphone at the top of the audio devices page there are 4 tabs select the second tab labelled recording this will show you a list of every device capable of recording audio on your computer if your mic is on you will see the volume bar and green checkmark next to the device right click your mic 13 x research source click properties and turn the microphone boost off on the pop up menu select properties to pull up the mic s settings check to see if there is an option labelled microphone boost if you have the microphone boost option turn it off or lower the volume on the boost to see if this resolves the problem 14 x research source microphone boost is basically an artificial gain on your computer mic turning this off will typically resolve the static problem slide the microphone s level up and click enhancements next click the levels tab at the top turn the volume slider on the microphone all the way up if there is a button labelled enhancements click it to open the optional settings for your microphone 15 x research source every version of windows does not have the enhancements button if you don t have it don t worry about it your problem should be resolved turn noise suppression and echo cancellation on in the enhancements tab there are a few options for the microphone make sure that both noise suppression and echo cancellation have checkmarks next to them this will filter out any static sounds you experience 16 x research source if you still hear static try updating the drivers for your webcam or microphone if that doesn t work you probably need a new webcam or mic,Computers-and-Electronics
how to make a microphone sound better,whether it s a personal or professional project microphones are an essential tool if you re looking to record audio unfortunately it can be tough to get your recordings to sound crisp and clear if you re using an external microphone try making a few tweaks to the physical placement of your equipment and checking the input settings for those using a smartphone microphone aim to make a few small adjustments it only takes a few minutes to get cleaner more professional sounding audio from your recording equipment,position yourself about 8 in 20 cm away from the microphone don t underestimate the power of your external microphone try and stay a short distance away from your microphone to keep the recording quality balanced and consistent when you sit a careful distance away you prevent your audio from sounding too loud and booming 1 x research source if you have a deeper voice your recordings will naturally have more bass which will make your recorded voice sound more booming and difficult to understand if you re speaking too close to the microphone record in a room without lots of hard surfaces sound bouncing off of bare walls tile floors and other hard surfaces causes echo or reverb instead try to set up a recording space in a room with soft furniture and things on the walls 2 x research source if you have enough room in a closet try setting up your microphone in there where clothing will muffle the echoes set your microphone input level to 75 remember that when it comes to microphones less is more don t keep your microphone s input set to the maximum level instead lower it to around ¾ of the original level 3 x research source if you re looking for a more technical measurement try adjusting your input levels to read 12 db sometimes it s easier to manage your volume and input levels by working in a third party recording app like audacity or adobe audition improve your sound quality by using a pop filter you can use this circular filter to reduce the breathy sounds of hard consonants in your recordings use a clamp to attach it to your microphone stand positioning it about 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm in front of the microphone the price of a pop filter can range from 15 to 40 but it could be a good investment for musicians or podcasters looking to take their recordings to the next level 4 x research source if you angle your microphone to be slightly above or below your mouth or in some way where you re not singing directly into the microphone you won t record as many popping or breathing sounds 5 x research source you can find pop filters online for a reasonable price record in a quiet space with no background noise while smartphones are smaller than external mics you can t fine tune how much or how little noise they pick up to improve the sound of your recordings find a place that has no background noise that could make your audio sound bad like a nearby conversation or a noisy air conditioning vent you can make your audio a lot better by ensuring that your voice is the focal point of each recording as it should be 6 x research source it can be especially useful to record in a place with less furniture or hard surfaces so the sound can t bounce or echo as much 7 x research source stick a small piece of scotch tape over the microphone area on your phone find a small dot or pinprick along the edge of your phone usually on the back of the device take a small 1 inch 2 5 cm or smaller piece of scotch tape and apply it directly over the microphone hole to reduce unwanted background noise if your recordings still sound the same try using a small piece of masking or duct tape if you want try experimenting with several layers of tape if your environment tends to be louder 8 x research source this is a great way to get cleaner recordings from busy events like concerts and large conferences keep your phone on airplane mode to prevent notifications from going off don t let a perfectly good recording go to waste because of an unwanted text notification instead switch your phone to airplane mode so it gets no internet which of course means no texts if you have any further sound issues with your phone microphone you ll be able to cross off phone notifications from the list of possible culprits 9 x research source invest in high quality recording apps for your phone look into applications that automatically cut back on the level of junk and background noise that gets recorded if you re okay with spending a little bit of money there are a variety of apps that you can purchase if you so desire for iphone users look into apps like voice record pro and voice recorder audio editor if you use an android try looking into titanium recorder or recforge ii 10 x research source all of these apps are under 10 and many are also free with advertisements running in the background,Computers-and-Electronics
how to prevent microphone feedback,microphones produce feedback when they re connected to a speaker and capture the noise of the output which can create a high pitched ringing noise while you can t completely prevent microphone feedback there are ways that you can reduce the chances of it happening since echoed sound is the most prominent cause of feedback try to limit how much noise enters the microphone you can also make adjustments on your equalizer so the frequencies aren t as prominent with the right microphones and settings your audio should sound clear,point the microphone away from any speakers it s connected to avoid holding the microphone directly in front of a speaker or monitor since it will immediately start to pick up the frequencies and cause feedback instead keep the output speakers in front of the microphone so it doesn t capture audio if you re holding the microphone be careful not to bring it past the speakers or else it may start ringing 1 x research source try using a directional or cardioid microphone because they only pick up sounds from what they re pointed at avoid using an omnidirectional microphone if you can since it captures audio from every angle and is prone to feedback stay as close to the microphone as you can more interference can enter the microphone if you keep the audio source far away if you re singing or speaking hold the microphone directly in front of your mouth so it only picks up your voice instead of the noise around it if you re hooking a microphone up to an amp or instrument place it as close as possible so it doesn t get a lot of feedback from other sources 2 x research source opt for direct input for instruments if you can so you don t need to hook them up to a microphone first wear headphones or in ear monitors to reduce feedback through speakers if you have vocals running through a stage monitor or speaker you may pick them up with your microphone if you re performing or speaking ask the sound technician if they have in ear monitors which will play the audio from your microphone directly in your ears so you can hear yourself if you re recording vocals listen to the track using headphones so the audio doesn t get picked up by the microphone 3 x research source many recording microphones have a port that you can plug headphones into directly so you can hear your own audio as well turn off or mute the microphone when you aren t using it if you re using the microphone locate the power switch or button when you re finished using it and turn it to the off position so it doesn t pick up any other audio if you re controlling audio or recording multiple microphones at the same time mute the ones that aren t being used on your mixer or computer when someone wants to use them again turn the microphones back on again 4 x research source if there isn t a switch or button on the microphone then you may need to unplug the cable attached to it instead reduce the number of hard surfaces in the room so sound doesn t bounce audio reflects and echoes off of flat surfaces which can re enter the microphone and create feedback start by removing tables and other hard surfaces from the room where you re using the microphone then try to cover as many surfaces as you can with softer materials such as carpeting blankets or thick tablecloths hang acoustic foam around the room to make irregularly shaped surfaces that don t produce an echo 5 x research source avoid pointing speakers at walls ceilings or windows since they ll make sounds bounce even more instead point the speakers toward people or a crowd reduce the microphone s gain setting so it doesn t pick up noises easily the gain determines the microphone s sensitivity to sound and how loudly it picks up noise turn the gain on the microphone up until you can just barely hear feedback coming from it lower the amount of gain by 5 10 decibels db so it s less likely to produce feedback while you re using the microphone 6 x research source you can find the gain control either on the audio mixer or the digital audio workstation you re using some microphones also have a gain control knob on them so you can adjust the microphone before it goes into a sound system lower the volume of the speakers so they re less likely to cause interference speakers that are too loud can cause more audio to bounce around the room and enter the microphone if you hear feedback coming from the microphone reduce the volume on each speaker it s connected to by about 5 db at a time to make small adjustments test the microphone and listen for feedback again turning down the volume more if you need to 7 x research source be careful not to turn the speakers down too much or else you may not be able to hear the audio clearly only turning down the speakers may not completely reduce feedback you may need to use additional methods to completely eliminate it turn down the eq frequencies by 5 db at a time to find what causes feedback set the frequency dials or faders on your equalizer so they re at 0 db increase the leftmost frequency by 5 db and test using your microphone to see if you hear feedback set the frequency back to 0 db before you test the next one continue testing down the line of frequencies and make note of which ones produce the most feedback reduce the volume of the frequencies causing you problems so the feedback doesn t sound as prominent 8 x research source as you get used to how the feedback sounds you may be able to detect which frequencies are causing problems by ear use an automatic feedback eliminator if the microphone isn t in a set position automatic feedback eliminators are items you can connect to the microphone line that sense when there s interference connect the line for the microphone into one of the inputs on the eliminator using the regular cord then run an xlr cord from the output of the feedback eliminator to the equalizer so it s completely connected if the eliminator detects feedback it will turn down the frequencies immediately 10 x research source you can buy automatic feedback eliminators from audio supply stores or online automatic feedback eliminators work best for live performances or presentations put a noise gate filter on recorded audio to help reduce background frequencies a noise gate filter limits which decibel range the microphone picks up and silences anything below the threshold turn on the noise gate filter in your digital audio workstation and set the lower limit about 10 15 db below the input s volume test playing the audio to see if the filter eliminates the ambient feedback if it doesn t try raising the filter up by 2 3 db at a time 11 x research source most digital audio workstations have noise gate plug ins already installed avoid setting the filter too high since it may cut off whatever you ve recorded,Computers-and-Electronics
how to adjust gain on a mic,if you own a digital microphone you may have wondered what that little dial labeled gain is supposed to be for even when you find out that gain determines how loud sound volume is it is often difficult to set properly the gain dial usually isn t numbered so you aren t alone if you have ever struggled to find the proper audio setting factors like where you stand and how loud you speak affect the gain with good recording software you can monitor the microphone s sound level and make adjustments to set the perfect sound levels for the show,plug the mic s usb cord into a device and open the recording software select a spot near where you plan on recording choose a safe spot like a desktop and make sure you have plenty of room to get up close to the mic then plug the mic s usb cord into your computer open the recording software so you re able to get an idea what sounds your mic is detecting 1 x research source try to arrange your equipment the same way you will when using it for a performance it can save you some time later but it also helps you adjust the gain more accurately digital mics are very easy to adjust but you should still test them ahead of time to ensure the gain level is correct press the record button and speak into the microphone think about how you plan on using the mic once everything has been set up stand in the same spot you plan on being for the official recording speak at the same volume you plan on using for the performance you will end up with a more accurate test this way say or sing a few lines while the mic is on 2 x research source if you re using the mic to pick up sound from an instrument play the instrument to perform the test make sure any other equipment you re using such as amplifiers have been set up you don t need to create a long test recording to adjust the gain just do a short soundcheck such as by reading a few lines or playing part of a song use the sound software on your recorder to play back the test audio press the playback button in the recording program on your computer every program has a decibel db meter you can use to monitor volume listen to the audio quality as well when the meter fills up the recording usually distorts and becomes unpleasant to listen to if the meter stays at a low level the recording most likely will be too soft 3 x research source audio clipping happens when the decibel level increases too high usually above 0 db clipping causes the audio to sound distorted and distorted recordings are almost impossible to fix some recording software has an active meter so you can watch the db level while the microphone is in use check the microphone tab in the recording program turn the dial on your microphone clockwise to increase the gain most usb microphones have control knobs right on them so adjusting the gain takes no time at all locate the dial which will likely be marked gain and have a small white stripe on it raise the gain to increase the volume turn the dial counterclockwise to lower the gain and decrease the overall volume 4 x research source think of the dial as a clock when its white stripe points upward to the 12 o clock position the gain will be pretty much nothing it usually needs to be closer to the 2 o clock position to make a difference in the sound quality gain dials usually aren t labeled with numbers or settings so you will have to adjust it manually through frequent tests set the decibel level on the microphone around 6 to 12 db the decibel level indicates how loud a recording sounds but using the wrong level can make it too soft or too distorted the loudest parts of the recording should be around 6 to 12 watch the decibel meter through your recording software while also listening to the audio quality raise the gain if the recording is too soft or lower it if it has noticeable clipping 5 x research source the proper gain setting can vary a lot depending on the type of recording you re doing if you re just talking into a microphone a high setting like 6 db will be fine if you re playing a loud instrument set it lower to avoid clipping when the gain is at a low db setting you can get louder without getting sound distortion normally you should set the gain so the volume is consistent but leave it a little lower if you expect the sound to get louder at any point for example at a 2 db setting you have to speak at a consistent volume to avoid clipping if it s at 10 db you can get a little louder sometimes such as by speaking louder when you get excited or turning up an instrument s volume record more test audio to make additional adjustments to the gain each time you make an adjustment start a new recording play it back while watching the volume level and listening to the sound quality then make further adjustments to your mic as needed at the right setting you can make a quality recording that is enjoyable to listen to 6 x research source keep testing the audio and making adjustments to it until you re happy with it sometimes finding the right settings takes some time plug the microphone into a mixer or preamp to control the gain analog mics don t have their own gain controls so they have to be plugged into something else to pick up sound the simplest way to do this is by connecting the mic directly into a slot on a mixing board connected to a sound recorder mixing boards often have several different spots to plug in microphones so they are great for recording things like live music they also have separate gain controls for each mic you plug in 7 x research source a preamp picks up the signal from a microphone and pumps it up so it sounds louder it gives you a higher quality recording that you can then edit later if you re using one it will have its own gain control note that some places like many concert venues have sound systems that include mixing boards plug your recorder and microphones in there rotate the control dial to set the gain to 8 to 12 db the dial will be labeled as gain or trim it is well labeled and numbered on most mixers and preamps you usually have to turn it clockwise to set the gain to a negative rating keep the gain relatively low so the sound level isn t too loud 8 x research source if your device doesn t have a labeled gain dial turn it clockwise to about the 2 o clock position then make a recording listen to it and fine tune the setting turn on the sound recorder so you re able to hear the microphone s audio make sure your recorder is plugged into the mixer or preamp if you re using a computer open up the recording software look for a decibel meter tracking the volume level coming from the mic you can use this to figure out the best gain setting 9 x research source speak a few lines into the microphone to create a test recording stand in front of the mic like you will during the recording if you re doing a vocal performance speak or sing at the same volume you plan on using later if you re playing an instrument tune it before playing it make sure any other devices you re using like amplifiers have been hooked up and adjusted to the proper settings as well 10 x research source many mixers and recording software have meters that light up while a mic is in use watch the meter to see what decibel level the audio reaches so you can make adjustments to it change the gain level according to the test audio listen to the sound quality while playing back the recording if you re using recording software watch the sound level meter in it note any spots that sound loud or distorted and turn the gain down a little to compensate go back and make another test recording to ensure that the gain is right where you want it 11 x research source if you re using multiple mics such as to record different instruments during a concert check the gain on each one make sure the audio levels are relatively similar for each one if the recording sounds soft bump up the gain level a little to increase the volume however be careful since the audio can become distorted when the sound gets too loud,Computers-and-Electronics
how to sing into a microphone,the way you hold your microphone can have a large effect on both how you sound and feel on stage singing with a microphone can take a bit of getting used to with a little time spent getting to know how the microphone feels and sounds and practicing with it you ll soon feel comfortable singing into a microphone,practice with objects similar to a microphone even if you don t always have access to a microphone during your solo practice time you will still get the feel for singing with an object in your hand you can use something like a hairbrush or water bottle to simulate the feeling of holding the microphone while you are singing 1 x research source microphones are fairly heavy so use an object with some weight for example if you are using a water bottle for practice use a full water bottle rather than an empty one hold the microphone at a 45 degree angle 2 x research source the rounded head of the microphone will be next to your mouth grasp the microphone firmly with all the fingers of the hand of your choice if you want you can support the microphone with both hands or switch between hands your grip should be firm but not overly tight don t grasp any part of the head of the microphone as this can muffle the sound your hand should be around the middle of the microphone keep your elbow in towards your body 3 x research source this is the elbow of the arm holding the microphone keeping it close helps to anchor your microphone and keep the sound steady however don t hold it so tightly close to you that it restricts your airflow or rib cage expansion while singing use a microphone stand if you aren t comfortable holding a microphone you can ask to use a microphone stand this keeps your arms free and can help ease your nerves in certain settings like a recording studio your microphone will most likely always be on a stand so you won t need to worry about holding it position the microphone close to your mouth 4 x research source vocal microphones are designed for close use however you don t want to touch the microphone with your mouth optimally your mouth should be about one to four inches from the center or axis of the head of the microphone if you are using a stand make sure the stand is raised so that the head of the microphone is at the level of your mouth when you are standing up straight the top of the microphone s head should be directly across from your lower lip 5 x research source you don t want to have to either raise or lower your chin to sing into the microphone keep your head steady because you want your mouth to be pointed towards the center of the microphone your tone can change if you move your head around too much when you move your head during a performance make sure that you move your microphone along with your head alternately try to keep your head held steady above the microphone maintain your posture 6 x research source your posture is an integral part of your sound when you are singing you want to make sure that your microphone placement allows you to keep your good posture in place your back and neck should be comfortably straight you don t want to hunch over your microphone you also don t want to have to lift up your chin to sing into your microphone test your microphone 7 x research source whether you are recording or performing you want to test your microphone before you begin and become familiar with it know how to turn your microphone on it may seem silly but you want to make sure you are comfortable with the basics of the specific microphone you are using as you sound check don t just say a few words sing a portion of your songs trying to test a range of notes and levels you want the sound tech to adjust the microphone to your specific voice and tone rather than you trying to adjust to the microphone make sure you can hear yourself whether you re listening in the speakers or have a headset if you can t hear what you are singing ask the sound tech to adjust your microphone or headset make sure the sound is clear listen for any unwanted feedback this can be an indication the levels need to be adjusted don t over or under compensate in volume you want to sing at your natural level neither too softly or too loudly resist the temptation to adjust your distance from the microphone when you sing at different volumes or pitches the microphone should be adjusted to you you want to sing at a normal volume don t feel like you have to hold back on big crescendos just because you re singing into a microphone when you re going through sound check make sure you are singing at the level you ll be singing during your performance,Computers-and-Electronics

how to set up a pa system,setting up a public address pa system doesn t need to be hard here are some simple steps to get your system set up for a small group setting,be sure to be using suitable equipment if renting the pa system take a look at the components to make sure they are in decent condition while you may not be able to fully test the system quickly you will be able to notice broken speaker stands and things that can be a concern be sure to set the speakers in the right location the speakers should be in front of and never behind the microphones to avoid feedback set the microphone on the podium so it will be at generally the correct height and is securely held run the microphone cable to the pa system and be sure to tape down the cables so that no one trips over them test the system with an assistant speaking into the microphone be wary of any kind of echo or howling sounds as you turn up the volume the characteristics of these sounds can change once the room is full of people be sure to have adequate volume before the event starts and adjust the location of your speakers before the event starts moving the speakers even just a few inches further forward can eliminate the threat of feedback but remember once the event starts it s going to be impossible to do any more testing or move the speakers do it in advance,Computers-and-Electronics
how to tune a pa system,tuning a pa system sounds like a big scary process but it doesn t have to be there are complex scientific methods for doing this that involve unpleasant sounding pink noise and fancy computer software but you can do basically the same thing using just some recorded music a graphic equalizer and your ears this article gets a bit technical you may wish to refer to how to set up a sound board before reading this article if you are not familiar with pa system set up in general note in this article the terms equalizer and eq are used interchangeably,set up your pa system and make sure it is working including your graphic equalizer s make sure that the inputs of your eq are connected to the left right outputs of your mixing desk and the outputs of the equalizer are connected to your main left right power amps make sure that both the graphic eq and the eq on the mixing board are set flat that is neither boosting or attenuating any frequencies connect your playback device and play some music it is best to play a song that a you are familiar with because you need to know what the track is supposed to sound like and b that is similar in style and instrumentation to the music you will be mixing with the pa system listen take a walk around the room while the music is playing and note how it sounds different than it does when you listen to it in headphones or your home stereo this is why you need a familiar piece of music your goal is to eliminate or reduce as much as possible these differences so that what is coming from your cd player is reproduced by the pa system as accurately as possible adjust your graphic equalizer with your music playing start at the low end of the equalizer and systematically boost each frequency one at a time evaluate the sound as you boost each frequency if adding more of a particular frequency makes the music sound worse turn that frequency down until the music sounds lacking in that frequency range if adding more of a particular frequency improves the sound of the music leave it flat neither boosted nor attenuated for now be careful when boosting high midrange and high end frequencies as they can be piercing if boosted too loud it is not necessary to boost any frequency all the way up just up enough that you can hear the difference listen again walk around the room again once you have gone through each band on the graphic equalizer with the music still playing again you are listening to how the music sounds different than it does in headphones or another familiar playback system bypass the eq and compare press the bypass button or toggle switch on your graphic equalizer listen to the difference between the eqed sound and the bypassed sound this will show you exactly what you have changed with the graphic eq and if some of your attenuation might be too extreme or not extreme enough you may want to walk around the room while somebody else operates the bypass control adjust until it sounds good basically this entire article could be summarized as play with the graphic equalizer until it sounds good it sounds really simple and it is it may take you a while to get the hang of it but the more you do it the better you will get all that the fancy computer software for pa tuning does is play noise through the system the frequencies and proportions thereof are already known and then analyses the sound coming back and measures the difference between the sound it sends out and the sound it gets back this is basically all that we re doing here except a little bit less precise and with more room for personal taste,Computers-and-Electronics

how to hook up surround sound,this wikihow teaches you how to hook up a surround sound system to your tv,examine your available speakers the way in which you set up the speakers depends on how many you have the most common setups are 2 1 5 1 and 7 1 where the number before the decimal refers to the number of speakers and the 1 refers to the use of a subwoofer 2 1 is two front speakers and a subwoofer 5 1 is two front speakers a center speaker two surround speakers and a subwoofer 7 1 is two front one center two surround two back and a subwoofer determine your tv s audio type on the back or side of your tv you should see an audio out or similar section with at least one of the following types of audio output optical a hexagonal port optical audio is the newest and clearest type of audio and most modern receivers support it hdmi a thin hexagonal slot hdmi supports both audio and video nearly all modern receivers support hdmi av white and red circular ports these are used for basic audio all receivers should support av input make sure that you have an audio receiver unlike powered speakers the average surround sound speaker can t project audio on its own a receiver takes the sound from your tv and transmits it to the connected speakers via wires most surround sound kits include a receiver if you bought your surround sound set second hand you may have to buy the receiver separately all speakers will connect to your receiver via av cable but the receiver can use optical hdmi or av cables to connect to your tv make sure that your receiver s audio input matches your preferred audio output on your tv verify that you have all of the cables that you need you ll need speaker wire to attach the speakers to each other av cables the red and white cables to attach the speakers to the receiver and an optical hdmi or av set of cables to connect the receiver to the tv s audio ports if you don t have the proper cables you can find them online or in tech department stores online is usually cheaper read your surround sound system s manual each surround sound system will have a slightly different set of instructions detailing the best way to set it up while you can follow general instructions to get decent sound out of your speakers the best way to optimize them for perfect sound is by reading their manual first turn off and unplug your tv once your tv is off and completely unplugged from its power source you can proceed with placing and connecting the speakers arrange the speakers and their wires before connecting anything this process is known as blocking and it helps you ensure that you ll be able to optimize your speaker placement without having to stretch out wires move furniture and so on place the subwoofer near the center of the home theater the subwoofer is omnidirectional sound which means you will achieve similar results no matter where the subwoofer is placed many people like to place it towards the front of the configuration so that it is easily connected to the receiver although subwoofers are omnidirectional placing them against walls and corners will amplify the bass making it difficult to control place the front speakers on each side of the tv if the speakers are marked as left and right make sure that they re on the correct side as per their manual s instruction front speakers should be placed the same distance from either side of the tv e g three feet on each side angle the front speakers towards the audience each speaker should be angled in slightly so that it points directly toward the center of the seating area you should be able to draw a symmetrical triangle between the two speakers and the center of the seating area if you can raise your front speakers to ear level you will notice a marked difference in sound quality if you re setting up a 2 1 system you can now proceed to the next part place the center channel speaker above or below the tv the center channel bridges the gap between the left and right speaker it helps when sound pans from left to right and keeps dialog synced with moving mouths on the screen 1 x research source angle the center channel up or down so that it points at the audience do not place the center channel behind the tv or you will not be able to hear it place the surround channel speakers to the side of the viewing area your two surround speakers should be placed on either side of the viewing area pointed directly at the audience you can place them slightly behind the viewer if you aren t using 7 1 as long as they are still pointed directly at the viewer the surround channel speakers are what give the effect of sound happening around the viewer they do not transmit as much sound as the front speakers but they enhance the action on the tv by enveloping the viewer raise the surround channel speakers your surround speakers should be placed about two feet above ear level and angled down slightly so that they point at the audience if you are setting up a 5 1 system you are done with speaker placement and can proceed to the next part place the back channel speakers behind the viewing area try to place the two back channel speakers as close to each other as possible this creates a bubble of sound around the audience the back channel speakers should be the same height as the surround speakers 2 x research source place your receiver near your tv the receiver must be close enough to both the tv and a power source that you can adequately plug it into both your receiver may also need plenty of room to vent heat so don t lock it in a cabinet examine how your speakers connect most surround sound systems have ports for each speaker that you simply plug the appropriate connector into some older systems have clips that you plug bare speaker wire into to accomplish this you ll need to strip some of the wire away with wire cutters and then clip them into place on the back of the speaker run wire from each speaker to the receiver do everything you can to hide your wires as you run them as doing so will prevent people or animals from accidentally tripping on them and pulling your speakers if you can run the wires under the carpet or through the wall make sure to leave some slack at each end to keep the connection from becoming stressed connect the speakers to each other connect one end of your speaker wire to the back of a speaker then connect that speaker to another speaker in sequence each of your speakers should be connected in a line around your room from one front speaker all the way around to the other front speaker you ll connect the front speakers to the receiver via av cables do not connect the front speakers to one another via speaker wire exclude your subwoofer from this process unless otherwise directed by the manual subwoofers almost always plug directly into the audio receiver connect the subwoofer most subwoofers connect to the receiver via a standard set of av cables the subwoofer port on the receiver is typically labeled sub out or sub pre out if your subwoofer has multiple inputs connect to the one labeled lfe in or the far left input if there is no label plug your receiver into a power source your receiver will slowly power on after doing so though it may take several minutes to completely come online if this is the first time you re setting it up connect hdmi items to the receiver things like game consoles dvd players and cable boxes will use the tv s hdmi input as their audio output so plug these items into the receiver to route their audio through your surround sound you ll need to attach the receiver to the appropriate hdmi inputs with additional cables most receivers have an hdmi in and hdmi out series of ports e g in 1 out 1 etc for example an hdmi item that was plugged into hdmi in 1 would have an hdmi cable plugged into the hdmi out 1 port on the receiver and the hdmi 1 port on the tv itself the same philosophy applies to older items that use av cables or composite cables the red yellow green blue and white sets of cables connect the receiver to the tv for best results use an hdmi connection to connect the tv to the hdmi out port on the receiver you can use older connectors e g av cables but they will result in much lower quality most modern tvs support hdmi plug back in and turn on your tv once everything is connected you can power on your tv to see how your efforts turned out test out your surround sound each tv will have a different way of configuring audio but you can normally change your tv s audio preferences by pressing the menu button on the remote selecting audio and finding the default output area most newer surround sound systems have an automatic setup process that involves placing a connected microphone in the middle of the viewing area and allowing the speakers to read the ambient sound levels if your surround sound doesn t feel correct to you try adjusting your tv s settings and the items to which the surround sound is connected before physically adjusting the speakers,Computers-and-Electronics

raised bump on both the f and j keys these will allow your fingers to find the home position without having to look at the keyboard type each key from left to right type each letter covered by the fingers in the home position going from left to right a s d f j k l you shouldn t have to move your fingers from their home positions just press the keys they are resting on repeat but this time capitalize repeat the step above but this time in capital letters a s d f j k l use the shift key to capitalize rather than the caps lock push the shift key by moving only your nearest pinkie finger and pressing and holding it while pushing the desired letter with your other hand in other words when the letter you would like capitalized is typed with your left hand you press the right shift key with your right pinkie when the letter you would like capitalized is typed with your right hand you press the left shift key with your left pinkie become familiar with the rest of the alphabet learn

only at the screen as you type 4 x research source it will be slow at first and you may need to sneak a peek at the keyboard from time to time but soon your fingers will be able to find the right keys without much difficulty a good tip during this early stage is to say the name of the letter as you type it this will help your brain associate that letter with the appropriate finger movement focus on accuracy rather than speed speed is pointless if you have to go back and correct mistakes after every sentence this is why it s essential that you focus more on accuracy than on speed in the beginning if you make a mistake go back and correct it immediately try to do so without looking at the keyboard if you find you are making a lot of mistakes slow down your first priority should be 100 accuracy

numbers if you don t learn how to use these additional keys properly you will find that they will slow you down for the rest of your life to avoid this make sure to incorporate all of the less commonly used keys into your typing practice type with quick and well defined motions don t smash the keyboard that is don t just hit keys without aiming first this will often result in pressing two keys at once avoid thumping your fingers down each time your fingers and hands will soon grow weary and it ll feel like a chore instead of a tool in other words don t hit the keys tap them learn some

got the hang of it you ll never return to your old habits don t forget to practice numbers and symbols type phone numbers and addresses and incorporate the use of the various symbols just to practice them the more keystrokes you work on the more advanced your typing becomes practice typing random sentences here are some traditional typing lines that help you to master the art of typing repeat each

lever to the red dot for most typewriters engaging the shift lock key shifting the color control lever then depressing 2 central keys at the same time will release the type bars and raise the ribbon carrier if this doesn t work for yours you may need to consult your user manual 8 x research source if your typewriter didn t come with a user manual look online to see if you can find a copy there are websites designed by typewriter enthusiasts containing manuals for almost every typewriter model that has been produced pay careful attention to how the ribbon is threaded through the carrier once your ribbon carrier is raised look carefully to see how the ribbon is threaded so you ll be able to put it back in the same way if you need to draw a diagram to help you remember 9 x research source lift the spools straight up or press the release lever for a cartridge most vintage typewriters use ribbon spools if this is the case you will lift the spools straight up to remove the old ribbon some

spools into place or snap in the new cartridge once you ve discarded the old ribbon carefully place the new ribbon in the ribbon carrier exactly how the old one sat if you re using spools the ribbon should wind from the back of the spools a cartridge should easily snap into place 11 x research source remove slack from the ribbon once your ribbon is correctly installed you ll re engage the type bars to hold it in place release the shift lock key then carefully turn either spool to take up any slack in the ribbon 12 x research source clean the machine each time you use it use a small brush or
