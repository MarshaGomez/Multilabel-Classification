how to read a psychrometric chart,psychrometric charts are used by engineers and scientists to visualize the relationships of gases and vapors while the charts may look complex they re relatively easy to read when you know what each part of the graph is representing by identifying the axes and reading the markings on the interior of the chart you can plot points and draw conclusions from known measurements on the chart,look along the bottom of the chart to find the dry bulb temperature the horizontal or x axis of the chart denotes the various temperature readings in fahrenheit or celsius use the vertical lines extending from this axis to trace the measurements throughout the chart 1 x research source each labeled temperature will have one vertical line extending from the axis if the measurement that you are looking for is between the labeled temperatures estimate its location find the humidity ratio labeled on the right vertical axis the vertical or y axis of the chart marks the amount of moisture per pound or kilogram use the horizontal lines extending from this axis to trace the humidity ratio throughout the chart 2 x research source the humidity ratio is sometimes referred to as the mixing ratio or absolute humidity locate the uppermost curved line on the chart to find the saturation curve this curve connects the x and y axis and marks the relationship between temperature and absolute humidity when the relative humidity is 100 along this line note that the wet bulb temperature and the dew point are always equal to the dry bulb temperature the curved line gets its shape due to a rise in absolute humidity when the temperature increases follow the interior curved lines to see various levels of relative humidity on the chart you will notice various lines that follow the curve of the saturation curve these mark the relationship between temperature and pressure when the humidity is less than 100 in most cases each line away from the saturation curve represents a 10 decrease in saturation 3 x research source notice that as the temperature decreases the relative humidity lines become closer together until they are nearly indistinguishable look on the right side of the chart to find the vertical dew point line just to the right of the y axis find the line with the dew point measurement in degrees fahrenheit or celsius if you re having trouble seeing the lines on the chart use a ruler to align the hash marks with the lines on chart 4 x research source since the lines for dew point remain constant and flat throughout the chart the dew point does not change according to the dry bulb temperature locate the vapor pressure line to the right of the dew point line next to or along the same vertical line as the dew point measurements there will be markings denoting the various vapor pressures in inches of mercury or millibars again if you re having trouble following the lines on the chart use a ruler horizontally to align the hash marks of the vapor pressures with the lines on the chart 5 x research source like dew point vapor pressure remains constant even if the dry bulb temperature changes identify the diagonal specific volume lines throughout the chart the specific volume of the air tells you the amount of air that this chart was meant to measure normally within a range of a 2 3 m3 kg or ft3 lb as the relative humidity increases at a certain temperature the specific volume of the air also increases 6 x research source this measurement is helpful when using the chart to calculate the rate of cooling for a fan or coil find the diagonal enthalpy scales surrounding the chart around the extremes of the chart and just outside of the saturation curve locate the diagonal scales which represent enthalpy in btu per pound of dry air use a ruler to extend these measurements into the chart as temperature and absolute humidity increase the enthalpy also increases identify 2 known measurements that are on the chart when solving a problem involving a psychrometric chart you only need 2 measurements to read the chart pick any 2 known measurements available and plot them on the chart where the lines intersect 7 x research source normally you should give preference to measurements of dry temperature absolute humidity dew point or vapor pressure however you can also use relative humidity enthalpy and specific volume to make estimated conclusions use a ruler to locate other measurements at the point of intersection once you ve marked the point where your known measurements intersect use a ruler to follow the lines extending from the point of intersection to the various scales on the chart try to be as exact as possible when using the chart to read other measurements and mark your answers in the proper units for that measurement 8 x research source for example if you know the dry temperature and absolute humidity readings you can use a ruler to gather information about the dew point relative humidity specific volume enthalpy and vapor pressure visualize 2 measurements by comparing them on the chart if you re calculating a change in any of the measurements over time plot the points on the chart and gather all of the measurements possible for each point from the chart from there compare the difference in the measurements and make note of how the change affected the air 9 x research source this is especially useful for visualizing how a change in temperature absolute humidity dew point or vapor pressure affects relative humidity enthalpy or specific volume,Health
how to know if you sprained your finger,sprained fingers are relatively common injuries in sports like football and basketball fortunately although a sprained finger can be uncomfortable and get in the way of day to day activities it s not a serious injury 1 x research source you can tell if your finger is sprained by seeing if it cramps or turns red and by examining whether or not it s swollen

the primary signs of a sprained finger if your finger was bent uncomfortably far to one side or the other the ligaments connected to the finger s bones may be stretched or torn 2 x research source the tendons will swell on the side opposite the way in which the finger was bent so if your finger was forced too far to the left look for swelling on the right side of the finger inspect the bottom of your finger if the finger was bent backwards notice if the soft underside of your finger seems puffier than usual if so this is a sign that the finger has been sprained and that the ligaments near the base of your finger have been stretched or torn 3 x research source if you re not sure whether or not the finger is swollen compare it with the corresponding finger on your other hand see if parts of your finger have turned a shade of red along with swelling the most notable sign of a sprained finger is red discoloration inspect the sides and bottom of your finger if the finger is more red than the surrounding fingers it s likely sprained 4 x research source the degree of redness will vary with the severity of the sprain so if your finger is lightly sprained the skin covering the sprained tendon may be slightly pink if the sprain is severe a large portion of the finger may be notably bright red try to use the finger normally after the injury if you re concerned that your finger may be sprained try to use it as you typically would for the next day or 2 if you notice that the finger doesn t function normally doesn t bend can t hold weight or is too painful to use it s most likely

your finger was at when it was injured and what direction the injury came from tell the doctor how severe the pain is and whether it s become more or less painful with time 10 x research source also make an appointment if you have a mallet finger since the condition needs to be treated by a medical professional request an imaging scan if your doctor can t visually confirm a sprain the doctor will most likely perform an x ray or an mri scan both of these scans allow the doctor to get a clear image of the bones and ligaments in your finger an mri in particular will allow the doctor a clear look at the ligaments inside your injured finger after viewing the scan results the doctor will be able to diagnose whether or not your finger is sprained 11 x research source neither the x ray procedure or the mri procedure should cause any pain or discomfort,Health

event of a serious health scare approach the subject with care don t back them into a corner cornering your loved one may make them even more resistant to help have an easy going conversation with no pressure choose a time when you are both relaxed and able to talk without distractions bring the subject up casually for example you might say mom when was the last time you saw a doctor or jody had to leave early to take his dad to the clinic it made me remember that you haven t gone in a while state your concerns clearly and with love if your loved one isn t open to a casual suggestion you will need to approach the discussion head on be clear and direct about your concerns especially if their health is in a critical state you might say mom i can tell that your arthritis is getting worse you didn t even get out of bed yesterday i love you and i am worried i would feel so much better if you saw a doctor keep in mind that you may have to repeat this step several times before your loved one truly starts to consider your suggestions ask questions if your loved one continues to show reluctance about seeing a doctor you may want to probe them for more information figuring out where the root

relatives a respected family friend or community leader may be able to bring up the topic in a way that your relative is receptive to pinpoint who in your loved one s life they hold in high esteem

address your loved one s needs while easing their distress too offer to get a checkup too your relative may feel less distress if you join them at the doctor s visit as a patient too this may release them from the pressure that they alone have a problem make it casual and relaxed like you both simply need to get a yearly examination your loved one may be more inclined to see the doctor with this approach 5 x research source for example you might say dad i was thinking we could schedule our checkups together this year i know that going with you will make me far less nervous than going on my

how to maintain your health,health is something that is easy to take for granted when we start losing it it s hard to believe we spent so long not valuing it to ensure that you stay as healthy as possible we ve outlined a guide that should help you do just that detailing your physical mental and emotional health why would you want to live any other way,emphasize fruits and veggies a healthy diet is one that s full of vitamins nutrients and color well in addition to being balanced and the easiest way to do this is through piling on the fruits and veggies they re nutrient dense but not calorically dense meaning you can eat bunches and bunches without destroying your waistline and it s good for you and of course the fresher the better most all fruits and veggies are good for you but some are better for you than others arguably if you really want to zero in on mother nature s power you ll add kale spinach carrots celery cranberries blueberries and pineapple to next week s grocery cart 1 x research source that s every color of the rainbow too add in lean meats low fat dairy products and whole grains as good as fruits and veggies are you need some other stuff in there to mix it up and stay balanced when you go for meat dairy or pasta make sure you choose lean meats low fat dairy and whole grain pasta that generally translates to white meat without skin low fat or non fat milk cheese and yogurt and brown pasta quinoa and oats when it comes to grains the browner the better white grains shouldn t really be in your diet if it s white it s been processed and all the nutrients have been taken out then it s just empty carbs cut out processed junk if it s in a package odds are it s not super good for you and if it s in a package that doesn t go old for years that goes double turns out the fda doesn t even regulate all the stuff that goes into them and your body doesn t regulate the additives either they re not even recognized as food like things your body just stores them away not knowing what to do with them gross the fda doesn t regulate all labels either words and phrases like all natural free range additive free and pure are just claims companies can make without retribution so if you re buying something packaged that makes a claim that seems unfeasible it s possible it is drink up the h2o if you re looking for a miracle on earth water is the closest you ll probably get stay hydrated and just about every part of you will stay healthy your skin your hair and nails your organs and even your mind and you can lose weight too studies show that you could lose 5 lbs in a year by just upping your water intake around a liter a day part of the reason behind the weight loss is that drinking water keeps you full but drinking cold water also ups your metabolism in fact drinking cold water 17 ounces to be precise can up your metabolism by up to 30 for 10 40 minutes so get icy with your workout and you could burn even more calories cook the right way since you re cutting out all that processed gunk you inevitably will find yourself in the kitchen more finally putting your passive food network viewership to good use cooking is great for your budget your skills and your waistline but here are a couple of things to keep in mind if you can go as raw as possible frozen and canned veggies are all okay but raw is so much better none of the nutrients has been taken out in the processing use the right kind of oils like olive or safflower they re full of the good kinds of fat do the same with cheeses butters and spreads try to find a lighter version of their full fat counterpart avoid frying and battering your foods chicken is good for you but not if it s covered in bread crumbs fried in fatty oil and doused in sugary condiments don t salt your foods the american heart association recommends keeping salt intake at under 1 500 mg a day that sounds doable until you realize that a teaspoon is 2 300 mg 2 x trustworthy source american heart association leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education go to source oof concentrate on healthy fats we ve already touched on it with cooking but there s even more to explore fats are necessary especially for your hair to be shiny your nails to be healthy and your digestive system working as normal but unsaturated fats are much much better for you than saturated ones that includes trans fats sources of good fats olive oil avocado and nuts all in moderation of course these shouldn t be used in addition to the food you normally eat they should be used as substitutes so instead of sauteing up those veggies in vegetable oil trade it for olive instead of grabbing that candy bar go for a handful of almonds they re still filling but your body can process the unsaturated fats much more efficiently exercise there is no way around it having a sedentary lifestyle is just about the best way to drive your body into the ground you have to stay active in order to stay healthy if you don t use your brain you lose it and same goes with your muscles so whether you want to run 5ks for breakfast or you just walk the dog every night do something your body craves it the cdc recommends 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity including some cardio and some strength building activities 3 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source that s 2 and a half hours by the way 2 5 hours out of 168 that s reasonable right and the

get wifi even losing 10 pounds can make significant improvements to your health moderate your alcohol intake and by that we mean 1 drink a day for women and 2 for men 4 x trustworthy source familydoctor org family focused medical advice site run by the american academy of family doctors go to source and no that doesn t mean 7 in one day of the week you can t bank em saving them for later 1 or 2 drinks a day keeps you healthy and you know not making stupid decisions be winning and by drink we mean 1 12 ounce can of beer or 4 ounces of wine or one ounce of hard liquor and if the drink isn t super sugary even better quit smoking you also probably know that smoking won t do your health any favors either and it takes a chunk out of your budget too and it can harm those around you is

play makes jack a dull sad unhealthy boy they just cut out those last two adjectives to make it sound more pleasing to the ear but seriously life needs a little fun or you re working yourself into an early grave and what s the point of living anyway if you re not having any fun so make it a point to set aside work and do something you enjoy all of life will seem better take some time every day and devote it to yourself whether it s meditating reading dancing around your living room naked or going for a walk do it and relish it you deserve it stay active in small ways sometimes it s hard to get a workout in between work social gatherings the kids and commitments we make that we can t get out of when those busy times spring up it s important to find other ways to get moving even if it s just 2 extra minutes of exercise it adds up if you do it every day examples park far away from where you re going take the stairs instead of the elevator do 5 minutes of core workouts before your shower wash your car by hand take your date to the park there are opportunities everywhere if you get creative keep mentally stimulated the brain is very much so a muscle it can get used to the paces you put it through put it in front of the television day in and day out and it will atrophy it ll become lazy but keep it moving and it ll stay fresh and raring for the next great adventure so turn off the tube and do something to challenge yourself chess anyone the internet makes this so easy pull up lumosity a sudoku or crossword puzzle memrise khan academy or coursera just to name a few possibilities there is very little you can t do with the computer you have in front of you so there are no excuses destress we talked about having fun before but we didn t touch very heavily on getting rid of stress though the two definitely go hand in hand but on top of having fun it s important to manage your stress levels high stress individuals eat more sleep less and are generally less healthy on the whole those hormone levels in your head affect just about everything the simplest thing you can do is to identify your triggers and not allow them in your life at least as much as possible then add yoga or meditation on top of it and declutter your space you re basically organizing your life making sense of it and then never relinquishing control sleep when we don t get adequate sleep at night our entire lives are affected we can t focus we can t pay attention we eat more our hormones get all over the place et cetera ad infinitum we all need around 8 hours but whether you need closer to 7 or 9 is an individual thing to make it easier to get good quality sleep start disconnecting sooner rather than later hopefully 2 or 3 hours before you go to bed so get off the computer stop staring at your cell phone and hit off on that dang remote control read take a bath or just chill with your family or roommates live in the moment prioritize your social network being social to humans is like breathing if we don t get enough our mental faculties suffer and we start losing our grip on how life should be so make time for your friends call up that family member you haven t spoken to in forever when you feel balanced when you feel like you re an integral part of a community everything else falls into place it s easy to get swamped with work or to just put work into your relationship but life is much more fruitful when you surround yourself with a blooming social network make it a point to every so often have a night with family or friends it ll be a stress release and you ll have more people to lean on when you need them a very very comforting healthy feeling step outside your box to keep your mind kicking do something you ve never done before go to a city you ve never been to pick up a sport you ve never played get creative if you haven t seen your artsy side in years find a hobby that s always intrigued you but you ve never gotten around to and make time for it you ll feel productive you ll feel like you ve accomplished something and bottom line you ll feel good just what the doctor ordered whether it s paragliding taking a cooking class or stepping into a big city without a map there will be something you gain from these new experiences even if it s just a crazy story to tell follow your passion really because at the end of the day life without passion isn t a healthy life everybody has a dream and even if you can t make it something you re able to pursue 24 7 it can be something that has its own little niche in your life so spend wednesday afternoon writing your book take guitar lessons at the age of 45 pack your bags and make that move you won t feel content without it happiness is an integral part of being happy and following your passion is a good way to ensure that your happiness is here to stay if it gives you that warm feeling on the inside it s meant to be never let your passions fall by the wayside they re there to keep your heart and

how to measure height,you may need a height measurement for your health a school project or a variety of other reasons to measure your own height you will want to use a wall marking method to measure someone else you can use wall marking a stadiometer or even a specially designed horizontal measuring board in all of these cases proper posture and head position is extremely important to measure objects or buildings install an app on your phone and it can do the work for you,find a wall to use for measuring you are looking for a wall that has unobstructed access it should be solid without a window or other cut outs it needs to be wide enough to fully fit the person s shoulders without them touching anything else the floor in the area should be level as well it is even better if you can find a wall that faces a mirror this will allow you to track your movements during the process which usually results in a more accurate final number remove all bodily obstructions the person whose height is being measured should take off their shoes place them to the side and stay barefooted or wear socks for the duration of the measuring process take down any hair accessories that could interfere with measuring process such as a ponytail if the person is wearing a bulky coat or jacket have them take it off 1 x research source one of the reasons that bulky clothing must be removed is so that you can observe body posture and make sure that the person is standing up perfectly straight when measured 2 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source stand up straight move to the wall for measuring place the person to place their back against the wall ask them to hold themselves up nice and straight for the entire time when you look at their profile from the side you should verify that the backs of their feet head shoulders and bottom all lightly touch the wall 3 x research source position their legs together ask the person to pull their legs slightly close to one another their weight should be balanced between both feet their knees and ankles should be close to touching or actually touching one another 4 x research source for some people with knee conditions this may be an uncomfortable position check with the person to make sure that they are not experiencing any pain place their hands and arms to the side of their body your subject may want to clasp their hands before them or cross their arms however this will have an effect on their posture and final height measurement instead ask them to purposefully hang their arms loosely at their side 5 x research source if you are measuring a child you might tell them to keep their body as straight as a board and their arms as limp as noodles ask them to look forward point out a spot across the room at eye level height and request that they focus on this area while you complete the measurement circle around the person and make sure that their eyes and ears are horizontal to one another in profile this is called the frankfort plane alignment and indicates that their head is in the correct position 6 x research source to correctly observe the frankfort plane you will need to be as tall or taller than the person being measured so have a step stool nearby to assist you if needed if you are measuring a child watch to see if they move their head around after taking a breath if this is the case you will want to re position their head and then take a quick measurement 7 x research source use the pencil mark method place a pencil in a horizontal position above the person s head with the tip facing the wall lower the pencil until it reaches the top of their head maintaining the level position slowly move the pencil tip toward the wall until it makes a mark get out a flexible tape measure place the tape against the wall and measure up from the floor to your mark you can use any marking device however a pencil is best as you can erase the marks when you are finished just make sure to make a dark enough mark so that it is visible when you pull away make sure that you keep the tape straight as you go up from the wall it should also lay lightly against the wall you can use a straight ruler instead if you so choose making a wall mark every 12 inches and then adding it all up if you are measuring yourself you can do this method too just make sure to keep the pencil level it also helps if you are using a wall opposite a mirror so you can track your movements use a stadiometer this is a piece of medical equipment composed of a measuring board affixed to the wall with a drop down adjustable rod at the top have the person stand against the board and then adjust the rod so that it rests on the top of the person s head with a manual stadiometer you will need to write down the height where the rod meets the board with a digital stadiometer the height will be displayed immediately after you adjust the rod 8 x research source it is not necessary to push the measuring rod down upon the person s head it is enough to lightly touch the head with the rod measure on a horizontal surface to get an accurate number you will need to have the person lay down on a firm area you can use an examination table in a doctor s office for a small child or a firm bed if you are measuring an immobile adult ask the person to look toward the ceiling lightly press their knees together and down until they contact the flat surface use a measuring tape to measure from the base of their feet to the top of their head 9 x research source be aware that this method is less accurate when used with taller persons so try to use a stand up wall method whenever possible 10 x research source this is often a good option for children who are moving around a great deal but who are too big for the infant measuring device and too wiggly to stand up against the stadiometer you can also make a pen or marker mark at the base of their feet and at the top of their head and measure between the marks this works well if you don t mind marking up a bedsheet or if you are measuring on a paper surface like at a pediatrician s office use a specialized horizontal headboard and footboard device this is the preferred way to measure infants you will lay the infant down in a measuring area you then pull the headboard and footboard toward the baby until they meet its head and feet respectively you measure from board to board to determine height 11 x research source some of the more advanced measuring devices found in pediatricians offices will actually show a digital display of the final measurement or distance between the boards record the final measurement if possible it is

soon as you have them to preserve accuracy 12 x research source record all of your measurements to the nearest 1 8th of an inch 0 1cm 13 x research source it is a good idea to take all measurements

object into the view frame this may take a bit of practice so give yourself ample time 16 x research source part of the calibration process involves setting the correct camera height it is best if you subtract 4 inches from your height and use that number just so long as you keep the camera at eye level take a clear picture of the object snap a few photos of the object and wait for the measuring magic to take place the app will display the height of the object and you ll have the option to save this information for later or even share it on social media 17 x research source if you doubt the

how to avoid unhealthy health goals,unhealthy health goals are all too common bad health goals often involve focusing too much on the outcome and not enough on the process of getting healthy bad goals include trying to lose a large amount of weight in a short time frame or training for a marathon without allocating enough time these efforts usually lead to weight gain if you do not continue them choosing a fad diet that doesn t meet your personal goals is another example of an unhealthy health goal to avoid unhealthy health goals you should focus more on the process of getting healthy direct your attention to small changes in your eating and fitness behavior that will allow you to gradually move towards your overall health goals 1 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source,aim for moderation rather than perfection being a perfectionist in your health goals may end up impeding your progress if you try to be perfect in your new diet and eating habits you may end up being so hard on yourself that you give up on the diet entirely instead aim for moderate or small improvements in your diet and try to stick to them consider whether your diet is negatively impacting your social life you may want to re evaluate your new diet if it is stopping you from living the kind of life you want to lead if your new diet is stopping you from attending social events with friends and family perhaps you should modify your dietary goals so that you can still have a social life 2 x research source there s nothing wrong with going out for ice cream or fast food from time to time as long as you have healthy habits overall you re fine check whether you are routinely cancelling social events to exercise cancelling a lot of social events with friends and family to get to the gym may be a sign of unhealthy exercise goals the strength of social connections with friends and family is an important factor in your health make sure you aren t sacrificing a healthy social life to get to the gym since you need both social ties and an active lifestyle to be healthy 3 x research source reflect on whether you view exercise as a form of compensation for poor eating you should not aim to exercise so you can eat more brownies chips or other junk food an exercise plan built around compensating for poor eating habits will not make you healthier instead you should focus on a well rounded healthy diet and a regular exercise routine 4 x research source exercise should not be punishment for eating something it should be something you enjoy or at least tolerate and that you can feel proud of accomplishing get medical help if you are unsure about your health goals ask your family doctor for advice on specific health goals that would be healthy for you 5 x research source in conversation with your doctor set specific and measurable health goals that are meaningful to you ask your doctor i see a lot of people doing the vegetarian diet do you think this would work for me inquire how much should i exercise each week if i want to lose weight by the summer for instance if you want to be able to swim a certain distance by the summer use this as a starting point for setting your goals the goals you set should be specific and you should be able to measure your progress over time focus more on healthy eating habits and less on a strict diet if you want to lose weight you may be tempted to start a completely new diet from scratch however abruptly starting a new diet often results in failure and yo yo dieting can harm your metabolism 6 x research source start small instead focus on adjusting your habits in little ways buy healthy foods that you enjoy eating look for fruits vegetables and whole grains the next time you feel hungry reach for those instead of eating in front of the television try mindful eating you may be consuming too much food because you are eating while spaced out instead of focusing on your food try to just eat and pay attention to the food which may help you to eat less 7 x research source stop eating late at night eating a lot right before bed tends to lead to weight gain 8 x research source avoid skipping breakfast if you skip breakfast you may end up overeating at lunch more importantly you need to eat breakfast because your blood sugar levels are low in the morning and blood sugar is necessary for your brain and muscles to function properly give yourself time to enjoy a relaxed and fulfilling breakfast 9 x research source aim to eat until your feel full instead of losing a certain amount of weight try to train your body to recognize when it is full this is better than than trying to lose a certain number of pounds which can often be a poor diet goal because it focuses too much on the outcome and not enough on the necessary behavior changes 10 x research source you can train yourself to notice when you are full by serving smaller portions and integrating a check in moment at each meal serve yourself a small portion after eating your small portion check in with your tummy and ask yourself whether you feel full give yourself five minutes for the check in before deciding whether or not to eat more food if you feel full after the five minute wait you don t need to eat more listen to your body when you feel hungry your body is trying to tell you something important eat what you need to eat pay attention to cravings what type of food are you craving salt fats greens identify the type of food that your body needs and look for a reasonably healthy food that fits eat when you re hungry if it s in between meals try a healthy snack don t eat food that you hate instead go for a healthy food that you can enjoy you absorb nutrients better when you like what you re eating 11 x research source for example if you like spinach but hate kale then skip the kale and enjoy a spinach salad give yourself one cheat meal a week if you are on a new diet instead of eating every meal according to your new diet plan give yourself a break by allowing yourself at least one meal where you can eat anything you desire you will eliminate the feeling that there is no way out it is better to aim for improvement as opposed to perfection so just try to stick to your diet generally and give yourself a break once a week 12 x research source notice if you feel a strong urge to binge on your cheat day if you are following a strict diet with one day of the week where you allow yourself to eat anything it is not an excuse to binge on unhealthy food choices 13 x research source if you feel a strong urge to binge it may be that your diet is too restrictive work on striking a better balance reflect on whether you are just following a fad diet your new diet may be unhealthy if you are simply following a new fad diet such as but not limited to the paleo diet or atkins diet although all of these diets can work great for many people and for a variety of reasons you should not follow a diet simply because it is new and exciting you should find a diet that works for you and adapt it to your body type health and fitness goals 14 x research source be cautious about diets that cut out major food groups these usually aren t sustainable if you do make the change consult a doctor first and try to do it gradually avoid setting goals based on external sources of information instead of focusing on goals like losing weight or looking trim find an activity that you truly enjoy build your fitness goals around an activity that you really like as opposed to focusing on abstract goals that you don t feel connected to instead of focusing on getting ripped abdominal muscles find a sport you like and join the local recreation league connect fitness to a hobby you enjoy if you are a photographer go for a walk with your camera and take pictures along the way instead of focusing on losing a certain amount of weight find an activity you enjoy that involves exercise and devote time to this activity if you enjoy walking in the park spend more time walking in the park and worry less about the amount of weight you need to lose 15 x research source break down your big goal into smaller goals instead of focusing on one huge goal such as lifting 300 pounds focus on small and measurable goals your goals should be measurable on a weekly basis if your big goal is to be able to do 10 push ups start with just 1 then 2 then 5 and so on if your big goal is to be able to bike for 2 hours straight first work on biking for 30 minutes then 45 minutes et cetera if your big goal is to squat 300 pounds focus on the small goal of increasing your squat lift by five pounds every couple weeks if your big goal is to lose fifty pounds focus on the small goal of going for a run every other day and avoid checking your weight more frequently than once a month change your exercise routine and pay less attention to outcomes instead of focusing on how much you want to squat at the gym or the distance you want to run focus on your training process if you make time to practice squatting a few times a week you should be able to gradually achieve your desired outcome pay more attention to your fitness process 16 x research source avoid expecting instant payback you should avoid the expectation to see instant results from your new fitness routine going to the gym three or four times a week should improve your overall condition if that is your goal but you are unlikely to notice immediate results such as a six pack or vast amounts of weight loss 17 x research source give yourself enough time to train you should allocate a proper amount of time for achieving your fitness goals if you skimp on time you may get hurt in the training process avoid injuries by giving yourself the proper time to train 18 x research source if you want to run a marathon and you are a beginner level

how to increase your lactate threshold,during physical activity your body produces a substance called lactate your lactate threshold is the point during intense exercise when your body begins to produce lactate faster than it can eliminate it when this happens you may feel sore short of breath and exhausted 1 x research source everyone s lactate threshold is different so try to determine yours before you work on increasing it raise your threshold by gradually increasing your training volume doing tempo runs and doing interval training you may also be able to boost your threshold with branched chain amino acid bcaa supplements,get your lactate threshold tested at an exercise lab in a traditional lactate threshold test a technician will draw small amounts of your blood at various points during an incremental exercise test the exercise test is typically carried out on a treadmill or stationary bike with the intensity of the exercise increasing after every 3 minute interval your blood will be taken at the end of each interval 2 x research source the average person will hit their lactate threshold once they reach about 50 60 of their maximal oxygen uptake vo2 max however trained athletes tend to have a higher threshold e g the lactate threshold occurs at around 85 95 vo2 max for endurance athletes lactate threshold testing in a lab can be expensive costing anywhere from 75 200 usd to find a lab in your area search for something like lactate threshold testing near me or lactate threshold lab chicago estimate your lactate threshold with a field test the field test is less accurate than a traditional lactate test but it will give you a general estimate of your lactate threshold set your treadmill at a 1 grade and do about 10 minutes of easy jogging to warm up then run for 30 minutes at the fastest pace you can maintain for that period of time note your heart rate at 10 minutes and again at 30 minutes and divide the sum by 2 to determine your average heart rate at your lactate threshold your average pace during the run should be the approximate pace you can maintain at lactate threshold 3 x research source this test works best on a treadmill that measures your time running distance and heart rate do this test at a time when you are well rested and not tired from recent training or intense exercise use a non invasive led sensor to measure lactate levels you can test your own lactate levels during exercise with an led sensor device that attaches to your calf these devices feed data into a smartphone app that can calculate your lactate threshold pace and heart rate the app also guides you through the test workout 4 x research source production of the most widely available device of this type the bsxinsight has recently been discontinued however similar devices are currently in development the bsxinsight device cost about 300 usd while similar devices such as the moxy muscle oxygen monitor may cost 800 usd or more the moxy does not measure lactate levels but can be used to get a ballpark estimate of your lactate threshold much like the field test 5 x research source set a weekly training goal the best way to start increasing your lactate threshold is to gradually increase your weekly training time work with your personal trainer or coach to set a reasonable target goal and discuss the best way to reach that goal 6 x research source for example if you are currently doing 100 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week you might set a goal of working up to 200 minutes per week if you don t have a trainer or coach ask your primary healthcare provider for advice they may be able to refer you to someone who can help you meet your fitness goals increase your training volume by 10 20 per week work up to your target training volume gradually to achieve the best and safest results increase your exercise time each week in increments of 10 20 whichever works best for you 7 x research source if you re going from 100 to 200 minutes of exercise per week at an increase of 20 per week you should reach your goal in 4 weeks keep the intensity light while you are increasing your exercise volume as you re gradually ramping up your total exercise time keep your level of exertion light and easy don t worry about using an objective measure of intensity instead focus on how intense the exercise feels to you 8 x research source the goal is to keep your level of exertion around 11 12 fairly light on the rating of perceived exertion rpe scale which you can view here https www hsph harvard edu nutritionsource borg scale your level of activity should feel comfortable e g walking at a pace that is not fast enough to significantly increase your breathing and heart rate vary your time per session you don t always have to exercise for the same amount of time during each training session work with your trainer to figure out what works best for you however aim for a minimum time of 10 minutes per session 9 x research source for example you might do a low intensity 45 minute treadmill session one day and 2 20 minute sessions the next determine your maximum steady state mss pace your maximum steady state mss is the maximum running speed you can maintain without your lactate levels spiking if you can t determine your exact mss e g using lactate testing in a lab estimate it by assessing your level of exertion during running you should feel like you are exercising somewhat hard to hard 13 15 on the rating of perceived exertion scale 10 x research source a good general measure of exertion is how heavily you are breathing and how fast your heart is beating when you are exercising somewhat hard your heart rate and breathing should be slightly elevated but you won t feel out of breath at a hard level of exertion you should be breathing fast and feel your heart speeding up or pounding 11 x research source your mss pace is typically a pace that you could maintain for up to an hour 12 x research source if you can find your exact mss pace by doing a test in an exercise lab incorporate tempo runs into your weekly workout routine a tempo run is a run that is performed at your mss pace right at your lactate threshold incorporating tempo running or some other steady state exercise into your regular routine can help gradually increase your lactate threshold devote no more than 10 of your weekly cardiovascular exercise time to tempo running or other steady state exercises 13 x research source for example if you are doing 200 minutes of cardio per week do a 20 minute tempo run each week start with a 20 minute warm up before starting a tempo run do 20 minutes of running at a light easy pace you should feel like you are exerting some effort but not so much that you are breathing heavily or feel your heart pounding 14 x research source run for 20 minutes at your mss pace after you warm up it s time to pick up the pace run fast enough so that you feel you are working yourself hard but not so hard that you don t think you could maintain the pace for a full hour 15 x research source at this pace you may feel your heart beating fast and find it difficult to speak more than a few words at a time cool down with a light run after 20 minutes of hard running slow down to an easy pace again maintain the light run or jog for 10 minutes 16 x research source work out above your lactate threshold interval training is a type of workout that alternates short bouts of high intensity aerobic exercise with short recovery intervals of low intensity exercise each interval should only last a few minutes at a time the high intensity bouts should be done above your lactic threshold in other words you should feel like you are working very hard 17 18 on the scale of perceived exertion at around the highest level of activity you can sustain for longer than a few minutes at a time 17 x research source at this level of exercise you will feel your heart pounding very fast and may be breathing hard enough that it is difficult to speak 18 x research source incorporate interval training into your weekly routine to get the most out of interval training plan to do 1 session every week however to avoid injury and overwork interval training should account for no more than 10 of your weekly cardiovascular activity 19 x research source for example if you are doing 200 minutes of cardio each week do no more than 20 minutes of interval training total per week if you are also doing steady state exercises like tempo runs avoid scheduling this type of exercise close to your weekly interval training give yourself 2 days to recover between these types of training develop a high intensity interval training routine there are many ways to do high intensity interval training hiit work with your trainer or coach to choose a routine that works best for you for example you might try 4 rounds of the following routine with 12 second periods of inactivity between each exercise 20 x research source 35 seconds of drop lunges 35 seconds of burpee crunches 35 seconds of plank jack hops 35 seconds of step to jump squats 35

how to put ecg leads on a chest,the egc electrocardiogram is used to measure a patient s heart s electrical activity the test is commonly used to check for many heart conditions from coronary heart disease to a heart arrhythmia if you re a medical professional you may find yourself needing to attach the 10 egc leads to a patient s chest out of the 10 leads 6 are positioned on the patient s chest and 4 of the leads are set on the patient s limbs it s important that you position the leads correctly since incorrect lead placement can cause improper diagnosis or result in a misreading of the test,ask the patient to recline on their back ecg tests are always administered with the patient lying flat on their back not only does this position make it much easier to find the correct places to situate the ecg leads but it also keeps the patient s heart beating at its resting rate if you re in a doctor s office just have the patient lay back on an examination table 1 x research source if you re giving an ecg test in a patient s home ask them to recline on their bed or couch gain verbal consent to the procedure from the patient explain that you re about to place 10 leads on the patient s body to electrically monitor their heartbeat clarify that the test will not hurt but that the leads will need to remain in place for 3 5 minutes ask the patient to take a few deep breaths and completely relax 2 x research source if the patient is female they may feel more comfortable with a female doctor or nurse placing the ecg leads on their chest clean the patient s chest before you place the leads if the patient s skin is dirty or oily clean it with soap and water and dry with a towel before applying the ecg leads dirt and oil can interfere with the electrical readings from the leads they ll also have a much harder time sticking onto a dirty chest if a patient has chest hair where the leads should be placed you ll need to shave off the hair 3 x research source it s also a good idea to either wash your own hands or put on a pair of latex gloves before putting on the ecg leads if you don t have soap and water available you can also use an alcohol cleaning pad to remove dirt and oil unpack the ecg leads and read the color coding system the leads used in an ecg exam are color coded there will be a chart on the ecg packaging that lets you know which color corresponds with which lead the 6 chest leads are medically referred to as the v leads they re numbered v1 through v6 with v1 being the first lead applied and v6 being the last 4 x research source the 4 leads that you ll place on the patient s arms and legs should also be color coded they may be packaged separately from the torso leads to avoid confusion find the angle of louis to determine chest electrode placement set your fingers at the base of the patient s throat and slide them slowly down until you feel the top of the sternum slide your fingers down across the sternum another 5 6 inches 13 15 cm until you reach the sternum s widest part this is the angle of louis you ll know you ve arrived at the angle of louis when until you feel a bony lump where the 4th rib connects to the patient s sternum knowing the location of the angle of louis will help you place the ecg electrodes 5 x research source having the patient reclining makes it much easier to find the angle of louis if it helps practice finding the angle of louis on yourself a few times before you find it on a patient place v1 between the patient s ribs on the right side of their sternum move your fingers to the right of the angle of louis as your fingers slide right you ll feel a gap between the patient s ribs slide your fingers down across 1 more rib until you come to the next gap between ribs place the first lead here to set the lead press it firmly into place the leads are lightly adhesive and will stay in the location you put them 6 x research source v1 should be located between the patient s 4th and 5th ribs counting down from the top set v2 across the patient s sternum from v1 place your hand back onto the patient s angle of louis and this time slide your hand to the left find the gap between the patient s ribs and as with v1 slide your fingers down across 1 more rib set electrode v2 in that gap between ribs as close to the patient s sternum as possible 7 x research source v2 should essentially mirror the placement of v1 but on the left side of the chest position v4 beneath the midpoint of the patient s left clavicle from where you just placed electrode v2 slide your fingers down 1 more rib until you can feel the space between 2 ribs again then slide your fingers to the right this will be going farther left from the patient s point of view place v4 directly under the midpoint of the patient s left clavicle in the space between 2 ribs 8 x research source the clavicle is the collarbone it often slightly protrudes just below the patient s neck set v3 directly between nodes v2 and v4 don t worry about lining v3 up with a gap between ribs in fact on most patient s bodies it will sit directly over a rib just eyeball half of the distance between electrodes v2 and v4 and stick v3 in that position 9 x research source if you re working with a female patient leads v3 through v6 will be positioned beneath not on top of the patient s left breast situate v5 at the same height as v4 below the patient s axilla slide your fingers right along the gap between ribs follow the gap between the patient s ribs where you placed v4 move your fingers to the right left from the patient s point of view and follow the gap move your fingers until they re directly beneath the beginning of the patient s underarm press v5 into place here 10 x research source in medical terminology the underarm area is known as the axilla set v6 directly under the center of the patient s left underarm continue moving your fingers to the right the patient s left along the line of the gap between 2 ribs that you ve been following keep moving until your fingers are directly beneath the center of the patient s underarm place v6 there still in the gap between the patient s ribs 11 x research source it s a good idea to always position the chest leads before positioning the extremity electrodes the chest electrodes are more important and they need to be much more precisely located stick 1 lead to the patient s right shoulder below the clavicle fix a lead on the patient s arm on the shoulder about 2 inches 5 1 cm below the patient s clavicle press the lead firmly onto the patient s skin to fix its position 12 x research source if you can t position the lead here for some reason e g the patient has a skin lesion place the lead higher up on the patient s shoulder you can also place it farther out away from their neck if necessary the lead for the right shoulder is usually white press 1 lead onto the left shoulder below the clavicle as on the right arm this lead should fall about 2 inches 5 1 cm below the clavicle place the lead at roughly the same location as you placed the lead on their right side to ensure that both arm leads give accurate readings press down firmly on the lead to fix it in place 13 x research source if the patient has a defibrillator on their chest or has a pacemaker do not place the ecg lead on the electrical device instead move the lead 1 inch 2 5 cm in any direction so it s directly on top of the skin the lead that goes on the left shoulder is usually color coded black fix a lead onto a fleshy spot on the patient s right ankle you have quite a bit of leeway when sticking the leads onto a patient s ankle especially when compared with sticking them onto the patient s chest aim to place the lead just below the patient s ankle bone where there s a fleshy patch avoid placing the lead directly over a bony part of the ankle 14 x research source if the patient is wearing socks and shoes ask the patient to remove them so you can put on the lead the right ankle lead typically has a green color press a lead onto the patient s left ankle below the ankle bone just like with the right ankle position the lead on the ankle over a fleshy patch if the patient has a very bony ankle you could position the lead at the top of the patient s instep make sure to position the lead on the left ankle in roughly the same position as on the right ankle 15 x research source it s more important that the leads be symmetrically positioned than they be on any exact location on the ankles the lead that goes on the left ankle tends to be red,Health

how to store ascorbic acid,ascorbic acid or ascorbate is another name for vitamin c ascorbic acid helps your body grow and repair itself and is an essential nutrient unfortunately it is also very delicate and breaks down rapidly when exposed to oxygen heat or sunlight it s impossible to prevent ascorbic acid from degrading but you can slow the process down by storing it properly,keep ascorbic in a sealed opaque container ascorbic acid is very sensitive to oxygen and light to make it last as long as possible store it in an opaque container with a tight fitting lid any ascorbic acid you purchase usually will come in one of these containers so you won t have to transfer it before storing it however move it into a more appropriate container if needed 1 x trustworthy source university of rochester medical center leading academic medical center in the u s focused on clinical care and research go to source avoid storing ascorbic acid in metal containers ascorbic acid pills and powders for instance sometimes come in boxes or bags they are fine in their original containers as long as you re able to keep them sealed if you have a box of ascorbic acid pills the pills will be sealed in foil packets you can just leave them in the foil store pills and powders in a cool dark area try to find a spot that stays at a consistent temperature 2 x trustworthy source university of rochester medical center leading academic medical center in the u s focused on clinical care and research go to source for example you might move the ascorbic acid to the back of a dark closet you could also store it in the basement if your home has one keep it in a spot where it won t be exposed to any sources of light don t store ascorbic acid in a bathroom or kitchen due to frequent temperature changes for long term storage find a different spot if you use ascorbic acid in a place like a bathroom remember to take it back out afterward it s a bit of a hassle but it helps the ascorbic acid last longer refrigerate liquid ascorbic acid to preserve it for longer the cooler temperature helps preserve the ascorbic acid for longer make sure it s in an opaque sealed container before setting it on one of the shelves the coolest storage spots are usually at the bottom and right next to the freezer 3 x research source light and oxygen exposure can still cause ascorbic acid to degrade in the refrigerator leave the bottle sealed and the door closed as much as possible throw out the ascorbic acid when it turns dark brown or red ascorbic acid is normally a pale yellow color most ascorbic acid powders and pills start off white although you may still notice a slight tinge of yellow in them as they age they darken at that point the ascorbic acid is no longer potent so it s a good sign that you need to replace your supply 4 x research source ascorbic acid is safe to use when it changes color but it won t have much of an effect oxygen converts the ascorbic acid to another form that your body can t absorb in general ascorbic acid powder lasts the longest pills can also last for years too liquid ascorbic acid spoils the fastest and may not last beyond 5 to 6 months even with proper storage ascorbic acid loses its potency over time it s best when used right away try to use ascorbic acid within a few months after opening it get ascorbic acid in pill and powder form for better preservation liquid ascorbic acid is fine but it s more difficult to store if you re taking a supplement then you can use ascorbic acid pills ascorbic acid powder can also be taken as a supplement or applied to skin they work just as well as pure liquid ascorbic acid despite not spoiling as quickly 5 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source some types of ascorbic acid are mixed in with ingredients like silicone to create a gel that is both long lasting and easy to rub onto your skin remember that ascorbic acid is vitamin c if you buy vitamin c pills or powder you are still getting ascorbic acid since they are the same thing choose more stable forms of ascorbic acid for longer storage l ascorbic acid is very common but it also spoils the fastest to ensure ascorbic acid lasts longer it is sometimes mixed with things like sodium or calcium the additional ingredients make the acid more shelf stable but less potent l ascorbic acid is 100 pure vitamin c so it s the easiest kind for your body to absorb 6 x trustworthy source oregon state university linus pauling institute research center dedicated to promoting optimal health through cutting edge nutrition research and public outreach go to source for example sodium ascorbate is less acidic than l ascorbic acid it s often used in diet supplements and can be good if pure ascorbic acid upsets your stomach calcium ascorbate is a similar option there are other types like magnesium ascorbate you can also buy products with ascorbyl glucosamine ascorbyl palmitate and other alternatives buy vitamin c serum if you use ascorbic acid for skincare vitamin c serum comes in a liquid or gel form it is usually made up of a low amount of ascorbic acid like 10 to 20 mixed in with other ingredients if you re able to avoid ingredients like water the serum will last longer a serum is easy to dab onto your skin so you don t have to spend a lot of time with the bottle open 7 x trustworthy source harvard medical school harvard medical school s educational site for the public go to source to ensure serum lasts longer look for varieties made from something like magnesium or sodium ascorbyl phosphate it will be less potent than a serum made from 100 l ascorbic acid but it will last longer in storage avoid serum made with water since the oxygen in water causes ascorbic acid to break down quicker instead try getting ascorbic acid powder and mixing it with water to create your own serum purchase ascorbic acid in opaque bottles that will last longer choose ascorbic acid that comes in a dark bag or bottle plastic containers are better since they block out more light if you re getting bottled ascorbic acid brown bottles block out more ultraviolet light than blue bottles avoid anything sold in a clear bottle since clear glass lets in the most light 8 x research source if you happen to get a brand in the wrong type of container transfer it to your own storage containers for example you might keep some old brown bottles on hand for storage make sure the container is well sealed if it isn t airtight then the ascorbic acid will spoil much quicker than usual buy small bottles of ascorbic acid to reduce waste since ascorbic acid can go bad within several months try to avoid buying more than you can use during that time look for sample sized bottles to start if you go through several bottles within a few months then you could upgrade to a bigger jar or start buying it in bulk 9 x research source ascorbic acid loses its potency over time so it s better to buy only what you re able to use within a few months that way you can replace it with fresher ascorbic acid in the future keep an eye on the expiration date printed on containers if you don t plan on using the ascorbic acid every day you might choose a product with a later expiration date such as a powder over a liquid,Health

circumstances finding a study involves some simple research before you apply for the study you will want to review your own health and medical history carefully once you have found a study that is right for you you can sign up for the trial with ease,look up local trials in a database there are many reputable websites that are used by researchers to identify potential volunteers these databases can help you find trials based on your location medical history gender age and risk factors the following websites are reputable sources for clinical trials clinicaltrials gov 1 x research source researchmatch 2 x research source centerwatch 3 x research source contact nearby hospitals and universities visit the websites of any nearby medical research departments or facilities attached to local hospitals you can also call these places or visit them in person if there is a specific study you are interested in joining contact the principal investigator otherwise look for a research coordinator at the facility to volunteer yourself as a general participant watch for advertisements posted around town if you live near a major research center university or hospital you may be able to find medical advertisements put up locally keep an eye on the posters found on buses subways and taxis read the bulletin boards at your local coffee shop by being constantly on the lookout you may find a trial that works for you they may even be advertised on tv consider the costs of the trial some trials offer monetary compensation and most will provide some level of free health care that said there may be many hidden costs in the trial cost of transportation some trials may be able to cover your transportation costs while others will expect you to pay for it if the trial is close by or does not require travel this will not matter that said if the trial is far away you may have to pay substantially for treatment cost of health care while the researchers will most likely cover any

source ask questions about risks and responsibilities because there are many unknown risks in medical trials you want to be sure that you know as much as you can about the study there are certain questions you should always ask before agreeing to do a study these include what potential risks are there do you know of any side effects how do the potential benefits outweigh the risks how long will the study or trial last what expenses are covered are all medical visits covered during this trial will i be reimbursed for other expenses what type of long term follow up care do you offer once the trial ends can i continue with this treatment even after the trial ends how will my personal information be used stored and protected what will i have to do how often will i have to visit the

how to get better health in 10 minutes a day,studies show that you do not need hours per week at a gym to benefit from exercise beginning consistent exercise with adequate rest between sessions can improve health most for those who were sedentary later if you are healthy enough make 10 seconds or more bursts of sprinting dashing or such as an example of extreme exercising for less than one 1 minute but those tend to be high impact caution any suggested exercise should be confirmed and agreed with your medical doctor,exercise on purpose do at least a little moderate exercise everyday this study suggests 70 minutes a week 10 minutes a day of added exercise can lessen your dangers of blood heart and arterial diseases and improve your quality of life read how this works as explained by dr tim church pennington research center baton rouge la he said our bodies respond very positively to even small amounts of physical activity for sedentary individuals the immediate health benefits are huge in fact those who have been doing nothing stand to benefit the most from increasing physical activity in terms of dying prematurely sedentary individuals who seldom get exercise may benefit by increasing daily exercise by several minutes realize the regular recommendation is to gradually work up to 150 minutes a week 21 minutes per day of exercise and this did not change yet recent studies indicate that results are apparent in half that time dr church also says of the study we saw a change in waist size which is associated with the most dangerous form of abdominal fat in just 70 minutes of moderate exercise such as walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike avoid perfectionism ie all or nothing thinking like i can t run fast for 4 minutes or jog for an hour so why even try and like you may underestimate the positive effects of less intense exercise like equating weight loss with fitness and despair if the scale doesn t change much reshape your thinking and shape up your health as dr church suggests that your walking a few minutes a day will reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease anxiety depression diabetes and many other conditions start with moderate exercise

with small lifestyle changes which are also easier to stick with but still provide lasting benefits by determination for continuing such sessions make this into a good habit by doing it consistently for two weeks and then increase your activity gradually buy and use an inexpensive pedometer many americans take only 5000 steps a day increase walking to 7000 or 8000 steps per day to reduce the risk of disease figure out how many steps you make a day and then aim to gradually add at least 1000 steps in a week 150 per day add more until you reach your daily goal make some changes like park farther away and walk from your parking place to shop at the store go to a zoo recreation area or a park on weekends with your kids or grand kids instead of sitting in a movie take a walk after breakfast or dinner some people walk in an air conditioned mall find other great benefits that may be as profound as the physical ones it always amazes people to see how little activity it takes to feel better dr

conditioning exercise for a very short time intervals of high speed effort and then an equally short rest interval on and off rest to lower your heart s pulse rate to nearly normal repeat the effort and rest rest by walking slowly some stretching and other low impact movements to stay warm rest for 1 to 2 minutes to recover to a moderate heart rate then go again exertion is to stay at that 90 level for only 10 to 20 seconds calculate your target heart rate for your fitness level if your fitness is not good keep the highest effort down to just 10 seconds until you get a better tone including better breath and lower your high blood by this cardiovascular conditioning push only hard enough but only for your 90 heart rate for that 10 to 20 seconds do not maintain your high intensity interval longer even for the most highly trained athletes only slightly longer for the desired result repeat these intervals for 10 to 20 minutes at first and increase it to only 20 minutes when you can do without fatigue so that is 10 to 20 minutes depending on your heart rate and body fitness level build six pack abs by changing to abdominal training when you have slimmed down and are

releases a story then that s a sign it might not be accurate check if other networks are reporting a story before you believe it as fact better yet check an organization site like the cdc for similar statements this can verify the news as true or false 14 x research source if fox runs a story one night but no other networks report on it within a few hours then it s a good bet that this story isn t

how to handle know it all friends giving medical advice,do you have a know it all friend who wants to give out unsolicited medical advice often times friends want to give advice with the best of intentions but sometimes it can just feel upsetting irritating and unwanted learn to cope with their unsolicited advice without creating a rift between you and your friend consider responding in a direct and polite manner know it alls may not have a good sense that what they say is bothersome by accepting that you can t control their behavior this may help to reduce your stress,accept that people may not behave as you d like know it all friends may give advice thinking that they re being helpful unfortunately they might not realize that they re doing more harm than good rather than getting upset or frustrated learn to accept that some people just don t behave as you d like while you can t control what other people say and do it s important to feel in control of your own behaviors understand that acceptance doesn t mean you agree with their behavior your friend may want to give lots of medical advice from their own perspective just because you listen to them that doesn t mean you have to follow what they say for example instead of immediately reacting when someone says something that you don t like or disagree with focus on how to stay calm and to think before you say something nodding your head thoughtfully before reacting can help to delay an immediate reaction recognize that sometimes your know it all friends may change and other times they may not set boundaries of what you re willing to put up with versus what you re not be polite and don t engage in debate if someone gives unsolicited medical advice that is far from helpful to your situation you may feel like telling them that they re wrong most likely this will just lead to more arguments about what works what doesn t and why from their perspective 1 x research source when a friend gives some unsolicited advice and at the end says i m just trying to help focus on the last part they think they have some helpful advice whether you agree or not focus on how to respond as if they were just trying to be reassuring if you re talking with them in person be patient and act like you are listening to their advice rather than ignoring them or trying to stop them immediately often times they just want to feel like they ve been heard getting into an argument will likely make you feel worse both emotionally and physically while it may be hard to stay calm when you or your family is going through a medical condition focus on how to reduce your stress in that moment breathe deeply consider ignoring unsolicited advice sent via email or social media while you may be inclined to

don t respond 2 x research source if you feel like it s safe to just ignore the email or message then go ahead you don t have to feel guilty about what you do particularly if you re not ready to

you wish to be more direct thank you for the information i m in the process of looking at all the options available to me and then i will make a decision tell them politely how you feel about unsolicited medical advice oftentimes we don t want to get into confrontations with friends and family you may be hesitant to tell them what s bothering you about their advice but it may be helpful to express in a calm and sincere way about how you feel 3 x research source consider saying things like i appreciate your attempt to give advice but i have discussed my treatment plan with my doctor and feel that this is best course of treatment at this time or i appreciate your help on the matter but i think i d rather talk about something else right now this approach might be best in person or over the phone after you ve said such information consider redirecting the conversation to something more positive ask them about their other interests or recent events be compassionate about their good intentions rather than acting defensive or upset by their suggestions be kind to the intentions of your friends friends want to help other friends but not all friends know the right way to do that 4 x research source if your know it all friends are truly your friends they are likely trying to be genuine in their advice they just may not know the right approach or lack the social understanding to see that it s unwanted for example let s say you have a treatable but chronic digestive disorder maybe you have flare ups and difficulty with your health from time to time your friend says just drink plenty of water and you ll be fine try to avoid getting upset and think about how they are just likely just trying to be helpful avoid throwing out their advice on the spot avoid saying things like i really don t think that will work or that s really not helpful at all just say thank you and change the subject focus on how to say thank you as a way to acknowledge what the person has said if you don t want the conversation to continue then focus on a smooth way to transition to a different topic for example a know it all friend gives you some unwanted tips on a chronic condition you have say thanks for your suggestions i ll take that under consideration pause what were you doing this last weekend i just saw this new movie and wondered if you saw it if you are knowledgeable about your friend s interests work or family consider redirecting the conversation to something about them they are more likely to move on to the new topic if it allows them to talk about themselves show that you are understanding of different opinions be open to the idea that other people have different opinions on a subject whether you agree with them or not don t waste your energy on trying to shut down their viewpoint on the situation and save your strength 5 x research source if you re going through a difficult time with your own medical condition or a family member s it may be a challenge to listen to what others say when you disagree or don t want to hear stay strong showing that you are open minded may lead to less stress along the way consider saying things like thank you i m going to assess the options in front of me and see what works best learn to politely stop friends who push their advice if someone is a know it all they may have difficulty with social cues and effective communication try to be polite yet direct when trying to get someone to stop talking 6 x research source be assertive by engaging in difficult conversation with delicacy and authority show that you are confident in what you re saying consider saying i appreciate your advice and understand your concerns i am talking with my healthcare providers about the situation and am continuing to advocate for my needs if i am in need of any further advice i ll be sure to ask recognize that know it all friends like to be experts on the matter maybe your friend has had a similar experience with the medical condition you have or maybe not either way they may come off as being an expert on the subject and feel the need to share their wisdom 7 x research source arguing with a know it all will likely lead to more arguments ultimately trying to prove them wrong or tell them they re wrong will feel like wasted energy consider saying simply thank you i know that s your opinion and i respect that then move on to a different topic or try to keep your cool be aware that many know it alls feel insecure there may be a need for others to give advice because it makes them feel smarter more interesting and more secure with themselves while they may not know that they re feeling insecure in some way it may come across once you challenge their advice 8 x research source they may want to feel better about themselves by giving advice they may feel like they already have figured out a solution and aren t open to your opinion be careful around these friends as they may be more sensitive to anything you say or do that is different from what they think is right for example if you say that you re not interested in their advice whether said politely or not they may immediately act defensive and feel hurt by what you say they may avoid eye contact or ignore you afterwards accept that know it alls don t see their advice as unwanted know it alls may have trouble with social cues or how to demonstrate empathy they may be more focused on fixing a problem rather than addressing your emotional needs consider telling them directly that you need their emotional support more than their advice right now say i appreciate your advice but right now i just need your support and reassurance don t assume that they know what you re thinking or feeling while just ignoring them may work sometimes other times it may work to be more assertive about what you re feeling help to teach them what you really need rather than what they think you need treat others as you d like to be treated while it may be tough to respond to your know it all friends with kindness it s important to model the type of behavior you d like from them show them respect and be patient 9 x research source understand that you may not be able to change their behavior but you can make efforts to control yours if necessary reduce your interactions with a know it all friend if it s becoming too difficult to be around them for example if meeting up with a know it all friend triggers anxiety and frustration limit those interactions when necessary such as at school or work rather than spending time after school or on weekends with them instead of focusing your energy on the people that irritate you think about the people who support you spend more time with the friends and family who make you feel

how to identify healthonism,it s quite possible that you ve never heard the term healthonism before as it was coined only in 2015 by j walter thompson intelligence 1 x research source 2 x research source if you ve heard of 10k races where the runners take wine breaks instead of water along the way or of yoga classes being held in craft breweries before tasting parties though you have some notion of the concept while healthonism more generally refers to a desire among a seemingly growing number of young adults to mix health consciousness with hedonistic desires it more specifically speaks to the mixing of exercise and alcohol consumption perhaps healthonism will end up as just another fad but it turns out that the seeming odd couple of exercise and alcohol has a basis in science,combine health and hedonism yes healthonism is a portmanteau the combination of the sounds and concepts from two other words for instance smog as smoke and fog creating new words in this way in order to identify new trends seems to be all the rage and the seemingly growing trend of combining healthy activities with social drinking has joined the club 3 x research source 4 x research source hedonism generally refers to a belief system that emphasizes personal pleasure and its pursuit above other concerns typically you don t think of a hedonist being concerned with exercise routines or diabetes risk factors so healthonism appears to refer to a trend with elements that come from opposite ends of the spectrum understand the phenomenon the trend tracking organization j walter thompson intelligence included healthonism as part of its jwti future 100 for 2016 and like many of the trends on the list sees it as being driven primarily by millennials who exactly fits in the category of a millennial is up for debate but for jwti s purposes it refers to people roughly between the ages of 18 and 35 as of 2015 5 x research source at its core healthonism seems to derive from the growing awareness of the importance of health conscious living paired with the eternal desire of young people in particular to throw caution to the wind and live for today it s a modern spin on the old notion of work hard play hard be responsible enough of the time that you can be a bit irresponsible some of the time find examples of healthonism healthonist activities can take the form of beer runs as you might find near a college campus or wine tasting 10k races in particular though it tends to be associated with events at nightclubs breweries or other establishments where special events that combine planned exercise and party elements can occur 6 x research source for instance a club might hold an event that begins with an hour long yoga session followed by a drink tasting event followed by dancing to add a bit more to the health side of things the alcohol may focus on seemingly healthier mixers that use antioxidant rich organic cold pressed juices for instance 7 x research source consider if there are deeper connections to this pairing even j walter thompson intelligence notes that healthy behaviors like eating better and exercising more tend to pair together as do unhealthy ones for that matter as opposed the the healthy less healthy teaming of exercise and moderate to heavy drinking yet the organization also recognizes that there does seem to be something more than a new fad behind this pairing after all there have been beer leagues in softball and bowling far longer than millennials have been around 8 x research source it turns out that scientists have also wondered about whether the anecdotal pairing of exercise with increased alcohol consumption has a basis in fact and the results indicate that there is indeed a correlation on days when people exercise more they are more likely to consume more alcohol than normal 9 x research source consider why exercise and drinking seem to go together legitimate scientific research shows that notwithstanding factors like age group or day of the week increased exercise and increased alcohol consumption tend to happen on the same day the trickier question it turns out is why 10 x research source 11 x research source at first blush it may seem like some combination of celebration and guilt is the likely cause that is an individual wants to congratulate himself for completing a triathlon

brain is stimulated by both physical exertion and alcohol consumption both of them activate your neural reward circuitry creating feelings of pleasure exercise triggers this response because of the advantages of physical activity since humankind s earliest times alcohol was embraced by our ancestors in part because they found that it just happens to trigger the same pleasure response based on its chemistry 13 x research source both exercise and alcohol spur a release of dopamine as well as endorphins both of which stimulate the euphoric feeling you can get after a vigorous workout or a few drinks with friends 14 x research source since the two activities tend to make us feel the same it is seemingly natural for us to want to pair them in order to multiply the effect or to keep the good times rolling beware of excessive drinking after exercise exercise and alcohol consumption may in fact be a natural pairing instead of the odd couple you might have assumed this doesn t necessarily make healthonism healthy however too much of either activity but especially drinking or too much of both can have negative consequences regardless of whether your brain rewards you with a pleasure response excessive alcohol consumption after exercise impairs protein synthesis in your muscles a process that is critical to muscle repair and building so basically if you drink too much after exercising you won t physically recover as quickly and any muscle building benefits will be decreased moderate alcohol consumption should have limited or no negative impact in this area 15 x trustworthy source plos one online peer reviewed open access scientific research journal go to source 16 x research source remember your calorie balance always keep in mind that alcoholic beverages are almost entirely empty calories without nutritional value also don t underestimate the calorie counts of alcoholic beverages and the amount of exercise required to balance out those calories without burning off at least as many calories as you are taking in there isn t that much health to healthonism after all 17 x research source for instance a pint of beer has approximately 180 calories meaning it takes the average person about one half hour of running to burn off two pints some simple math will tell you that if you go on a drinking binge you ll need to do a lot of running to make up for it also because alcohol is treated as a toxic substance by the body hence the term intoxication your body will focus on getting rid of the alcohol instead of other typical functions this means for example that you may burn less fat by way of your workout if you consume excessive alcohol,Health

a second time if you are not getting the result you hoped for or if you started with a food processor move the unground parts to a mortar and pestle apply pressure with the mortar and stir the unground parts to produce the necessary grinding action you may find that this produces the most fine texture for your flour if you are not satisfied with the output of your food processor or coffee grinder try the mortar and pestle keep in mind that this will require a lot of elbow grease however if you pre grind using a coffee grinder or food processor then this should be easier store your marijuana flour in an airtight container 11 x research source the marijuana s potency will be degraded by oxidation if not stored properly use an airtight container vacuum sealing will work great as well try to use it the same day or within 24 hours store in a freezer for long term storage 12 x research source substitute your marijuana flour for a portion of your recipe s requirement generally you are looking at about a 10 substitution but as much as 20 may be ok 13 x research source this is especially true for baked good that must rise such as breads unlike using infused butter or oil marijuana flour is a true substitution marijuana flour doesn t act quite the same as regular flour an alternate method of storage involves pre mixing your flour with regular baking flour store your mixture in an airtight container though just because it is mixed with regular flour does not mean it is protected from oxidation consider storing only pre measured portions in vacuum sealed bags in a freezer for optimal usage,Health
how to deal with geopathic stress,geopathic stress gs is the idea that the earth resonates with energy namely energy from its electromagnetic field with a frequency of about 7 83 hz schumann resonance although it lacks scientific proof 1 x research source the basic idea is that this resonant energy affects human health problems emerge when disruptions like underground streams sewers water and electric lines tunnels minerals and tectonic faults distort the earth s natural energy adherents of this idea claim that this geopathic stress and other kinds of electromagnetic pollution cause illnesses ranging from fatigue depression and sleep problems to diabetes and cancer should you be worried about geopathic stress no 2 x research source however some people think it is possible to locate and resolve sources of geopathic distortion,think about what kind of geopathic stress is affecting you start with specific questions about the type of stress you are under is there a stream flowing under your home or are there earth lines crossing to create an overpowering disturbance in your dining room try to be specific as it may affect what solution you take 3 x research source you may be dealing with not one but several sources of energy at once the distortion caused by an underground stream for example might well cross and amplify the force of a geological fault or vortex keep in mind too that energy patterns can be cyclical rather than constant if your own energy and health fluctuate during the year it may point to the disturbance for example a seasonal underground stream under your home use a dowsing wand dowsing is thought to be a way to discover subterranean water minerals or other objects the idea is to take a device like a wand pendulum or v shaped rod and hold it in front of you the wand points to the ground when you are standing over water or your desired object while dowsing has no scientific basis 4 x research source some people feel strongly that the attraction of the wand to the ground is a result of electromagnetic energy try dowsing yourself or bringing in a practitioner to help you discover the sources of your energy disturbance in order to dowse you ll need a wand or v shaped rod even a simple stick works start by holding the wand level in front of you then begin to slowly walk around the area in which you suspect there is a disturbance the wand will be attracted to the ground when you pass over such an area you can also use a pendulum to dowse or two separate wands that cross when you have located water or an object 5 x research source use a compass some people feel that compasses are also effective at locating electromagnetic disturbances to use one hold it in your hand and turn until the needle is pointing due north then move the compass over the suspected disturbance point the needle will alert you of any energy distortions by wavering back and forth 6 x research source since it is hard to hold a compass steady this method is best for small areas like a bed chair or sofa watch the behavior of pets or other animals the nineteenth century german geomancer baron gustav von pohl made a startling discovery cats dogs insects and other animals are naturally attracted to areas of earth resonance one of the simplest indicators of a geopathic stress zone is to be found in the behavior of animals look for signs around you 7 x research source cats for example will sleep over such spots if outdoors look for bee wasp or ant nests over the spot excessive amounts of slugs snails other insects or parasites is also a good sign of disturbance moles too burrow along geopathic stress lines 8 x research source rearrange your living space you may be unknowingly exposing yourself to geopathic stress there may be a disturbance underneath your bed your dining room table your bathtub or your your favorite chair if you have identified a potential trouble spot rearrange your furniture to avoid spending too much time over or near the point it may be that the disturbance covers a large area if you can t re position your bed or other furniture away from the stress lines you will have to consider other options like tools to neutralize the disturbance or to enhance your own energy field use feng shui to enhance your rearranging the traditional chinese art of feng shui studies the interaction of humans with their environment taken further feng shui can allow you to influence these interacting energies to improve your life find out more about its principles and apply them to your living space while the idea has no basis in science 9 x research source some people think that feng shui can specifically address geopathic stress this is because they see the earth s resonance as the unifying force between heaven s chi virtual and earth s chi actual the schumann resonance they think allows feng shui remedies to work better set up metal rods a popular and simple method is to place metal rods at strategic points in your home or anywhere you suspect a geopathic disturbance in order to block or neutralize the distorted flow of energy these points should be verified by dowsing to make the method work you ll also have to know the flow of the earth lines 10 x research source the rods can be copper brass or steel some people also feel that they can use other objects to redirect the flow of the earth s energy and resolve disturbances called earth acupuncture this method involves placing things like leaves crystals flowers or shells at strategic points create a cork barrier some people think that oak trees mysteriously developed a natural resistance to geopathic stress in particular the bark of the cork oak is believed to be effective as a barrier try placing cork tiles under your affected bed for example to absorb the geopathic chaos you should be able to do this on your own be aware that a cork barrier is not a permanent solution you have only made a barrier the basic energy disturbance is still there and will have to be resolved invest in a new age crystal buy a new crystal to shield yourself some people feel strongly about the healing and protective qualities of crystals which they say protect you from geopathic stresses but also through energy resonances in your own body and negative ions can stimulate your immune system and change toxic energies into beneficial ones 11 x research source quartz or shungite crystals work great amethyst zeolite and tourmaline are great at generating negative ions from moisture in the air make sure to wear your crystal at all times get rid of other sources of electromagnetic pollution the world is filled with sources of electromagnetic pollution that can magnify geopathic stress high tension power lines satellite towers electric poles or circuit breakers all send out high and low frequency energy that may increase geopathic stress as can everyday items like microwaves cell phones and wireless routers minimize your exposure to such devices 12 x research source for instance get rid of unneeded appliances if you can t keep them unplugged when not in use,Health
how to test iodine levels,iodine is a critical element for thyroid heart liver lung and immune function so not getting enough can be dangerous symptoms of iodine deficiency can start with weight gain feeling weak or tired hair loss constantly feeling cold and memory problems 1 x research source because iodine is not produced in the body you must get iodine from your diet fortunately iodine deficiency is easy to treat as long as it is diagnosed properly you can do a preliminary test for yourself at home using the iodine patch test but for a conclusive diagnosis you will need to get a blood test or urine test from your doctor,purchase a tincture of iodine if you don t already have an iodine solution at home you will need to purchase a tincture of iodine these are available at most pharmacies and drug stores as well as online 2 x research source while most iodine solutions have an orange tint some are clear be sure to buy an orange solution so that it shows up on your skin you may need to ask for it at the counter since iodine is sometimes kept behind the counter or in a glass case apply the iodine in a 2 in 5 1 cm square on your forearm using a cotton swab create a full square of iodine on your inner forearm the square doesn t need to be precise in terms of shape or dimensions but it should be conspicuous 3 x research source if you do not want to put the iodine on your forearm you could also put it on your abdomen or inner thigh be sure to let the iodine dry for at least 20 minutes before covering it or letting it touch anything since it will stain monitor the iodine for 24 hours to watch for any color fading check the patch every 3 or so hours to monitor how long it takes to disappear if the patch is still fully visible after 24 hours you likely don t have a deficiency 4 x research source if the patch disappears or fades significantly over 24 hours you may have a minor to moderate iodine deficiency if the patch disappears in under 18 hours you may have a moderate to severe iodine deficiency see a doctor for diagnostic testing the iodine patch test can help indicate if there may be a deficiency but it s far from a diagnostic test if your patch test indicated that you may have a deficiency see your doctor for a proper diagnostic test and management options 5 x research source depending on the severity of your symptoms you may want to consult with your doctor even if your test didn t indicate a deficiency especially if you notice you have an enlarged thyroid it s time to make an appointment with your doctor 6 x research source make a doctor s appointment your doctor is the one who can order an iodine blood test so you will need to make an appointment with them typically your doctor will order an iodine test in conjunction with other tests for things like thyroid hormone without you having to ask if you think you have a need for an iodine test though ask your doctor 7 x research source before the day of your test talk to your doctor about any medications you are currently taking iodine blood tests typically don t have a fasting requirement your doctor may order multiple tests for one appointment though so check with them to see if you need to fast prior to testing get your blood drawn after your doctor has ordered the test you will need to get your blood drawn in some cases a phlebotomist may come in and do that on the same day in most cases though you will have to go to the lab at or associated with your doctor s office to get your blood taken 8 x research source for an iodine test by itself you will generally only have one vacutainer tube taken discuss the results with your doctor in 5 7 days it commonly takes about 5 7 days for the lab at your doctor s office to process your test and complete your report your

how to grow a quality medical marijuana,medicinal marijuana is a popular alternative choice to treat a variety of medical conditions suffered by millions of people but while medicinal marijuana is popular depending on where you live it is also hard to acquire this is because the laws regulating the cultivation and distribution of marijuana vary from state to state and often conflict with federal law as a result depending on where you live the easiest way to acquire medicinal marijuana is to grow it yourself however while growing may be the option for you growing quality marijuana is an extremely difficult task fortunately though with some knowledge and commitment you ll be able to grow high quality marijuana in no time,secure an indoor space the trick to growing quality marijuana is to grow your marijuana inside growing your marijuana inside will allow you to completely control the environment this will eliminate the possibility of overwatering through rain lack of sun pest problems and other issues that plague outdoor growers but don t worry you don t need a specifically designed space to grow pot with a little retrofitting you can essentially grow your pot in any indoor space purchase lights and light proof a room perhaps the most important step in creating an environment to grow quality medical marijuana is to purchase and set up your lights quality lights and a good lighting schedule will make sure that your marijuana will grow and produce quality buds in addition you re going to want to light proof your grow room so light will not leak in during the night time or dark period make sure to purchase either metal halide or high pressure sodium lights the typical rule is that you should have 7000 7500 lumens per square foot in a grow room the number of lumens vary based on the light so consult the box or manufacturer before purchasing install surge protectors and use gfi wall outlets to protect against the potential of electrocution if there is a flood in the grow room consider buying a generator to provide backup power in case of a power outage lightproof your grow room by covering all windows with tinfoil heavy duty blackout curtains and more 1 x research source setup a lighting schedule a lighting schedule is extremely important to growing quality medical marijuana because you want quality pot you ll be completely regulating your plant s light source you need to be diligent about this schedule and do not stray from it straying from your lighting schedule may undermine the quality of your buds purchase timers so you can put your lights on a schedule your initial lighting schedule will be 18 hours of light and 6 hours of dark do not enter the room during the dark period this could trigger flowering do not let any light at all enter the room during the dark period 2 x research source provide proper ventilation and temperature control plants just like animals need fresh and clean air to thrive as a result you need to make sure that wherever you grow your plants has fresh and clean air in addition you need to make sure that the temperature and relative humidity of your grow space stays relatively constant to do this make sure your grow room has good circulation to move fresh air in and out you can do this by installing specially designed ducts that will move air in and out without allowing sunlight to creep through the cheapest way to do this would be to install bent pipes in a window opening and covering the left over space with plywood and or other materials use fans to further promote circulation make sure your heating and cooling system is running and is capable of providing cool and hot air to the space depending on where you are air conditioning might be the most important since your lights will generate a lot of heat make sure your temperature stays a constant 70 to 85 degrees fahrenheit the specific number in that range depends on the strain of marijuana and your climate many growers like to keep the temperature between 72 and 75 degrees when lights are on and allow the temperature to climb to 79 to 85 during the dark period get a good soil mix soil next to lighting is perhaps the most important element in growing quality medical marijuana make sure to secure a really good soil mix don t cheap out here soil quality and the nutrients in soil will determine the quality of your product consider your soil should drain well so that you don t have water accumulation that could hurt your roots and plant soils should have some sand sponge rock or pearlite in it have a mixture of fox farm ocean forest soil and half of any kinds of unfertilized potting soil this mixture will do the trick and this will help enable the root of the plant to access to the food nutrient freely include good fertilizer in the soil the type of fertilizer you choose can vary depending on your taste and budget 3 x research source plant your marijuana seeds the first step in growing your marijuana will be to plant your seeds while this is a pretty foolproof process if you ve done everything else right there are a number of things you need to do to make sure your seeds germinate and grow make sure to bury your seeds less than an inch from the surface provide water to the seeds after burying do not flood the soil just make sure it is wet several inches down plant extra seeds to account for seeds that don t germinate or seedlings that die soon after germinating 4 x research source water your seedlings and plants be sure to water your marijuana plants as often as they need to be watered if you don t water your plants enough photosynthesis may slow your plants will develop slower and your quality will suffer if you water them too much your plants could suffer root rot or other problems that will hurt quality to water properly make sure to wait until the top of your soil is dry to about an inch deep water your plants until 10 to 20 of the water drains out of the bottom of your growing container wait until the top of your soil is dry to an inch again before watering after some experience feel free to set up an automatic watering system that works on a timer this will save an experienced grower a lot of time 5 x research source tend to your plants in their vegetative state the second growth phase after germinating your seeds is the vegetative state the vegetative state is a period from 2 weeks to 2 months depending on the variety of the plant during this period your plants will develop and mature most strains need a minimum of 2 3 weeks in the vegetative state however you can choose how big you want your plants to be by how long you allow them to stay in a vegetative state make sure to give your plant enough water depending on size of the plant pot and other conditions make sure to give your plant enough fertilizer if it s not already present in the soil 6 x research source induce flowering once your plants have been in the vegetative state and are as large as you want them to be you need to induce flowering this is the major change in the lifestyle of your plants from when they will be growing to maturity to when they will begin to produce flowers and buds to induce flowering reduce your light from 18 hours a day to 12 hours a day do not let any light enter the room during the 12 dark hours in about two weeks you ll begin to see bud and flower development on the plants this will begin the flowering stage continue your 12 hours of darkness until harvesting 7 x research source monitor ph often the ph of your plant is extremely important in making sure you are growing quality medical marijuana this is because marijuana does not really thrive in soil that is too acidic as a result you should monitor the ph of your soil often to make sure the acidity is not too high test the ph every 2 to 3 days if you are going soil less hydroponic make sure to test your ph every day your target ph is between 6 0 and 7 0 if using traditional soil your target ph is between 5 5 and 6 5 if you are going hydroponic another soil less method use a digital ph pen or ph testing strips 8 x research source adjust your ph level after you ve tested your ph level and determined that it needs to be adjusted you can take measurements to properly tune the ph by adjusting the ph you ll help create the best environment to grow quality marijuana to adjust ph purchase ph up and ph down solution test your water s ph level follow directions on the solution s container and add enough solution to the water until you get the desired ph use the treated water to water your plants and retest after a few days continue adding solution for as long as needed or indefinitely if your water is out of the desired ph range 9 x research source flush your plants as the flowering stage comes to an end and your flowers buds are maturing you ll need to prepare yourself to flush your plants flushing is the process in which you stop adding nutrients and fertilizer to the plants and only provide your plants with an excess of pure water what this will do is make sure that nutrients are flushed out of the soil and or other medium you are growing in this will force your plant to rely on nutrient reserves this will increase the quality of the final product start the flushing process 2 weeks before harvest do not add any more fertilizer or nutrients for the remainder of the plant s life add enough water so that there is water at the top of the soil let it leech or bleed out of the bottom of the container repeat this step a second time after all of the water bleeds out of the bottom of the container if you are growing hydroponic make sure to swap the old water out for fresh water begin harvest process two days before harvest you ll want to take a few steps to make sure the harvest process will be done perfectly this will ensure the production of quality marijuana make sure to conduct another flush two days before harvest make sure to do this twice stop adding water one day before harvest adjust this process in future crops and try to make sure your soil is completely dry before harvest harvest your buds once your plants have budded and the buds have flowered it will be time to harvest harvesting is a very committed and prolonged process so make sure you have the time to do this and the space to do what needs to be done begin by cutting the plant from the root cutting larger branches to make it easier if you need making sure you leave at least two large branches removing all leaves this should be relatively easy because they would have started to die a week or two before removing all excess twigs stems leaves and anything without buds cure your buds after harvesting your plants you ll need to begin the curing process the curing process is extremely important and needs to be done right if you don t cure properly your buds could develop mold mildew or just dry out completely make sure to hang your large branches and the plant for 1 to 2 weeks remove smaller buds as they dry out remember you don t want them completely dry but maybe half dry the temperature of the room you cure in should be about 70 degrees fahrenheit the humidity of the room you cure in should be about 50 percent after you ve removed the buds from the branches make sure to put them in an airtight container open the container several times a day to allow fresh air in always reseal the container afterwards after a few days your buds will be ready find out about laws in your city and state before you embark upon growing quality medical marijuana you need to know the specifics of the laws governing medical marijuana growth and consumption in your city or state laws vary from state to state and city to city know them find out if you can indeed grow marijuana at the location you want to grow it some jurisdictions forbid growing marijuana close to a school or other public buildings make sure your location is zoned and is okay to grow pot at know how many plants you are permitted to grow as a medical marijuana grower these numbers vary from state to state and city to city you can be fined or imprisoned if you grow too much contact your local government police department or alcohol and marijuana control authority if you have any questions secure a permit or license if necessary find out if you need a permit or license to grow marijuana if you do get your permit or license before moving forward growing without a permit may result in substantial fines or jail time 10 x research source understand federal law before you grow medical marijuana know how federal law applies to medical marijuana while medical marijuana growth and consumption might be permitted in your city or state federal law may contradict it and is a higher authority consumption of marijuana for medical purposes is actually prohibited by federal law growth of medical marijuana is also prohibited by federal law while it does not happen often the justice department can prosecute you for cultivating or consuming medical marijuana 11 x research source know about distribution after you ve familiarized yourself with your local and state laws you need to understand laws and rules about distribution of medical marijuana in your jurisdiction and at the federal level you may be prosecuted for distributing your medical marijuana to others even if they have a prescription many states and cities require that people purchasing medical marijuana must do so with a doctor s prescription and buy it from a licensed distributor while the federal government may look the other way most of the time when it comes to medical marijuana for personal use you are much more likely to be prosecuted if you distribute your medical marijuana to others the danger of prosecution is especially high if you or someone else brings your marijuana across state borders 12 x research source,Health

afforded by herd immunity is reason enough to opt out of vaccinations know that your child will always be susceptible to preventable diseases if they remain unvaccinated this will mean for example that for the rest of their life they will not be safe to travel to places where vaccines are less commonly used talk to your family doctor if you are having a hard time making sense of all the information out there on child immunization speak to a physician about the realities of opting out of vaccines if you still decide to opt out tell your family practitioner or pediatrician about your decision and ask for help with the exemption paperwork which in some states requires the signature of a medical doctor 40 x research source ask the doctor what they recommend to keep your child safe from dangerous diseases try asking them if they can share any pamphlets or online resources for you to read make sure your doctor is aware of the current research and scientific consensus regarding vaccines and associated risks even physicians can be misinformed get a second opinion if you feel it is necessary in order to get unbiased information from your doctor keep any personal opinions about this issue to yourself during your first conversation your doctor may be more likely to relay just the facts if you simply tell them you d like to learn the details of vaccination pros and cons learn your state s exemption laws every u s state has different laws regarding mandatory vaccinations and the channels available if any to qualify your child for exemption research your state s laws and determine a course of action for legally opting out as discussed in the next several steps of this guide this information can be found online on various websites dedicated to vaccine legislation 44 x research source regardless of the method you choose for pursuing vaccine exemption you will need to complete paperwork that states your objection to state mandated vaccination this might consist of anything from a simple form filled out by the parent to an application that must be signed by a physician and submitted to the state for approval 45 x research source in some states your child must have an established doctor verified medical reason for opting out of vaccinations if you do not want your child to be vaccinated but they do not qualify for medical exemption they will not be allowed to attend public school opt out on religious grounds most states in the u s allow vaccine exemptions on the basis of religious objections although some like california have recently taken away this option after witnessing large outbreaks of preventable diseases if your faith prohibits your child from receiving medical care you can pursue a religious exemption from state mandated immunization 46 x research source depending on your state s laws this type of exemption may require a clergy member or other religious official to verify that you are a member of a church that subscribes to an anti medicine ideology it is unethical and irresponsible to claim religious exemption if this does not apply to you if you are opposed to child immunization for nonreligious reasons seek a philosophical

breathing exercises and meditation along with the physical movements 5 x research source avoid relying on anecdotal evidence while anecdotal evidence may interest you in alternative medicines you shouldn t rely on it as a trusted form of evidence there are many variables that might be contributing to what works for one person but not for another for example some treatments may work better on someone who s young and healthy or treatment may be less effective for someone with a certain genetic background for example you might hear someone say my friend tried this and it worked for her this anecdotal statement is not backed up by actual evidence look for scientific or clinical studies clinical or scientific evidence follows the scientific method and controls for as many variables as possible the goal with these studies is to determine what medicines work and under what conditions realize that sometimes it s difficult to control all variables especially in clinical human research studies a placebo controlled double blinded study is considered to be the best form of clinical evidence 6 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source with this type of study some of the subjects get sugar pills placebos while other subjects get the treatment being studied neither the doctors nor the patients know which treatment they re getting try to find high quality studies most approaches to alternative medicine aren t tested by good scientific research this can make it difficult to find good studies especially since not much funding is available for alternative medicine research this is largely because many scientific studies are funded by drug companies who wouldn t support alternative medicines also some alternative medicines aren t easily tested using the scientific method for example there s no way to deliver placebo acupuncture other reasons why research is limited include 7 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source 8 x research source different perspectives for example tcm has significantly different perspectives on how organs function and diseases are caused these often don t match western models of disease difficulty patenting substances herbs and other natural substances often used in alternative medicine can t be patented so it doesn t offer a financial incentive to study them interest many scientists aren t committed to researching alternative medicines read peer reviewed journals ask your doctor nurse or healthcare professional to recommend high quality journals the articles about alternative medicine should be peer reviewed this means that they were sent to independent experts for comment and criticism you should also look for impact factor if this shows how widely read cited and respected a journal is 9 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source try to look for evidence from larger studies that have been repeated you might read meta analyses these are papers that look at a group of studies on the same topic and analyse the data as a larger group than could be done for a single study go to the nccih website at nccih nih gov health this page provides information on what science is saying about current complementary practices in addition to providing resources to current objective sources of information watch for signs of misleading information it s easy to misinterpret studies because you want to believe their claims or maybe misinformation is all you can find because websites have copied and pasted inaccurate information to check for misinformation or misinterpretation 10 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source check the date if the information is older it may have changed for example there may be more evidence or older evidence may no longer be true check for validation see if the website has been checked for reliability by an organization like the health on the net hon foundation check the original references if you can you can use pubnet to look for abstracts article summaries of the information in the articles you can usually find a straightforward conclusion at the end of the abstract to summarize the main findings double check findings look at a number of different websites make sure the content isn t word for word which could mean the information was copied and pasted from one site check with your physician or another health care professional call alternative practitioners ask what they think about one therapy or another the practitioner is ethically obligated to be honest and truthful about any therapy be skeptical question everything especially when a practitioner claims to have a cure revolutionary discovery or ancient secrets the practitioner should not give you a guarantee or limited offer this should warn you not to trust the practitioner you should also remember that because something is seen as natural it doesn t make it safe many plants contain poison or cause unwanted effects consider talking with several alternative practitioners like medical herbalists naturopaths and others to gauge the safety of natural products understand that sometimes physicians and scientists try to use simplistic terms to educate inform and empower people since it s difficult to explain complex medical terms these simple terms shouldn t be confused with with sales attempts research side effects of dietary supplements or herbal products many herbal products or supplements can interact with current diet or medication use just because something is described as being alternative or natural this does not mean it s safe if you are prescribed alternative dietary or herbal products get a list of all the ingredients that are in it you may want to consult with your physician or pharmacist regarding the ingredients and how they may interact with your current medication use ask about the practitioner s training since alternative medicine practitioners aren t required to complete standardized training and because laws and regulations can vary greatly from place to place you should ask about the practitioner s training and experience for example you might ask where did you train and how much training did you receive how much hands on experience do you have do you have formal training or certification was your training done online or at a physical campus find out about the practitioner s formal education ask what education the practitioner has most naturopaths and chiropractors have doctorates awarded from a brick and mortar school of medicine while this doesn t guarantee competence it does show that the individual completed requirements and trained with licensed professionals 11 x research source the level of education and certification may vary depending on the alternative medicine for example some require doctoral degrees in alternative medicine or a master s degree in nutrition talk with the practitioner about your health concerns if you have a chronic condition or specific health concern ask the practitioner what experience the practitioner has with it 12 x research source you might find out what approaches were taken and how successful the patient found the treatment be wary if a practitioner promises to cure your condition especially if the practitioner can t give you any solid evidence to support this claim instead look for someone who can heal or treat your health condition choose an alternative medicine provider ask your doctor or local medical school to refer reputable alternative medicine practitioners once you ve determined which alternative medicine you d like to use find a provider who is willing to work with your current healthcare team you should also inform your other healthcare providers that you re working with an alternative medicine provider 13 x research source you may want to check if your health insurance covers the alternative medicine provider while it s not necessary you will need to know what form of payment the practitioner accepts so that you re prepared for appointments,Health

oils for certain degrees of hydrogenation with a metal as catalyst this processing trick slows their natural reaction with oxygen preventing the natural rancid smells and tastes that you d normally experience with foods going off as well as increasing the lifespan of any food made with the fats this process keeps the fats more solid at room temperature adding a deceptively fresh and creamy appeal to the food unfortunately the trans fats are very unhealthy and contribute to inflammation 2 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to

research source chiropractic medicine massage therapy alternative forms of body work learn more about alternative exercise programs exercise programs such as tai chi are gaining popularity especially among baby boomers due to the fact that it combines body movements while minimizing stresses on the joints tai chi is an ancient chinese exercise and martial art however the art form combines breathing exercises and meditation along with the physical movements 5 x research source avoid relying on anecdotal evidence while anecdotal evidence may interest you in alternative medicines you shouldn t rely on it as a trusted form of evidence there are many variables that might be contributing to what works for one person but not for another for example some treatments may work better on someone who s young and healthy or treatment may be less effective for someone with a certain genetic background for example you might hear someone say my friend tried this and it worked for her this anecdotal statement is not backed up by actual evidence look for scientific or clinical studies clinical or scientific evidence follows the scientific method and controls for as many variables as possible the goal with these studies is to determine what medicines work and under what conditions realize that sometimes it s difficult to control all variables especially in clinical human research studies a placebo controlled double blinded study is considered to be the best form of clinical evidence 6 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source with this type of study some of the subjects get sugar pills placebos while other subjects get the treatment being studied neither the doctors nor the patients know which treatment they re getting try to find high quality studies most approaches to alternative medicine aren t tested by good scientific research this can make it difficult to find good studies especially since not much funding is available for alternative medicine research this is largely because many scientific studies are funded by drug companies who wouldn t support alternative medicines also some alternative medicines aren t easily tested using the scientific method for example there s no way to deliver placebo acupuncture other reasons why research is limited include 7 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source 8 x research source different perspectives for example tcm has significantly different perspectives on how organs function and diseases are caused these often don t match western models of disease difficulty patenting substances herbs and other natural substances often used in alternative medicine can t be patented so it doesn t offer a financial incentive to study them interest many scientists aren t committed to researching alternative medicines read peer reviewed journals ask your doctor nurse or healthcare professional to recommend high quality journals the articles about alternative medicine should be peer reviewed this means that they were sent to independent experts for comment and criticism you should also look for impact factor if this shows how widely read cited and respected a journal is 9 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source try to look for evidence from larger studies that have been repeated you might read meta analyses these are papers that look at a group of studies on the same topic and analyse the data as a larger group than could be done for a single study go to the nccih website at nccih nih gov health this page provides information on what science is saying about current complementary practices in addition to providing resources to current objective sources of information watch for signs of misleading information it s easy to misinterpret studies because you want to believe their claims or maybe misinformation is all you can find because websites have copied and pasted inaccurate information to check for misinformation or misinterpretation 10 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source check the date if the information is older it may have changed for example there may be more evidence or older evidence may no longer be true check for validation see if the website has been checked for reliability by an organization like the health on the net hon foundation check the original references if you can you can use pubnet to look for abstracts article summaries of the information in the articles you can usually find a straightforward conclusion at the end of the abstract to summarize the main findings double check findings look at a number of different websites make sure the content isn t word for word which could mean the information was copied and pasted from one site check with your physician or another health care professional call alternative practitioners ask what they think about one therapy or another the practitioner is ethically obligated to be honest and truthful about any therapy be skeptical question everything especially when a practitioner claims to have a cure revolutionary discovery or ancient secrets the practitioner should not give you a guarantee or limited offer this should warn you not to trust the practitioner you should also remember that because something is seen as natural it doesn t make it safe many plants contain poison or cause unwanted effects consider talking with several alternative practitioners like medical herbalists naturopaths and others to gauge the safety of natural products understand that sometimes physicians and scientists try to use simplistic terms to educate inform and empower people since it s difficult to explain complex medical terms these simple terms shouldn t be confused with with sales attempts research side effects of dietary supplements or herbal products many herbal products or supplements can interact with current diet or medication use just because something is described as being alternative or natural this does not mean it s safe if you are prescribed alternative dietary or herbal products get a list of all the ingredients that are in it you may want to consult with your physician or pharmacist regarding the ingredients and how they may interact with your current medication use ask about the practitioner s training since alternative medicine practitioners aren t required to complete standardized training and because laws and regulations can vary greatly from place to place you should ask about the practitioner s training and experience for example you might ask where did you train and how much training did you receive how much hands on experience do you have do you have formal training or certification was your training done online or at a physical campus find out about the practitioner s formal education ask what education the practitioner has most naturopaths and chiropractors have doctorates awarded from a brick and mortar school of medicine while this doesn t guarantee competence it does show that the individual completed requirements and trained with licensed professionals 11 x research source the level of education and certification may vary depending on the alternative medicine for example some require doctoral degrees in alternative medicine or a master s degree in nutrition talk with the practitioner about your health concerns if you have a chronic condition or specific health concern ask the practitioner what experience the practitioner has with it 12 x research source you might find out what approaches were taken and how successful the patient found the treatment be wary if a practitioner promises to cure your condition especially if the practitioner can t give you any solid evidence to support this claim instead look for someone who can heal or treat your health condition choose an alternative medicine provider ask your doctor or local medical school to refer reputable alternative medicine practitioners once you ve determined which

how to make perfume with essential oils,making perfume with essential oils is very easy and can be done with just a few oils you can create your own unique signature fragrance for personal use or to give to a friend visit one of your local stores to try out some essential oils and see what scents you like the best by making your own perfume you control the ingredients and the quality of your fragrance product,learn the order of oils when making perfume from essential oils you ll need to follow an order you start with a base oil then have the middle tones then finally the top notes the top note is what you smell when you first smell your perfume and then you are gradually able to smell your others you ll need to add oils in this order 1 x research source the top notes reach our senses first but dissipate quickly the middle notes are essentially the heart of your fragrance they add warmth and fullness to your perfume and their smell is what lingers base notes evolve over time so you may not smell them at first however after all other smells have faded the base notes remain they are often a more invigorating scent like pine musk glove cedar wood sandalwood etc use a dark colored bottle this is important because a dark bottle will help preserve your fragrance by keeping the light out make sure you shake your perfume before you apply it so that the scents mix together when storing your bottle try to keep it out of direct sunlight you can also use a roller bottle for essential oils these sometimes work better because the fragrance tends to be thicker than regular perfume making it somewhat harder to spritz onto your skin allow the scents to meld although you can use your perfume right away it s best to allow the scents to combine and fuse together before using them you can choose to use your perfume right away but the scent will be less fragrant and the individual oils will not have had as much time to combine into one lovely scent that s why allowing it to sit for a while is helpful because then you ve allowed your perfume time to reach its final scent 2 x research source a perfume made out of essential oils may smell great right away but overtime the scents may combine to something that doesn t smell very appealing allowing your perfume to sit will give you a better idea of what your combined scents will smell like for the majority of the perfume s life know the benefits of essential oil while regular perfumes may last longer on your skin essential oils are great because they are derived directly from nature they don t have the many chemicals

essential oils 3 x research source essential oils are also good for people with sensitive skin or who react negatively to perfume products these oils are natural so you can create a variety of different smells that your skin will hopefully handle better than commercial perfumes commercial perfumes have preservatives and other chemicals which help the scent and fragrance last longer essential oils because they are derived from nature will fade faster however you can add a drop or two of a natural fixative or extender if you want your fragrance to last longer these are usually very pungent so you don t want to use them frequently or in large amounts but one drop here and there won t hurt add your base note the first step to creating your fragrance is adding your base note often times base notes are earthy scents that provide a good lasting smell for your perfume and can be five to 20 percent of your blend but this varies however some people choose to use scents like grape seed oil or sweet almond oil it s your personal preference and you may experiment to see what scents you like if you aren t sure where to start you can follow this guideline 4 x research source for a fresh and energizing perfume add 17 drops of grapefruit oil to your perfume bottle or roller bottle 5 x research source for a romantic and floral blend add 25 drops of rose essential oil for a sensual and earthy fragrance add 20 drops of sweet orange essential oil mix in your middle note this is the heart of your fragrance the smell that appears after your top note has dissipated some people choose to use a more floral scent for this note but once again it is your personal preference often times middle notes are the biggest portion of your blend 50 to 80 percent but once again this varies with experimentation here are some suggestions that follow the previous step 6 x research source for a fresh and energizing perfume add 14 drops of ginger essential oil 7 x research source for a floral and romantic blend add 10 drops of lime essential oil for a sensual earthy fragrance add 15 drops ylang ylang oil ylang ylang is an oil derived from the cananga tree and is known for it s rich floral scent add your top note finally your last main addition to your perfume is the top note which will fade quickly but will be the first scent that you smell when you open up your perfume they can often be five to 20 percent of the blend but you can add more or less if you choose some people prefer to use fruity minty or refreshing scents for their top note try out different scents if you aren t sure and see what you like the best you can also follow this guideline 8 x research source for an energizing fresh blend add 10 drops of vetiver essential oil vetiver is a bunchgrass that is native to india and is often used as a flavoring agent because it creates a thick syrup it also has fixative properties which are what help the fragrance of the perfume to last 9 x research source for a floral romantic perfume add 10 drops of vetiver essential oil for an earthy sensual fragrance add 10 drops of cedar wood essential oil experiment with your scents if you have tried out several different combinations and aren t pleased you may need to just experiment with your scents play with different scents until you find one you like you may prefer a more woodsy scent and want to stick to vanilla sandalwood and sweet almond oil or you may enjoy very floral scents and want to use lavender ylang ylang and grapeseed oil maybe you appreciate fruity scents and want to use lemon sweet orange and mandarin if you have created a great scent thus far and then messed it up with another oil don t fret you can add a drop of orange oil which supposedly helps cancel out other perfumes 10 x research source add alcohol for a preservative this step isn t necessary but can be helpful if you want your scent to last longer depending on the size of bottle you choose will determine how much alcohol to use if you are using 60 or so drops of essential oil you can use three to four ounces of alcohol if you are only using 20 to 30 drops of essential oil you should probably drop the amount of alcohol to one to two ounces 11 x research source you can use any type of alcohol for this but you may want one that blends well with your scents some people choose vodka because it is relatively flavorless but a spiced rum might be nice if you aren t sure start with an alcohol that has less flavoring shake your perfume and use it after you have added all of your ingredients to your fragrance shake it up this will allow the scents to fuse and mingle then if you are patient enough let it sit for about a month before you use it you can use it beforehand but the scents will become stronger as it sits and the alcohol scent will also fade off 12 x research source make a solid perfume you can also create a solid perfume by using beeswax and jojoba oil some people use jojoba oil only for their liquid perfume but if it becomes cold it will harden so it s best to use it if you are going for a solid perfume 13 x research source one recipe you might try is four tablespoons beeswax four tablespoons jojoba 27 32 drops sandalwood oil 27 32 drops vanilla oil 25 30 drops grapefruit oil and 20 25 drops bergamot oil start by grating and melting the beeswax in a boiler over low heat then add the jojoba oil until thoroughly blended allow the mixture to cool below 120 degrees fahrenheit and then proceed to add the rest of the oils store in a small jar or lip balm tube,Health

measuring cup or glass with water that is around room temperature or below your body temperature carefully pour the water into the reservoir or internal tank of your diffuser check for a line or marking on the inside of the tank to indicate how much water you should pour into the tank 3 x research source rather than a line or marker some diffusers may come with a measuring jug that holds

spilling 7 x research source always consult the manufacturer s instructions for advice on your specific diffuser make sure you put the water in before you add any oils add 2 to 4 drops of essential oil to the water unscrew the lid of your chosen oil and tilt it over the water reservoir to begin slowly adding drops let 2 or 3 drops fall into the water before tilting the bottle back and putting the lid back on 8 x research source combine different oils for a more complex aroma but avoid using more than 4 drops of oil combined in a candle diffuser the amount of oil needed will vary based on the size of your room start with fewer drops and increase the amount of oil you use until you re happy with the aroma keep track of how many drops of oil you use for each operation so you can get a

reservoir and light it place a small candle such as a tealight or something similar in the space underneath the reservoir use a match or long lighter to set the candle alight and leave it for 3 to 4 hours to diffuse the oils 9 x research source keep an eye on your candle and diffuser as it works to make sure the candle doesn t go out by itself once the water in the reservoir has mostly evaporated

out new scents easily pick an oil that you like for long term usage there s no right amount of oil to pour into the diffuser some people will pour in the whole bottle others will add a little at a time to keep the oil fresh add the reeds to the diffuser bunch the reeds together and carefully drop them into the mouth of the diffuser spread them out so they are separate and all point in different directions for a more even diffusion of oil the oil will begin absorbing into the reeds and slowly filling your room with the aroma of the oil 12 x research source the more reeds that you use the stronger the aroma will be for a smaller room you may only want to use 2 or 3 reeds adding the reeds may cause the oil in the diffuser to overflow if it s already very full be careful when adding the reeds or do so over a sink to prevent spillage flip the reeds to refresh the oils and the aroma every week or so you may notice that the aroma from the oil begins to fade lift the reeds out of the diffuser and flip them over so the end that was soaking in the oils is now facing upward this should refresh the aroma for another week or so until you flip them again 13 x research source it may help

how to extract oil from fruit peels,essential oils are great for freshening up before heading out for the day bringing a pleasant citrus scent to the home and can be used in a variety of cooking or craft recipes making your own essential oil can be done easily at home with just a few ingredients found around the home,wash the materials this includes your hands and the fruit you will be extracting oil from cold pressing doesn t involve chemicals for extraction so it s important to thoroughly wash the fruit to remove bacteria it takes about 25 pieces of citrus fruit to produce a useful amount of oil this way plan ahead 1 x research source peel the fruit remove the rind of the fruit with a peeler or knife and place it to the side you may also remove the rind of the fruit with your fingers if you desire but this can cause a greater amount of pulp and other fruit material to end up in the oils which will need to be removed later the greatest concentration of oils in most fruit is contained in the outer layer of the rind the lighter portion of the rind contains much less oil 2 x research source you can use an electric peeler to obtain the skin of the fruit but note that this may produce more pulp than a hand peeled method reuse the leftover peels once the fruit is peeled you can use the leftover fruit for cooking or eating there are a variety of uses for the leftover fruit peel even after pressing rather than composting the peel try keeping the peels in a small bag and hanging it somewhere to keep the room smelling zesty the oil in orange peel limonene acts as a repellant for several types of insects toss a few peels into the garbage disposal and give them a good grinding to freshen up the smell of your sink 3 x research source press the fruit peel use a pressing device such as a sieve to squeeze the fruit peel over a jar heavy pressure will squeeze liquid from the peel this liquid contains the oils you re looking for use a fair amount of strength when pressing but take care not to damage or break the implement you are using you should see a small amount of oil drain from the peel after a few seconds cold pressing peel is quite a bit of effort for what looks to be a fairly small amount of oil don t get discouraged the oil is quite potent 4 x research source a garlic press is a great way of pressing small amounts of fruit peel with ease a mortar and pestle may also be used though this method is a little more labor intensive and difficult separate the oils allow the liquid squeezed from the peel to stand for a few days the oil will separate from the rest of the liquid which can then be collected a centrifuge can also be used to separate the oil from the rest of the liquid a simple way of collecting the oil from the liquid is placing the liquid in the freezer the oil will remain in its liquid form while the remainder freezes allowing you to pour out the oil 5 x research source oil extracted this way has a small shelf life try to use any oil created within a 6 month period apply when needed bottle the oil that you extract from the liquid for later use dab a little on your skin for a fresh smell or use some in cooking recipes that require essential oil remember that the oil is very concentrate a little will go a long way peel your fruit and lay the rinds out to dry allow them to air dry until the peels are hard to the touch this can take anywhere from a few days to up to a week so remain patient avoid the use of a dehydrator or other drying mechanisms when drying the peels this can compromise the oil stored in the peels cut the peels into small pieces once the peels are completely dry cut the peels into small pieces you can use a knife vegetable dicer or food processor to accomplish this take care not to over dice or process the peels however as this can compromise the oils contained in the peels over diced peels will take on a liquid minced appearance avoid expressing liquid from the peels prior to the distillation process place the peels in a jar and cover with grain alcohol pour enough alcohol into the jar to completely cover the peels the alcohol should rest roughly an inch above the top of where the peels rest allow the jar to sit for several days vodka can be used for the distilling process but may slightly affect the scent of the oil depending on the type of vodka used place the jar in a location that gets plenty of sunlight to help the separation process shake the jar several times a day give the jar a shake each day to help separate the oil from the peels strain the liquid from the peels after several days have passed use a coffee filter to strain the liquid into a second jar place a coffee filter or cloth over the second jar and allow all of the alcohol in the jar to evaporate this can take up to a week or more 6 x research source oil evaporates much more slowly than water or similar types of liquids though oil can technically evaporate the water will evaporate before the oil leaving just the oil behind apply when needed after the alcohol has evaporated all that will remain is the oil bottle the oil for later use dab a little on your skin for a fresh smell or use some in cooking recipes that require essential oil remember that the oil is very concentrate a little will go a long way always test a small amount on your skin first in case you have a reaction to the peel oil skin sprayed with citrus oil should not be exposed to direct sunlight citrus oil is phototoxic meaning direct sunlight can contribute to sunburn blisters and other harmful skin conditions,Health

you want to use to make oil pick a container that fits all of your flowers with room to spare a see through glass container works well because the sunlight can get into the container and you can easily keep an eye on the mixture while it steeps place the flowers into the glass container the amount of flowers you use varies depending on the size jar you use and how much calendula oil you want to make for example if you are using a pint jar you will want to use no more than a cup and a half of calendula flowers so that there is plenty of room for the oil to cover them all completely this will make between a cup and two cups of calendula oil depending on how much oil you add you do not want to pack the flowers into the container tightly as you want the flowers to be totally encased in oil on the other hand you don t want just a few flowers and a ton of oil this will make a very very weak calendula oil pour the oil into the glass container the goal is to completely cover the calendula petals with the oil keep pouring oil into the container until the flowers are totally covered shaking the jar slightly to get rid of large air bubbles it is a good idea to have at least one inch of oil above the flower petals so that it is assured that they stay covered you can also stir the mixture a little bit to make sure the flowers are covered with oil and that there are no big air bubbles with your spoon finish by pushing all flowers into the oil so they are all submerged there should not be any pieces popping out if there are push them down or add more oil place the container in direct sunlight the mixture needs the slow and steady heat of the sun to really infuse to get the heat it needs you can put it outside or inside depending on where you live usually a south facing window is best this should get a lot of sun during the summer if you live in an area where there are animals that might knock it over or mess with it for some reason put it inside by a window if you can safely put it outside where no one or no animal will take it putting it outside would be better ideally oil making should be done in summer so when the oil is set in a window it heats up if you are making the oil at any other time of year gently heating up the oil and herbs and stewing it for 10 minutes on a very low heat is a good idea this will approximate the heating that the sun does to the mixture leave the mixture for a minimum of two weeks gently shake the mixture daily for a moment or two to mix it up and make sure all the flowers are submerged the mixture needs this time to gently combine if you leave your mixture in the window for more time you will get a stronger oil once you get some practice at making the oil you can decide how long is perfect for your desired strength of oil strain the oil place the oil mixture into a coffee filter a piece of muslin or in cheese cloth over another glass container 9 x research source once strained the macerated oil is now

and make sure they are fair trade meaning the local farmers get fair pay does your essential oil supplier grow and distill its own organically grown herbs are the distillation facilities part of the farm where the herbs are grown so they are freshly distilled maintaining their potency consider the willingness to answer questions does your essential oil supplier provide knowledgeable staff to answer your questions about use and supply as much information as possible free of charge if not or if they are hesitant to answer questions or pushy about making a purchase consider going somewhere

other parts of your body like your back be sure to extend the wrap a few extra inches or cm to make the wrap more versatile choose your filling people use long grained white rice flax seed buckwheat barley oatmeal feed corn cherry pits beans or millet seed if you are making a rice neck wrap make sure you do not use instant rice which may cook when heated add an aromatherapy scent although this is not necessary a relaxing scent can help to relax and remove tension from your body choose an essential oil or spice and mix it with your filling of choice in a large bowl let the filling sit with the scent for a day or so and stir often to make sure the scent is distributed throughout the grain for example you can use approximately 5 drops of an essential oil like lavender peppermint or rose you can also use 5 pinches of spices like cinnamon cloves or rosemary you can also mix with rose or other flower petals cut the fabric to the measurements you just took making sure to leave room for seams if you are using a towel or a sock this will not be necessary if you plan to have an inner and outer fabric cut rectangles out of both the lining and cover material making the lining slightly smaller about 1 2 inch 1 3 cm fold the fabric lengthwise with the inside fabric facing out pin it in place across the open length and both ends so the seams stay together while you sew 3 x research source sew

remaining end leaving approximately a 1 inch 2 54 cm opening at the end of this remaining side if you are sewing an inner and outer bag leave 1 end all the way open on the outer bag you will need to open the outer bag regularly while you heat the inner bag turn the fabric right side out through the 1 inch 2 54 cm opening on the side pour the aromatic grain or beans into the sack or inner sack with a funnel or a measuring cup with a spout experiment with the amount most neck wraps are 1 2 to 3 4 full do not fill it all the way as the less full it is the more it will conform to your body sew up the remaining seam tightly with a needle and thread or a zipper foot on your sewing machine although this 1 inch 2 54 cm of the seam will face out it is important to be able to rip this seam out and replace the grain if the bag loses its scent or gets wet if you are making an outer bag hem the 2 sides of the outer bag in and adhere velcro to each side so that you can open and close it easily heat your bag or inner bag in the microwave for 90 seconds if you do not feel it is warm enough heat in 30 second intervals place around your neck and over your shoulders until the neck wrap cools approximately 20 minutes wash the fabric and replace the filler on your neck warmer every 3 to 6 months depending upon the heaviness of use if you really want to get fancy make the pillow and then make a cover for it that can be easily washed yet removed during the microwaving process just remember to make the cover measurements slightly larger in order to accommodate the inner pillow this makes an excellent gift good luck use a woolen baby s blanket alternatively cut down a wool blanket to a smaller size this is a useful repurposing for blankets that are nearing the end of their days it must be one hundred percent wool as this won t catch fire easily spray the wool blanket with water so it is a little bit misty pop it in the microwave or dryer for a little bit to heat it up wrap

regular breathing by lining it up with yours you should be specific breathe in deeply now filling your chest and lungs as you breath in as well followed by an exhalation and the words slowly let the

focus their gaze on a fixed point it can be your forehead if you re right in front of them or a dimly lit object in the room tell them to choose an object any object and rest their eyes on it this is where the stereotype of the dangling watch comes from as this small object is actually not a terrible thing for someone to look it if they feel relaxed enough to close their eyes let them pay attention to their eyes from time to time if they seem like they are darting around give them some guidance i want you to pay attention to that poster on the wall or try and focus on the space right

won t be happy hypnosis however has many therapeutic benefits outside of a cheesy las vegas show help your subject relax and let go of their problems or worries instead of trying to play a practical joke even well intentioned suggestions can have bad results if you don t know what you are doing this is why licensed hypnotherapists usually help the patient determine the right course of action instead of trying to give it to them as a suggestion use basic hypnosis lower anxiety levels hypnosis reduces anxiety no matter what your suggestions are so don t feel like you need to fix anyone simply putting someone in a trance state is a fantastic way to lower stress levels and anxiety the act of deep relaxation without trying to solve anything is so rare in daily life that it can put problems and worries in perspective all by itself 9 x research source ask them to envision solutions to possible problems instead of telling someone how to fix an issue have them imagine themselves already succeeding what does success look and feel like to them how did they get there what is their preferred future what has changed to get them there know that hypnosis can be used for a variety of

that hypnosis is only a small part of any mental health solution the key benefits of hypnosis are relaxation and time to muse safely on an issue it is both deep relaxation and focused attention on an issue at the same time however hypnosis is not a miracle cure or quick fix it is simply a way to help people dive deeper into their own mind this sort of self reflection is critical to strong mental health but serious or chronic issues should always be treated by a trained and certified professional 11 x research source slowly take them out of their trance state you don t want to jerk them out of their relaxation let them know that they are becoming more aware of their surroundings tell them that they will come back to full awareness alert and awake after you count to five if you feel like

five you will be feeling wide awake fully alert and completely refreshed discuss the hypnosis with the partner to see help you improve in the future ask them what felt right to them what threatened to take them out of hypnosis and what they felt this will help you get people under more effectively next time and help them learn what they enjoyed about the process don t pressure anyone to talk immediately simply open a conversation and wait to talk until later if they seem relaxed and want some time to stay quiet prepare for commonly asked questions in the future it s good to have a general idea about how to answer questions like these ahead of time because confidence and trust are so important in determining how a person is going to respond to your induction common questions you might get at any point in the process include 13 x research source gibbons d e 2001 i experience as an art form hypnosis hyperempiria and the best me technique i new york ny authors choice press what are you going to do i will ask you to visualize some pleasant scenes while i talk about how to use your own mental abilities more effectively you can always refuse to do anything that you don t want to do and you can always come out of the experience yourself if an emergency should come up what does it feel like to be in hypnosis most of us experience changes in our conscious awareness several times a day without realizing it any time you let your imagination go and just flow along with a piece of music or a verse of poetry or get so involved in watching a movie or a television drama that you feel like you re part of the action instead of a part of the audience you are experiencing a form of trance hypnosis is just a way of helping you to focus and define these changes in consciousness in order to use your mental abilities more effectively is it safe hypnosis is not an altered state of consciousness as sleep is for example but an altered experience of consciousness you will never do something you don t want to do or be forced into thoughts against your will if it s all just your imagination then what good is it don t be confused by the tendency in english and many other languages to use the word imaginary as opposite in meaning to the word real and neither should it be confused with the term image the imagination is a very real group of mental abilities whose potential we are just now beginning to explore and which extends far beyond our ability to form mental images can you make me do anything i don t want to do when you re using hypnosis you still have your own personality and you re still you so you won t say or do anything that you wouldn t do in the very same situation without hypnosis and you can easily refuse any suggestion that you don t want to accept that s why we call them suggestions what can i do in order to respond better hypnosis is very similar to letting yourself become absorbed in watching a sunset or the embers of a campfire letting yourself flow with a piece of music or poetry or feeling like you are part of the action instead of part of the audience when you are watching a movie it all depends on your ability and willingness to go along with the instructions and suggestions that are provided what if i enjoy it so much that i don t want to come back hypnotic suggestions are basically an exercise for the mind and the imagination just like a movie script is but you still come back to everyday life when the session is over just like you come back at the end of a movie however the hypnotist might need to try a couple times to pull you out it is enjoyable being completely relaxed but you can t do much when hypnotized what if it doesn t work did you ever become so absorbed in your play as a child that you didn t hear your mother s voice calling you in for dinner or are you one of the many people who are able to wake up at a certain time each morning just by deciding the night before that you are going to do so we all have the ability to use our minds in ways we are not usually aware of and some of us have developed these abilities more than others if you just allow your thoughts to respond freely and naturally to the words and images as your guide you ll be able to go wherever your mind can take you,Health

move onto more meaningful visions imagine your bills blowing away in the breeze imagine you running off those pounds get as detailed as possible always think of your five senses appreciate the fact that you are now extremely relaxed imagine you are at the top of a flight of 10 stairs which at the fifth step start to submerge into water picture every detail of this scene from the top to the bottom tell yourself that you are going to descend the stairs counting each step down starting at 10 picture each number in your mind imagine that each number you count is further down and one step closer to the bottom after each number you will feel yourself drifting further and further into deep relaxation 6 x research source as you take each step imagine the feel of the step under your feet

feel like you re spinning if you do not feel as stated above try again slower with a will to grasp what is happening once you have achieved this state you should proceed to address your problems and decide upon what it is you want from where you are now start to narrate what you are doing speak in the present and future tense quietly to yourself or as if you are reading it from a page start to picture three boxes under the water that you have to swim to get to once you have found the boxes open them slowly one at a time and narrate to yourself what is happening when you open the box for example as i open the box i feel a radiant light engulf me i feel it becoming a part of me this light is my new found confidence that i can never lose as it is now a part of me and then proceed on to the next box you should avoid using statements with a negative connotation such as i don t want to be tired and irritable instead say i am becoming calm and relaxed examples of positive statements include i am strong and slender i am successful and positive and if you have pain my back is beginning to feel wonderful see warning on pain repeat your statement s to yourself as many times as you wish feel free to wander about the water visualizing yourself emptying boxes finding treasure in the form of self confidence money etc or simply letting all your tensions disappear find areas where the water is cold hot or full of wildlife let your imagination go get ready to exit your hypnotic state with each step you take feel the water becoming lower and lower until you have once again reached that fifth step once you are out of the water and are on the sixth step you may start to feel heavy or as if there is a weight on your chest merely wait on the step until this passes

need proof you re in a trance there are exercises you can do anything that can be seen or felt in your body can work try these ideas on for size entwine your fingers together keep them together

staring contest with someone else to test your ability having full command over your eye movements will help you maintain steady eye contact with the other person during the hypnosis practice your ability to focus with your eyes do this by looking at a close object like a pen or pencil and then a distant object in the room hold the pencil close to your face focus on the pencil move from focusing on the pencil to an object that is further away like a picture on the wall or a doorknob return to focusing on the pencil then focus on the distant object continue practicing this to improve your focus flexibility improve your peripheral awareness this is your ability to see objects and movements on either side of you without having to turn your head to improve this ability 1 x research

suggestions are you feel your fingers tingling and you will cluck like a chicken when i snap my fingers master indirect suggestions for more conversation based hypnosis indirect suggestions involve a lot of metaphors and story telling the process is a lot more drawn out than direct suggestions you need to build a rapport with the other person defusing their conscious attention to catch their

you may be able to get certified through a week of classes this means you know the technique but you still need to get real world experience in order to perfect it gain the other person s attention with a story or task before you can put someone in a hypnotic trance you need to get their attention find a way to engage them many hypnotherapists do this through conversation or by having the subject look at an image another easy way to do this is by asking someone to close their eyes 12 x expert source stephanie riseley mfa certified hypnotherapist expert interview 28 april 2020 for example a way to do an induction which is bringing someone into a quick trance is to make them focus on their palm you bring their palm up in front of them then move their hand towards them as they stare at it people go into trance like states every day you do this when you re meditating focused on your favorite song or when you don t remember driving home reach the person s unconscious mind with a story your unconscious mind is the part you don t control and it becomes accessible once your conscious focus is distracted many practitioners do this by telling a story with a lot of powerful images and descriptions your goal is to get your subject to relax tuning into the story so they fall into a trance 13 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source for example start out by saying close your eyes and relax as you relax imagine yourself on a calm beach your muscles become loose as you relax words like relax and imagine are considered powerful words that conjure up strong images to engage your subject s conscious focus keep the images relatively vague to so the other person stays focused on the image they probably aren t imagining a fiery pink beach so the image draws them out of the trance state watch for your subject s body to relax monitor your subject for some subtle cues showing they are in a relaxed state many people stop fidgeting and their breathing slows down look for their pupils to dilate or their muscles to grow limp 14 x research source if you re hypnotising yourself notice when you feel loose and relaxed your breathing will feel slow and steady as well getting someone into a relaxed state isn t always easy or foolproof some people are less suggestible than others keep trying to capture their attention or work quickly if they re in a semi relaxed state direct the person s behavior by describing a meaningful scene this is when hypnotists suggest ways for their subjects to act the easiest way to establish a suggestion is by continuing the scene you created while bringing the person into a trance pick a behavior you want them to learn then repeat it a few times as you describe the scene 15 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source for example say focus on my voice as you relax into the trance imagine an enjoyable day at the beach as you relax you notice the color of the water relax more deeply as you feel the sand between your toes you relax and feel more optimistic the scene needs to be meaningful to the subject for instance describe gaming or gardening if those are relevant interests a beach scene isn t helpful if you never go to the beach tell the subject to move again so they exit the trance end the trance with a final command try counting to 3 instructing the subject to open their eyes once you reach 3 before you begin counting tell them they will feel relaxed and revitalized when they open their eyes then end the trance and see the results yourself 16 x research source other ways to break trances include telling someone to open their eyes move parts of their body or suggesting that waking up is safe and their body feels completely normal counting and open your eyes also works for bringing yourself out of a self induced trance work in a quiet environment to eliminate distractions no matter who you re hypnotising a successful session depends on capturing the subject s attention distractions draw focus away from you when someone focuses on a loud noise or moving they aren t listening to you speak and will be less likely to reach a trance state 17 x expert source stephanie riseley mfa certified hypnotherapist expert interview 28 april 2020 this applies to self hypnosis as well you re going to have a hard time reaching a relaxed state with the tv on your phone buzzing and the dogs barking street or stage hypnotists create a quiet atmosphere by drawing eyes to themselves with practice they learn how to do this even in public for example the hypnotist may describe a beautiful scene or have you do a simple task like join your hands together ask for permission before hypnotizing others hypnotism must only be performed on willing participants for hypnotherapists consent also involves discovering what a client needs to gain from the session then you tailor your session to suit the client s needs for example some common goals for hypnotherapy are quitting smoking gaining confidence and achieving goals with performance hypnotism you need consent but you don t need to spend time discussing the session your goal is to get someone to do something like lock their hands together not work through deep personal issues speak in a strong voice with confidence hypnotism is all about convincing people if you don t sound convincing do not expect someone else to believe what you re saying describe scenes with clear crisp language and offer suggestions with authority 18 x research source for example when using a direct suggestion you say you will feel happy and positive when you wake up master keywords that make hypnotic suggestions effective read up about hypnotic language and find words to adapt in your practice in particular look for power words or hot words that pack plenty of emotion by bringing up strong emotions in a subject you engage their unconscious mind more leading to more effective hypnotism 19 x research source some powerful words are imagine you and because when you re describing a scene to draw a subject s focus use these words to make the image more vivid choose words that pack a descriptive punch phrases like beautiful lake and strong mountain are a few examples keep them vague so you don t interrupt trance states simplify your practice for speedy public performances street and stage hypnotists need to get audience members into a trance very quickly after you master the basic techniques work on simplifying them to move quickly from inducing a trance state to suggesting an action and ending the trance performers often are in environments with lots of distractions so dragging out the hypnotism increases the likelihood of it being unsuccessful they perform hypnotisms in 60 seconds or less for quick hypnotism approach the other person with energy use concise sentences to induce the trance deepen it then provide the hypnotic suggestion before ending it,Health

how to use rapid hypnosis,after hundreds of years of neglect science is finally giving some attention to hypnosis and concluding that it does in fact work if not quite the way people have claimed in the past 1 x research source it won t give you control over the person you ve hypnotized but it will put him or her in a calmer more focused state of mind in which extraneous memories and thoughts are often blocked out 2 x research source it can be an effective way to reduce stress and pain 3 x research source inducing hypnosis quickly is often best because it permits less time for distractions,practice speaking in a soothing tone it s imperative that you talk to your subject in a way that calms and relaxes him or her practice speaking slowly with some rhythm and melody and no harsh or discordant tones use this as an opportunity to practice your script if you struggle with what you want to say during induction it will break the subject s focus 4 x research source you also should not sound like you re reading off a script practice will help you sound natural prepare your subject mentally and physically you will want to make sure that he or she is relaxed inform him or her that you might touch him or her lightly so that he or she is not surprised in a way that would cause him or her to break focus if your subject is wearing a skirt give her a blanket to put over her legs so that she does not need to worry about the way she positions herself similarly tell your subject that is okay if he or she coughs or moves if he or she is struggling to suppress a biological function it will likely break his focus 5 x research source similarly tell him or her to keep his or her legs uncrossed otherwise he or she might get caught up by repositioning his or her legs if he or she is wearing glasses have him or her remove them tell your subject that he or she has nothing to worry about a distinct sense of fear will prevent him from falling into hypnosis you want to let him know what you will not be able to manipulate them and that he will not be endangered by the hypnosis simply indicate this is a perfectly safe procedure you will enter into a state of increased relaxation and focus but you will be in control the entire time ask for permission always begin by asking if he or she is ready to be hypnotized establishing consent is important for ensuring that he or she is mentally ready and should calm him or her as well 6 x research source when asking for consent ask the subject about any mental or emotional conditions that might affect their stability under hypnosis you should only perform hypnosis on someone who is stable 7 x expert source stephanie riseley mfa certified hypnotherapist expert interview 28 april 2020 a simple do you agree to be hypnotized should be sufficient beware that not all people respond the same way hypnotic subjects need to be willing to engage in the procedure and psychologically susceptible studies have shown that approximately 80 of subjects are moderately susceptible 10 are highly susceptible and another 10 have low susceptibility 8 x research source susceptibility is positively correlated to how well the subject is prone to fantasy and empathy 9 x research source his or her ability to focus while for example reading also correlates to susceptibility 10 x research source it is often thought that hypnosis is easier in a relaxing environment with few external sounds or distractions 11 x expert source stephanie riseley mfa certified hypnotherapist expert interview 28 april 2020 while this sort of hypnosis certainly won t hurt some studies indicate that hypnosis is equally as easy to reach in disturbing settings tell the subject to press my hand stretch one of your hands out in front of the subject and ask him or her to press his or her hand against yours ideally he or she should press down with some force but only be touching the edge of your hand so that it will be easy for you to withdraw your hand when you are ready 12 x research source tell the subject to close your eyes as you do this take your other hand and wave it across his or her face do this very rapidly shortly after having him or her press against your hand that way his attention will be occupied with two tasks simultaneously 13 x research source tell the subject to sleep as you do this pull your hand away from his so that he falls forward as if falling asleep like you told him to the goal is to surprise him 14 x research source you should speak in a strong authoritative tone when telling him to sleep 15 x research source this whole process should take about four seconds surprise and thus speed is imperative be prepared to urge the subject into a deeper hypnosis the initial shock of the eight word induction will fade if not followed up with a script that takes him into a deeper state of hypnosis for this follow up in a calm tone with a couple of sentences asking the subject to fall into a deeper sleep 16 x research source the two best ways to deepen the hypnosis are described below rocking the head and performing a countdown pick whichever you are most comfortable with rocking the head will require some physical contact with the subject rock the subject s head if the subject is positioned so that he falls over into a slump after you pull away his hand some hypnotists will begin to rock the subjects head with their hands to induce a more relaxed state as you do that you can tell him to let his neck relax and let that feeling of relaxation spread throughout his body tell him to let his mind and body relax until he falls into a deep sleep tell him for example as i rock your head you will go deeper and deeper into a trance the more i rock your head the deeper you go the deeper you go the better you feel the better you feel the deeper you go 17 x research source try a countdown tell him that he will become more relaxed as you count down from 1 to 5 every time you count down a number describe to him how he is felling 1 the relaxation is spreading through your body 2 the relaxation is getting deeper 3 your mind is becoming relaxed 4 you no longer feel anything but the sense of relaxation 5 your relaxation is getting deeper with every passing second 18 x research source alternatively try something like 10 you feel yourself relaxing 9 going deeper and deeper 8 doing excellently keep going 7 with each number i say you will be in a deeper trance 6 deeper excellent 5 farther and farther relax completely now 4 3 you re doing well 2 even farther away from the world 1 0 you are now in a deep trance begin priming your subject to wake shortly before you try to awake him tell him that it is almost time to wake up and become more aware to make the transition peaceful indicate how he will feel when he comes out of hypnosis tell him that when he comes out of the trance he will feel relaxed and comfortable as you do this use cues that will make him feel like he is returning to the real world stop speaking in such a slow soothing tone and begin talking in a more normal conversational tone like you would in everyday life call the subject by his name to remind him of his regular life 19 x research source wake the subject tell him that he will awaken after you count down from 10 as you count down talk in a progressively less calming tone say something like 10 you are feeling more awake 9 you are beginning to become conscious 8 you are remembering your life 7 6 you feel like you are waking from a deep sleep,Health
how to perform hypnosis,hypnosis can be a great way to help someone relax a fun fetish to incorporate into your sex life or even just an entertaining pastime this article will focus on how to get someone into a hypnotic trance followed by a few suggestions for things to try and finally how to bring someone safely out of trance what you do beyond that is up to you and only limited by your imagination,help your subject get ready the first thing you need to do before you even begin hypnosis is to make sure your subject is relaxed and comfortable it is also important to know what you plan to do and to discuss with your subject what they d like to experience almost anyone can be hypnotized but it requires the right frame of mind a willingness to try it and the right environment have your subject lie down on a bed or couch or sit in a comfortable chair make sure if they are sitting up that whatever they re sitting in will be able to prevent them from falling over if they slump or lean for the most part the body will keep itself upright enough to prevent falling but it s a good precaution to take make sure your subject is not thirsty or hungry and does not have to go to the bathroom eliminate distracting noises you may want to play some quiet soothing music also try to lower the chance of distractions if there are other people around ask them not to disturb you and don t forget to make sure pets cannot come in the room and interrupt your session finally to help your subject relax encourage them to begin breathing slowly and deeply begin the induction induction is a term used to describe the process of bringing someone down into a hypnotic trance there are many types of induction and it may take a little trial and error to figure out which one works best for you and your subject each subject may have a different preferred induction or one that works better for them so it s best to learn a few different techniques to try out you can look up many sample hypnosis scripts online by searching for sample hypnosis induction scripts some classic techniques include 1 x research source progressive relaxation this is where you talk your subject through relaxing every part of their body either by outright instructing them to do so with each body part or by describing a flowing warmth creeping up or down their body or by having them squeeze and relax each body part in turn it is customary to start at the head or feet and move up or down the body slowly part by part difficult subjects may require the body to be broken up into smaller parts such as toes feet heels ankles and so on whereas more easily relaxed subjects may be able to settle down with larger parts like feet legs etc progressive relaxation is often used as the first part of a longer induction counting the more difficult your subject the longer you will need to count for slowly count up from 1 pausing between each number you can inject calming phrases between each number such as 1 you are becoming more relaxed 2 you feel calmer and safer 3 you are growing pleasantly warm you can also have your subject repeat each number back to you this can be a good way to gauge how relaxed or entranced your subject is becoming as their voice grows quieter and quieter or they respond more slowly or not at all ericksonian pattern this is a technique that focuses more on a conversational tone you discuss in a calm smooth voice with your subject what they are going to experience how they are feeling what they are noticing and so on you can include suggestions in this such as and are you noticing that your body is growing more still and beginning to feel warmer leading questions such as this can be very useful ericksonian hypnosis is almost a thing all its own so if you are going to use ericksonian techniques it is a good idea to research them first 2 x research source soft suggestions such as i see that you are becoming more relaxed or you can begin to notice that your eyes are tending to close can work well on difficult subjects who have a hard time relaxing on their own hard suggestions such as you are feeling sleepy or your body is relaxed and your eyelids are heavy can work on more easily hypnotized subjects but can also cause the mind to want to rebel and fight against the suggestions so use them with caution for experienced subjects who have been entranced a few times before or more you can try doing an induction by reminding them that they ve done this before and suggesting that becoming entranced is easier and easier every time they do it in some cases you can basically cause your experienced subject to induct themselves simply by guiding them to think about what being in trance feels like as a final note on induction it is common to suggest or lead the subject into closing their eyes to increase the depth of the trance it is possible to enter a deep trance with the eyes open but most people tend towards closing their eyes as they relax anyway so calling attention to it can help them feel that they are becoming more entranced deepen the trance once you have completed your induction your subject may not yet be fully entranced or they may only be in a light trance using a second induction technique to help them go deeper can be very useful slowing and deepening your voice can help impress upon them that things are slowing down and it is time to settle further into trance at this point it is best not to use any induction techniques that would require them to answer questions or give any complex responses some people can remain in a deep trance while still speaking normally but many people have a harder time speaking clearly or at length when in trance so asking them a question that requires a thoughtful or lengthy response can cause them to wake up a little in order to be able to answer 3 x research source you can try other techniques to deepen their trance such as asking them to lift a hand or finger and calling attention to how heavy their body is and how difficult the task is or if they have no problem lifting it you can call attention to how their body feels light and floaty so it s easy for them to lift a hand or finger and suggest that perhaps it seems to lift itself without them having to think much about it you can also just keep repeating phrases such as the deeper you go the deeper you go or down down down we go if you want a very very deep trance you can ask them to become so entranced or sleepy that they enter a place in their mind where they will not remember what you have talked about or where they feel they are almost about to fall completely asleep these are only recommended for experienced subjects provide the consensual suggestions at this point you are ready to begin giving suggestions and doing whatever it was you wanted to hypnotize your subject for please note that hypnosis is entirely a consensual act subjects simply will not act on suggestions that they don t feel comfortable acting on you cannot force your subject to do anything they aren t comfortable doing attempting to do so may cause them to wake up abruptly which can be upsetting if you are unsure if your subject would be willing to respond to your ideas try framing them as light suggestions using phrases such as would you like to or do you think you could or if it would feel good some subjects respond better to firm instructions but nearly all subjects will be able to respond at least somewhat to light suggestions some examples of suggestions or ideas for your subject 4 x research source implanting post hypnotic triggers these can be as simple as a quick induction trigger whenever i snap my fingers if it is safe for you to do so you will fall into a light trance or more complex such as a happy button whenever you see a red light you will instantly feel happy warm and good or even lifestyle altering suggestions if that is what your subject wants whenever you start to smoke a cigarette you will feel disgusted by the taste of the cigarette and immediately want to put it out in trance emotional effects simply telling or suggesting to your subject that they will feel happy warm de stressed amused loved safe or some other positive emotion can induce that feeling in them sometimes very strongly a good hypnotist never elicits negative emotions from their subject unless their subject has explicitly asked for that and even then only experienced hypnotists should attempt this therapeutic venting if your subject is someone who can speak normally or audibly during trance you can encourage them to talk about how they are feeling things they are planning or dreaming about what s going on in their life or any other helpful topic you d like to hear about subjects who can speak in trance will often have lowered inhibitions and be willing to discuss things they would normally keep private so make sure you respect their privacy and do not share what they have said unless they tell you while awake and not in trance that it is okay for you to do so this technique can be very cathartic for your subject but be prepared to deal with upset feelings if they talk about something that is hard for them guided imagery a pleasant experience for a subject can include the hypnotist taking them on a fantastic spiritual or otherwise meaningful adventure in their minds or even just a pleasant scenario to try out make up a story and describe all the senses being experienced in great detail how things look how they sound what they smell like how they feel you can also make room for your subject to fill in details themselves such as by saying you come to a beautiful clearing and someone or something wonderful is there to greet you picture in your mind what they look like how they sound how they smell if you were to touch them what would they feel like you don t need to answer me out loud unless you want to just simply experience this meeting and allow it to happen however it wants to happen make sure you keep your imagery positive and pleasant as your subject s mind will be much more willing to fully experience the guided journey than it would be while they were awake and introducing frightening sad or upsetting ideas can be devastating for the subject s hypnotic experience and may even cause them to suddenly awaken which can also be harmful to their emotions and experience wake your subject once you have finished with all the work you want to do while your subject is in trance or when you notice them starting to awaken of their own accord you can begin to

how to play tricks using hypnosis techniques,hypnosis clinically referred to sometimes as hypnotherapy and or hypnotic suggestion is when one party places the subject into a trance like state usually resulting in increased focus and concentration being able to hypnotize people can see a number of practical experiments accomplished but these techniques are also used for therapeutic effects as with any situation where you are dealing with human subjects or potential medical issues you should consult a physician before proceeding 1 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source 2 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source,use a relaxation technique there are a number of ways to start off a session of analytical therapy also known as imagination therapy but getting the subject into a receptive state is essential 3 x research source 4 x research source try having them lay on a comfortable couch sofa and close their eyes they are not to go to sleep at any point use a soft relaxing tone at all times when speaking to the subject you can attempt to have them count down slowly from 100 for more tense patients you can have them intentionally and systematically tense hold and then release each of their muscles controlled breathing also can work the subject places their hands on their chest and belly sometimes the hypnotist can do this part while the subject breathes slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth target the visuals you want to use once your subject is in a receptive state you need to narrow the sets of imagery you focus on 5 x research source you can try some interesting experiments as long as you are careful select positive images like a holiday party a graduation a wedding or a combination of multiple images in sequence to draw a correspondingly positive response out of the subject if they need to relax you may help them construct the images out of features the subject associates with positive emotions and memories if you are helping a case of trauma you may have them search for pleasant images to supplant horrific ones choose how you want these visuals expressed there is a great deal of flexibility here so this needs to be tailored to your subject s needs and perhaps discussed before the session 6 x research source with so much range you can make the mode of expression part of the experiment maybe having your subject drive their images around in a vehicle or make a movie of their happiest memories would be something you can attempt perhaps having the subject going on an adventure within their own images could be quite an experience to try find a creative way to discard negative images in a symbolic way that allows the positive images to remain in place consider something literal like tossing the bad images in a trash can or projecting them on a screen so there is room in the mind for the pleasant imagery talk your subject through the process your subject is in a receptive state but not asleep you are guiding them steer the subject s images in a positive direction but observe their responses carefully in case they are resisting maintain the calm steady tone of voice throughout the session suggest imagery that mixes positively with their existing responses be prepared to bring them out of the hypnotic state in the case of an adverse physical reaction use multiple sessions for experimental situations you may take some time to find what techniques and images work best with the subject and neither hypnotist nor subject should expect an instant cure especially in trauma cases or when dealing with prolonged pain suffering 7 x research source establish from the outset that the hypnotic technique can take many sessions schedule a regular time interval for the sessions both parties should bring up issues if they feel the sessions are not working as they expect plant a suggestion in the subject s mind this is a more direct approach than the imagery method 8 x research source this can actually involve a suggestion to use your imagination but suggestions if successful should seem to take less effort this method can result in more specific changes to behavior and or perceptions than other techniques more careful instruction on the part of the hypnotist will be required speak the instruction after hypnotic induction after the subject is in the hypnotic state they are receptive to suggestions and the hypnotist can pass along the instruction or condition 9 x research source the instruction needs to be specific but simple create a cue such as the opening of eyes or ringing of a bell to start and end the instruction s effect do not deviate from your calm steady voice during the conditioning bring the subject out of the period of suggestion with the cue you created target a particular behavior and or sensation if you are experimenting it s best to try one suggestion at a time if your subject choose a specific behavior they want elicited or stopped modify your instructions accordingly in the experimental setting the hypnotist can try some practical suggestions as long as they are careful they will do no harm the hypnotist can try suggesting the subject perform an action like take a drink eat write the hypnotist could try having them respond to a command or stimulus such as doing one action when you play a musical note the hypnotist can suggest something more complex perhaps having them respond with a specific phrase when you give a command phrase stopping habits like smoking nail biting and the like is a common use for this technique this technique can also create behaviors and images like seeing lost friends memory effects and pain displacement plan regular sessions while this technique is not as drawn out as the imagery method multiple sessions can still be useful for testing variations of the experimental version s effectiveness extended therapy sessions can also be beneficial maintain communication between hypnotist and subject to determine if the therapy is improving behavior and or lifestyle make sure there isn t a more serious medical problem if prolonged sessions are not having an effect consider other techniques if suggestion therapy isn t working then the subject may need encouragement to pursue other methods examine the other hypnotic tricks approaches like image and cognitive therapy for their potential benefits discuss with the subject if they are willing to try these other methods if significantly more pronounced mental illness is presenting itself then a mental health professional should be consulted for further examination prepare your subject for a deeper relaxation because the cognitive therapy trick is usually tasked with exploring the unconscious memory centers of the mind and potentially removing unwanted memories thoughts this tends to require a deeper trance like state in addition to the techniques to put the subject into the relaxed state eliminating all potential noise pollution may be a good idea take extra precautions that the session will not be disturbed externally discuss the sessions goals thoroughly for experimental sessions make sure your subject is okay with you probing around their subconscious for therapeutic sessions it is possible the subject may not know specifically what thought or memory they want or need to have removed but clear up as much as possible 10 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source in experimental sessions it will be up to the hypnotist if they want to go in with foreknowledge of the subject s background or enter in blind and not risk preconceptions as this is entirely exploratory for both parties whether dealing with a traumatic memory or source of pain getting context information may help when searching for the memory during the session be as reasonably accommodating as you can to make the subject comfortable in communicating these preliminary details to you talk the subject through their memories during the session the hypnotist will be having a discussion with the subject s thoughts the trance like state bypasses the conscious mind so the hypnotist is directly talking to the subconscious this allows the subject to talk about things they may not normally disclose to another person as a person is still aware during a hypnosis session they will remember they are disclosing this memory to the hypnotist in a experimental session the hypnotist could try a few techniques on the subject s memories the hypnotist could start with something basic such as childhood or more recent perhaps at a job and talk the subject through their emotional state during those experience during the experimental session the hypnotist will listen to the subject s associations with these memories and can bridge from memory to memory and form a picture of sorts of how the subject s mind is working at the subconscious level other experimental techniques could include having the subject revisit old memories to discover new things they had not realized themselves about the event in a therapeutic session the hypnotist should lead the discussion to find the source of the unwanted memory ask questions to drive the patient in that direction and calmly ascertain the reason the memory is causing the subject trauma and or pain in the therapeutic session when the hypnotist brings the patient out of the trance ideally the patient will be able to now consciously confront and or overcome the problem memories know what to use cognitive hypnotherapy for as this is a deep dive into the psyche of a subject the benefits of this method are numerous but should be carefully targeted as with the other techniques in the experimental trick version of this technique this can be a very intimate experience with accompanying risks and rewards the subject may be exploring unknown areas of their own mind with the hypnotist as their guide both parties should establish that looking into the subject s unknown memories is acceptable and in fact a desired outcome among this therapy s uses are to alleviate long standing fears anxiety insomnia depression stress grief from personal loss weight loss bad habits and even some physical ailments like skin conditions if you are attempting multiple experiments or addressing multiple traumatic problems it may be advisable to just take on one or two per session if the subject s condition ever worsens significantly and or becomes dangerous to the point of inflicting injury seek emergency medical care immediately schedule regular sessions as this technique can be less precise than the others it may take several attempts to understand how to access your subject s memories for the cognitive trick and get used to the associations they typically make for trauma situations it can take time to first identify the problem memories in a subject and then deal with them for experimental situations as this is exploratory you and the subject should not feel required to stay on one particular theme or track of memories in trauma cases if the sessions are sorting through particularly unpleasant memories pain consider longer intervals between sessions discuss if a journal record of some sort should be kept about what is covered in each session this will help keep track of the various paths your experimental tricks might lead your subject a journal in trauma situations will help so unrelated memories are not unnecessarily brought up again though keep in mind any memory may associate in unexpected ways as this technique requires a deeper trance make sure the subject has ample time to rest before and after sessions review results of this technique make sure the subject is responding to this deep dive trick or should be considering other approaches if the cognitive approach isn t working the analytical or suggestion tricks may be more successful the subject s case if too severe for any of these methods may need referral to a more specialized psychiatrist or doctor 11 x research source,Health

how to teach self hypnosis to autistic people,extremely high levels of anxiety are often an aspect of autism during early treatment the therapist often takes the role of help through exercises such as controlled breathing muscle relaxation techniques and the use of imagery at some point the therapist will no longer be with the child and therefore it is important to put young teenagers in charge of their own relaxation techniques self hypnosis works particularly well and the steps for this are included below,find out what the young teen likes and finds relaxing such as woods versus water sounds colors and more the more sensory likes you can learn the more effective will be the guided hypnosis and self hypnosis that follow do the relaxation and breathing exercises first suggest that the teen lay back in any position that is the most comfortable ask the young man or woman to shut their eyes if music is to be used which is often preferable turn on the music softly in the background regress the person this means moving beginning with where the person is alert and lying on a couch a carpet or other to a place of profound internal calm the regression is bringing the person through suggestion from being externally oriented to internally oriented and from anxious to extremely relaxed ensure that you are consistent use coaching prompts are memorized and or written down changing the words or images will negatively impact what you are trying to do as well as in some way confuse the individual use a five or ten count you knowing the person will have to estimate how quickly or slowly how many steps in short to go in order to achieve moving to that place of calm already mentioned this is essential to move from the present awareness to that place of peace using as many sensual cues as is possible such as hearing the water feeling the cool moss feeling the sunshine softly etc the more visual sensorial it is the stronger will be the impact of the process use what you learned during the preparatory steps if the person said that water is good or calming then build water into the scenario combine sensations such as soft moss to cool shade and warm sunshine warmth is most often equated with safety so this is the direction to head towards always start with where the person is and what there is to sense in the situation move deeper into self and the vision with each step carefully construct a scenario to shift from there anxiety producing here and now to a vision of a peaceful and safe situation that is pleasing to the senses once the person is in the place of peace reinforce that it is both peaceful and safe build in a safety assurance suggest that the blue light or the warm soft breeze keeps them both safe and calm while they are there make a recording for the individual create a tape or other recording of the music and your voice when high effectiveness is achieved self hypnosis occurs when the individual can use this recording without you present to add or delete certain prompts this happens when you create a voice over music tape or cd where the person can use it effectively without you even being present very clearly use an end of self hypnosis statement add in the recording a clear statement to remain in the highly relaxed state but also a slightly louder and clear end point when you will begin the return to the present each person will be different some will pick up and use the most subtle suggestions some require it to be more pronounced and to have it stated without other words just before or after it make a statement that you will be moving back to the present tell the person that although he she can return to this place of calm at any time but for now you are going to guide them back to the here and now use the same five to ten steps you used initially in regression but in reverse always begin with the place of peace as step one step two might be the bubble of light slowly moving away into the sky allowing the person to thank the light but begin to move again through the field toward the trees as was used in the example use the five or ten count reversed move methodically from being completely internally oriented to gaining awareness about the present complete the steps bringing the person back to the present include hearing other things in the environment and telling them that they are on the carpet couch and can feel it under them using sensory clues as to the present is just as important as they were during regression tell the person to open his her eyes slowly suggest moving legs arms neck etc when they feel ready to do so make sure the person is fully awake and aware of his her own body before they truly begin to move about you do not want someone to fall if they are not quite reoriented include this of course in the recording as well create a physical cue not otherwise used as the relaxation response trigger this is a bonus and rather easy to do it will become a lifelong skill for the person making anxiety easier to manage decide upon a physical symbol to trigger the response tell the person that whenever they do this symbol it will bring their anxiety back down just like in the imagery such as the field and the light bubble create the cue as something that would ordinarily not just happen for example when in the deepest relaxation suggest that if one touched their pinky to their opposite elbow they will feel just as relaxed as in the hypnotic state do not use something that could happen in everyday life for example touching the thumb to the forefinger happens when we write do not use something that commonly occurs but has to be used intentionally we do not accidentally touch our pinky to the opposite elbow in most instances reinforce this embedded response many times during hypnosis when not regressed remind the person that this type of touch will help them to feel calm monitor and suggest purposeful use of this for at least two months to ensure it is effective,Health
