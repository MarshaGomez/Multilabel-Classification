how to replant a rose,roses are beautiful flowers that are relatively easy to replant you can transplant a rose bush to a new spot by carefully digging it up and inserting it into a new weed free garden patch to regrow roses try planting rose stem cuttings and waiting for them to grow new roots,choose a garden spot that is free of weeds and other plants roses thrive when they are separate from other plants plant your rose bush in a section of the garden with other roses or alone ideally choose a spot where the roses can permanently reside so they will not have to be transported later 1 x research source use a hand fork to dig up and pull weeds opt for a spot that gets full sunlight 2 x research source make sure your soil is well draining roses will grow best in well draining soil before planting your roses test your soil is by digging a hole that is 12 18 inches 30 46 cm wide and 12 18 inches 30 46 cm deep then fill it with water well draining soil should not take more than an hour to drain 3 x research source to improve poorly draining soil add organic matter like compost to it dig a hole at least 15 inches 38 cm deep for your rose bush use a garden trowel to dig out a new spot for your rose bush prepare a hole that is about 15 inches 38 cm deep the hole should also be at least 12 inches 30 cm wide or large enough to accommodate your rose bush 4 x research source wear gardening gloves to protect your hands as you dig build a small mound of soil in the center of the hole use a garden trowel to pile some of the soil you removed from the hole back into the center of it make a small mound that is about 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm tall for the rose bush to rest on gently pat down on the soil to firm the mound 5 x research source dig around the bush carefully and remove it from the ground use a trowel or small garden shovel to gently remove soil from the perimeter of the rose bush dig down to its roots until its root ball is exposed continue digging carefully until you can easily insert the shovel underneath the plant to remove it 6 x research source you should be able to lift the plant out of the ground without yanking it adjust the size of the hole you dug out as needed after seeing the size of the root ball insert the plant in the new hole and fill it halfway with soil gently place the root ball of the rose bush on top of the mound gently refill the hole around the plant with the soil you dug up earlier stop when it is halfway full 7 x research source flood the hole with water use a watering can to flood the soil you inserted around the plant let it sit for about 5 minutes so that the soil can drain allow it to sit for longer if there is still water puddled in the hole after this time 8 x research source fill the rest of the hole with soil and water it again add more soil to fill up the ring around the plant base add about 1 inch 2 5 cm of water to the top of the soil and allow it to soak in give the plant about 1 inch 2 5 cm of water each week unless it rains heavily 9 x research source to prevent weeds apply a layer of mulch to the soil around the plant use a fertilizer specifically meant for roses after you replant your rose take cuttings in the late spring or early summer if possible the ideal time to regrow roses is during warm seasons before the intense heat sets in make cuttings in the late spring or early summer when stems are young but strong the warmth will promote fast root growth 10 x research source cuttings can also be made and replanted in the autumn but root regrowth will happen slowly and new blooms will only appear the following spring if successful cut off healthy stems about 5 8 inches 13 20 cm long use sharp pruners to make cuttings to avoid crushing the stems aim for cuttings that are between 5 8 inches 13 20 cm long make 45 degree angle cuts 11 x research source take cuttings from the top and sides of the plant mist the cuttings with water as you replant them to keep them from wilting 12 x research source the 5 8 inches 13 20 cm should not include the flower at the top sanitize your cutting tools before and after you cut the plant remove the flower from the stem use your pruners to remove the rose bloom from the rest of the stem this will allow the plant to refocus energy that was directed to the flower to grow new roots make this cut at a 45 degree angle 13 x research source keep some leaves on the stem when you replant it leaves provide sugars from photosynthesis to the rose cutting which will help it grow new roots keep 2 3 leaves on each stem located high up note that some varieties of roses will grow from leafless stems but the odds of regrowth are better with a few leaves still attached 14 x research source leaves can also provide root promoting hormones to the plant keeping more than 2 3 leaves on the stem will pull nutrients away from it hindering growth keep leaves located high on the stem so that they will not be buried under the soil when you replant it apply a synthetic hormone to the stem to promote regrowth rose cuttings naturally contain a root promoting hormone called auxin that collects at the bottom of the stems some roses may not produce adequate amounts of auxin to spur regrowth from cuttings to increase the odds of growing new roses purchase a growing hormone powder that contains synthetic auxin and dip the bottom of your rose cuttings in it before planting 15 x research source synthetic auxin can be recognized as either indolebutyric acid iba and or naphthaleneacetic acid naa purchase this mix at gardening stores or online plant rose cuttings in pots to keep indoors if the weather is cold if there is a frost the weather is not warm enough for roots to grow outdoors choose to plant your rose cutting in a pot and keep it indoors in cold temperatures as a general rule this will occur during the late autumn and winter 16 x research source pots can be placed outside in warmer weather or kept indoors use perlite vermiculite or a light potting mix as a medium in pots the potting medium you use to grow new roots should contain organic matter which holds moisture better than ordinary potting soil add the medium into a garden pot filling it 3 4 of the way water it until it is moist but not overly wet or pooling 17 x research source if you mix more than one medium use a trowel or small garden rake to mix them if you plant a rose cutting directly into the ground till organic matter directly into the top 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm of the soil to improve its growing potential insert the stems and firm the soil around them gently insert the bottoms of the cuttings into the soil mix 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm deep leave about 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm between cuttings if you plant more than 1 in the same pot gently press down on the soil around the stems to ensure that they are supported 18 x research source if the cuttings meet too much resistance to enter into the soil easily gently poke into the mix with a pencil or pen first to create openings add some kind of tent for a humid greenhouse effect roots will grow quickly in a warm humid environment create this kind of greenhouse effect by placing something around the surface of the cuttings either over the pot or on top of the ground to trap moisture and heat leave it on until new growth appears you could use 19 x research source an inverted two liter soft drink bottle with the top cut off an inverted mason jar a plastic bag held up at the top with a small wooden stake place the cuttings somewhere with moderate sunlight position the cuttings in a place that gets moderate sun and shade while your rose cuttings will benefit from some sunlight intense heat and rays may damage them before they take root plants can be moved to a sunnier spot once they grow strong roots 20 x research source it should take about 3 4 weeks for the cuttings to take root to test if roots have grown tug gently on the planted cuttings if they resist being pulled out roots have likely formed potted rose plants can be transplanted into your garden the following season once they are mature enough to survive replanting,Home-and-Garden
how to water air plants,air plants also known as tillandsia are popular low maintenance houseplants that don t grow in soil instead they pull the bulk of their needed nutrients from the air to keep your air plant healthy and happy it needs water about once a week bottled or filtered tap water works best avoid watering your air plants with distilled water since the distillation process removes important nutrients,fill a clean tub bucket or sink with bottled or filtered tap water choose a container or receptacle that can easily accommodate all of your air plants add room temperature bottled or filtered tap water to the container make sure you use enough water to fully submerge each clump 1 x research source always clean out the container before using it to water your air plants avoid using distilled water for this since the distillation process removes crucial nutrients 2 x research source submerge your air plants in the water air plants don t grow in pots or soil so you can easily gather the small loose clumps with your hands place each clump in the water bath and push it under the surface you can soak multiple air plants simultaneously 3 x research source if your air plant is mounted to a surface like a heavy shell or piece of driftwood you ll probably need to mist it instead of submerging it soak the plants for 20 30 minutes and shake off the excess water the air plants may float up to the surface as they soak which is fine just make sure the majority of each clump stays submerged for the full 20 30 minutes then grab each clump remove it from the bath and shake it off to get rid of excess water 4 x research source excess water tends to collect between the center leaves if you don t give them a gentle shake first which can eventually lead to rot and other issues if your air plants are particularly dry leave them in the water for up to 1 hour 5 x research source place each clump upside down on a paper towel to air dry completely air drying typically takes about 30 minutes but large or intricate clumps can take longer you can touch the center leaves with your fingertips to check for moisture return the plants to their original locations once they re totally dry 6 x research source always place clumps upside down to air dry so excess moisture can drain away repeat this process weekly to keep air plants healthy if the leaves look pale green and feel soft water the plant more often curled or rolled leaves also indicate dehydration 7 x research source during the winter months you can reduce watering to every 2 weeks 8 x research source fill a plastic spray bottle with bottled or filtered tap water use room temperature water for the best results be sure to avoid using distilled water which doesn t contain the necessary nutrients your air plants need to thrive 9 x research source spray each clump generously until the water is dripping off the leaves misting delivers enough water to your air plant as long as you re generous and thorough saturate the plant until water is running off the leaves 10 x research source mounted air plants often need to be misted because the object they re attached to can t be submerged in water if the object is porous bulky or heavy it s better to mist the plants mist your air plants at least once a week to keep them hydrated since they re tropical or subtropical in nature air plants will not last long without steady moisture 11 x research source thoroughly mist them at least once a week water your plants more often if you notice signs of dehydration air plants can dry out more easily if you re unable to submerge them in water to prevent dehydration watch for leaves that feel soft or look pale green leaves may also curl or roll up when they are dehydrated 12 x research source extremely dehydrated leaves may turn brown and brittle at the tips 13 x research source a hydrated air plant will look lush with darker green leaves place mounted air plants in a location that gets good air circulation unevaporated moisture can cause air plants to rot keeping mounted air plants in an area that gets plenty of air circulation so the leaves can dry completely after each misting session 14 x research source for example a spacious uncluttered room that gets plenty of light is a great place for your air plants make sure the surface your air plant is mounted on does not hold or absorb water for example cork would not be a good surface because it soaks up water like a sponge,Home-and-Garden
how to research the history of your house,if you own an older home you ve probably at some point wondered who slept in your bedroom long before you when your plumbing was last updated or why that ghost keeps hiding your car keys researching the history of your house is not only an exciting trip into the past but it can tell you how the house is built and give you clues as to how it should be maintained you can research the history of your house by examining the house itself looking at government records and reading through historical archives maintained for your city or town 1 x research source,evaluate the materials used over the years many different types of materials and styles of craftsmanship are used to build houses the types of materials used can give you some ideas about when the house was built and how long it has been since any changes were made 2 x research source for example one place you can look is under the water tank lid of the toilet if there is a toilet in your house that is original to the house the date stamp on the water tank lid will give you a good idea of when the house was built if the toilet isn t original that date will at least give you an idea when the bathroom was last remodeled if your house has a mansard roof for example it was likely built in the late 19th century however keep in mind that certain styles and housing designs were still being built in more provincial areas long after they had fallen out of favor in urban centers so the location of your house will be important in identifying the era in which it was built look closely both inside and outside your house and try to identify building materials used bring in an expert if you re unsure what type of wood or stone was used check out some architecture books go to your local library or research online to find out the design style of your house and when that style was popular in your area this can give you some clues as to when the house was built 3 x research source keep in mind that old houses often have been updated several times to reflect changing trends or the desires of the owners your house may incorporate several different architectural styles your house also may have been built at different times for example the original house may have been built in one style and then the owners built an addition in a different style 40 years later even with many decades of additions and renovations you typically can uncover a core style to your house this gives you a general idea of the era in which the house was built pay attention to design details and hardware used cabinetry and design styles go in and out of fashion through the years and these details not only tell you something about the history of your house but also give it a unique character 4 x research source the types of nails and molding used can provide some important clues as to when your house was built you can review design books or look online to find other instances of original molding or cabinetry to help date your house even if these elements aren t original dating them can provide clues as to when that particular room was remodeled scrape through layers of paint the walls of an older house may have 10 or more layers of paint if you don t want to cause too much damage to your house find an inconspicuous spot and scrape through the layers 5 x research source a professional can help you analyze the age of the lower layers of paint the colors used also can provide clues since different interior colors go in and out of fashion through the years the composition of the paint also can be analyzed to link it to a particular era since paint has been made using different chemical compounds over the years talk to your neighbors anyone who s been living in your neighborhood for a long time can help you understand more about the history of your house neighbors can be particularly helpful if you re new to the neighborhood 6 x research source ask them if they knew the people who lived in the house before you and whether they can remember any renovations being done if they are amenable you also can talk to them about the history of their house or ask to inspect its details since your neighbors house may have been built around the same time as yours this can offer you some important clues track down previous owners you typically can uncover the names of previous owners by looking through the deed history of your house in the united states this information is typically available at the county recorder or register of deeds 7 x research source once you have a name you can track them down on the internet for free or through a commercial people locator service keep in mind that some people may not want to be contacted and may not want to talk to you the house may hold painful memories for them or they may just not want to be bothered respect their wishes and avoid infringing on their privacy the best way to contact a previous owner typically is by sending a letter explain who you are and why you want to contact them provide them a means to contact you back if they re willing to talk use a metal detector in your yard a metal detector can be a great way to uncover old coins and other artifacts that may add their own unique story to your house and help you learn more about the house s history and its previous owners take care digging up artifacts in your yard you may want to contact an archaeologist or local historian if you believe you ve found something of possible historic significance visit your local courthouse or county recorder at the courthouse you typically can learn the official lot number or description of the property where your house is located you may not find correct information using your street address since these can change over time 8 x research source your local or county tax assessor also may have this information within the tax records for your property keep in mind that official record keeping of land and properties typically uses a different system than street addresses with which you re familiar this system allows you to track the history of your house from the moment it was built if you live in a place that has been continually inhabited for hundreds of years even the property grid lot system itself may have changed over time in this case you may also need to make a trip to your local historical society find a copy of your property s abstract the abstract records all deeds or other legal transactions associated with your property these documents typically are located at the county courthouse although you may have been given a copy when you purchased the home 9 x research source review the history of the purchase and selling price a dramatic increase in the selling price over a short period of time may mean a building or room was added or that the house was substantially renovated you can cross reference with any building permits for additional clues if you live in the united states visit your local or county courthouse to look at the deed registry usually found in the clerk and recorder s office this information is indexed by a lot and block number in a city and a section township and range for rural property go to your local municipal planning agency the government office that issues building permits should have public records pertaining to your house the building permit can contain a treasure trove of information including the house s original dimensions construction dates and costs and the names of the people originally involved in its construction 10 x research source keep in mind that you typically must pay a small fee to acquire these documents including a search fee as well as a fee for your own copy if your house is hundreds of years old you may need to visit the local historical society to find the building permit check city directories and atlases if you live in a larger city or town directories and atlases can help you uncover details about your house throughout the past in many areas these city directories and maps were in use hundreds of years ago 11 x research source directories and atlases also can help you identify changes in street names and other geographical details that you can use to target your research and find more information about your house these directories and atlases typically are available at the municipal planner s office if they are not there staff typically will be able to point you in the right direction review survey maps and field books survey maps and property field books are common sources of information about the history of a property these typically are located in either local or national archives and were maintained for tax purposes 12 x research source talk to someone at the property tax assessor s office to find out where historical records are kept and how you can access them keep in mind you ll typically need to pay a fee to have them retrieved read local newspaper archives your local library typically keeps archives of the local newspaper if there s more than one branch the central or main branch usually holds the largest collection 13 x research source if you live in a rural area with no library nearby try at the largest city or urban area or maybe the county seat that library typically will have archives pertinent to your area search backwards looking for mentions of construction in your neighborhood or the names of the house s previous owners keep in mind that street names and numbers can change over time so record any changes you see and the dates so you can construct a chronology visit your local historical society most regions have a historical society that maintains historical records and information about your house and your general neighborhood larger cities often have their own historical societies but if you live in a rural area you may have to seek out the historical society that covers a larger regional area 14 x research source if you have an extremely old house such as those commonly found in europe neighborhood information may be all you can find to research the history of your house if your house is less than 200 years old the historical society may have a wealth of information particularly if any of the house s previous owners were well known in the community or the house was the site of a significant event in local history take care handling delicate old documents and follow the historical society s rules regarding the care and copying of these documents search for information online there are many websites dedicated to preserving genealogical records and property history records often available for free you can use these resources to find information about your house as well as its previous owners 15 x research source for example if your house is in the united states you might search for records at the national archives and records administration nara website the nara maintains all official government genealogical and land records and also has links to other databases with a wealth of information if your house is in ireland or the united kingdom you might start your online research at the building history website located at buildinghistory org this site is maintained by a historian and provides a wealth of resources for researching the history of your house including deeds wills tax documents and maps as well as images and information about towns and villages compile a chronological history of your house as you uncover information about your house order it chronologically so that you can map the house s history from original construction to the present keeping your information ordered this way also enables you to identify gaps in that history where more research is needed 16 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to design a small garden,even if you don t have a large area in your yard you can still make a beautiful garden that maximizes the space you have before you begin digging or planting make sure you have a detailed plan for the layout of your garden and the plants you want to include look for plants that grow well in your area and are small enough to fit in your garden when they reach their full size with the right plants you ll only have around 1 hour of weekly upkeep for your small garden,choose an area that gets 6 8 hours of sun daily since most flowering plants and vegetables require full sun to grow properly opt for the sunniest area in your yard to place your garden if the area doesn t get a lot of light during the day you may still be able to grow plants that thrive in the shade 1 x research source plants that don t receive enough light won t produce as many blooms or grow as well pick a spot that s close to a water source try to find an area that either has a natural water source or sits close to your outdoor hose attachment that way the soil will stay moist and make it less likely to dry out and kill your plants if you aren t able to place your garden directly by a water source make sure it s as close as possible 2 x trustworthy source university of georgia cooperative extension division of the university of georgia focused on research and community education go to source you can also try building an artificial pond or water feature if you want to help keep the soil hydrated opt for a place where you can easily access your garden look for a place in your yard where you can see your garden from a window or a spot in your yard so you re able to enjoy it make sure you can walk into your garden with ease to make it easier to take care of your plants avoid placing it anywhere that s difficult to get to or else it may become more of a hassle 3 x research source measure the space you have available for your garden stretch a measuring tape across the length of the area and record the measurement on a piece of paper then take the measurement for the width of the area double check your measurements to make sure they re accurate so you can plan the space efficiently 4 x research source typically plots grow best in rectangular areas but you can make your garden a different shape such as a triangle or circle if it fits the space better plan the layout for your garden to scale on a piece of graph paper draw the outline on the paper so each grid square equals 1 2 or 1 square foot 0 046 or 0 093 m2 start by sketching longer rectangles for your garden beds so they re to scale for the actual size you want them then divide the rectangles into smaller sections for each different plant you want to put in them assuming that 1 2 plants usually take up 1 square foot 0 093 m2 be sure to leave a 18 in 46 cm space between garden beds so you can easily walk between them and care for your plants 5 x research source for example if you want a garden bed that s 3 by 8 feet 0 91 m 2 44 m and each square on the graph paper equals 1 square foot 0 093 m2 then you would draw a rectangle that s 3 squares tall by 8 squares long this bed would leave enough room for 24 48 plants work in pencil so you can erase and make changes to the design easily look online for digital garden planners to help you design the layout use square foot gardening for the most compact growing system make a grid on your design so each square is 1 by 1 feet 30 cm 30 cm make a list of the plants you want to grow and label each square on the grid with one of the plants from your list make sure you know the final growing sizes so you can easily manage how many plants of a species you ll be able to grow in the square 6 x research source typically you can fit 1 2 individual plants of a species in 1 square foot 0 093 m2 area but you may be able to plant more if they re small growths talk to an employee at a gardening center since they can help you choose plants that will work the best arrange your design so there are focal points aim to have 1 2 aspects of your garden design unique so they stand out from the rest of your plants this could be a statue fountain or small tree placed in the center or on either side take into consideration where you want people to focus or have their attention drawn to when they look at your garden and plan your design around those spots 7 x research source focal points help your garden feel more inviting and make them more visually pleasing paths in your garden can also help draw people s eyes in certain directions to help then flow visually put similar plants across from one another to create rhythm and symmetry rather than putting different plants in each of your garden beds opt for using the same plant or ones that have similar textures or colors so they re across from one another that way when you look at your garden it will look inviting and make the area feel more balanced make sure the plants on each side of your garden have approximately the same sizes or your garden design may look messy or unbalanced 8 x research source make the edge height ⅓ of the horizontal length to help it feel enclosed making your garden feel enclosed will make you feel more comfortable while you re working in your garden measure the horizontal length of the garden area and opt for plants or design features that are at least a third of that length in your design 9 x research source for example if you have a garden that s 18 feet 550 cm long aim to have plants that reach up to 6 feet 180 cm around the edges include room for seating in your design if you want a place to relax look online or at gardening stores to find outdoor seating that fits your space and matches your style draw the seating in your design and make sure you have paths that lead to it you can place the seating directly in the grass or you can set it on tiles or pavers for a flat even surface 10 x research source avoid using furniture made for indoor use since it could easily develop mold or get dirty from the weather you don t need to include seating in your garden if you don t have the space opt for raised beds that are 12 in 30 cm deep for better soil look for raised beds or containers that are around 4 feet 1 2 m wide and 12 inches 30 cm deep so the plant roots have room to grow avoid getting beds any wider since it can make it more difficult to care for and harvest your plants if possible orient the beds so they run from north to south to allow your plants to get the most amount of light during the day 11 x research source raised beds are easier to manage since you can more easily control the soil and nutrients inside the container if you don t want to use raised beds you can still plant in rows directly in the ground build the planting beds if you aren t able to find preconstructed ones in the sizes you need mix ornamental and edible plants together in your garden try to include at least 1 2 types of flowering ornamental plants in each of your garden beds where you plan on growing vegetables opt for plants that have different leaf shapes and a variety of blooms to make your garden look visually interesting talk to the employees at a local gardening center to find out what plants are the most compatible so they don t compete for nutrients 12 x research source some ornamental plants you can use in your garden include hostas hibiscus allium salvia lavender and sedum 13 x research source flowering ornamental plants also attract beneficial insects that kill other pests and help pollinate you don t need to include vegetables in your garden if you only want ornamental or flowering plants choose compact varieties of plants to maximize the space if you like the look of larger plants and want to grow them check your local gardening center to see if they have compact versions of them check the final growing size on the packaging to make sure they ll still properly fit in your garden beds at the end of the season include the plants in your garden design drawing so you see how much space they ll take up 14 x research source the most common vegetables that have compact varieties are cucumbers tomatoes zucchini and squash but you may be able to find others avoid planting anything melons or fruit trees since they can be difficult to control and can steal nutrients from other plants use companion planting to reduce competition for nutrients and manage pests talk to an employee at a gardening center or look online about the plants you want to grow and what pairs well with them try to position smaller plants in between larger ones so you can make the most of the growing space make sure the plants you select are compatible with one another or else they may not grow to their full potential 15 x research source include a fence or trellis to help plants grow vertically try to put the trellis or fence along the north side of your garden so plants growing on it can get the most light throughout the day aim to have a 5 6 feet 1 5 1 8 m tall trellis to help it support the most growth 16 x research source avoid placing a trellis or fence where it casts shade on other plants or else you could make them grow less efficiently 17 x research source trellises and fences work well for plants vine like plants such as peas beans squashes and tomatoes you may also attach shelves or containers directly to a fence if you want to grow flowering plants off of the ground try succession planting if you want a large variety of vegetation look for plants that stop blooming or are ready to harvest in the middle of the growing season then choose varieties of plants that thrive in the latter half of the growing season to replace the plants that grew earlier that way your garden will always produce fresh vegetables or blooms throughout the entire year 18 x research source for example you can plant radishes or lettuce in the spring to harvest in the late summer then you may grow summer squash in the same location to harvest in the fall 19 x research source mulch between your plants to help the soil retain water aim to have a 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm layer of organic mulch such as wood chips leaves or peat moss spread the mulch evenly across your garden so it s about 2 inches 5 1 cm away from any of your plants stems reapply mulch throughout the season if you notice it getting thin 20 x research source mulch also prevents weeds from growing in your garden beds water the soil when it feels dry 3 in 7 6 cm below the surface dig a hole in the soil that s 2 inches 5 1 cm deep and touch it with your finger if it feels dry use a watering can or a hose to water the soil until it s wet 6 8 inches 15 20 cm deep check the soil daily to make sure it doesn t dry out and kill your plants 21 x research source plants in containers or raised beds usually need to be watered more often than those directly planted in the ground apply fertilizer in the beginning and middle of the growing season you can either use liquid fertilizer or buy granules that soak into the soil apply half of the fertilizer amount on the soil near your plants and spread it evenly throughout the garden bed immediately water the soil so the fertilizer can soak in and give nutrients to your plants 22 x research source be careful not to get any fertilizer directly on your plants since you could damage them pull weeds out by hand when you see them growing check your garden beds weekly for weeds growing between your plants grab the weeds as close to the soil as you can and pull them straight out of the ground if you don t want to pull them by hand use a hoe or trowel to dig out the roots and remove them from your garden 23 x research source avoid leaving the weed s roots in the soil since they could grow back prune plants to control their sizes begin pruning at the start of the season to help promote new growth and in the middle of the season to help keep your garden looking clean remove any stems or branches that have damage or look leggy with a pair of hand pruners make cuts at a 45 degree angle to help reduce the chance of rot 24 x research source don t cut off any more than a third of the vegetation or else the plant may not grow back as easily,Home-and-Garden
how to cap off a sprinkler head,if you have sprinkler heads that are too close together or want to prevent overwatering in a certain area you may want to cap a specific sprinkler head to cap a sprinkler head you ll have to remove the existing sprinkler cap and replace it with a flat cap that will prevent water from flowing into that head you can also completely remove the sprinkler head and cap it with a pvc pipe cap,find or purchase a sprinkler cap or plug that is compatible with your system your sprinkler system should have originally come with the flat plastic caps or plugs that fit over your sprinkler head these caps plug up the water and prevent it from being dispersed on your lawn or garden if you can t find the cap that came with your system you may be able to purchase it on the manufacturer s website or at a hardware store 1 x research source each sprinkler system will use a different sized cap so it s best to find one made specifically for your system turn off the water to the sprinkler system locate the valve that controls the water that pumps through your sprinkler system and turn the valve clockwise to turn off the water this will prevent water from flowing out of the system while you cap the sprinkler head 2 x research source the shut off valve for your sprinkler system is typically on the side of your house shut off valves on sprinkler systems are usually blue clear the dirt around the sprinkler head use a gardening shovel to dig a 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm hole around the sprinkler head set the dirt on the side so that you can use it later to refill the hole 3 x research source clearing the dirt from the top of the sprinkler head will ensure that it doesn t enter your system when you unscrew the head s cap remove the cap from the sprinkler head turn the top of the head counterclockwise to remove the cap if you can t remove the cap use a pair of pliers to loosen it continue unthreading the top of the sprinkler head until it s removed 4 x research source screw the new cap onto the sprinkler head place the flat plastic cap made for your system over the threads on the top of your sprinkler head turn the cap clockwise to tighten it 5 x research source refill the hole and turn on the system turn the water supply valve counterclockwise to turn the water back on turn on your irrigation or sprinkler system and examine the sprinkler head you capped no water should be coming out of it 6 x research source turn off the valve to the system s water source turn the water valve connected to your sprinkler system clockwise to turn it off and cut off water flow typically this valve will be blue and located on the side or back of your home 7 x research source if you don t turn off your water it may spray out of the system when you remove the sprinkler head dig a 5 6 in 13 15 cm deep hole around the sprinkler head use a gardening shovel to create a hole around the sprinkler head set the dirt on the side so that you can use it later to refill the hole 8 x research source removing the dirt around the head allows you to access and remove the sprinkler head easier 9 x research source unscrew the sprinkler head make sure your hole is deep enough so that you can see the base of the sprinkler head grab the long stem of the sprinkler head and turn it counterclockwise to loosen it from your sprinkler system tubing 10 x research source you can use the extra sprinkler head to replace a broken sprinkler head or use it in another location along your system screw a pvc pipe cap directly onto the system purchase a pvc pipe cap that is the same size as the pipe in your sprinkler system place the cap on the threads that the sprinkler head was screwed into rotate the pvc pipe cap counterclockwise to secure it onto the system 11 x research source screwing a pvc pipe cap onto your sprinkler system will turn off that specific sprinkler head typically sprinkler systems use 1 2 3 4 in 1 3 1 9 cm pipe fill the hole with dirt and turn on the system go back to the valve and rotate it counterclockwise to turn the water supply back on access your sprinkler system controller to turn the system no water should be coming out of the sprinkler head that you capped 12 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to propagate elephant ear plants,elephant ears are lush jungle plants with large green leaves shaped like hearts while elephant ears can t be propagated from cuttings like many plants you can divide the tubers of a healthy parent plant do this in the fall then plant the tubers in containers or store them for the winter and plant them outdoors in the spring either way these hardy elephant ears will make a lovely addition to your home,dig up your parent plant in the fall for the highest chance of success for best results wait until the parent plant starts to go dormant in the fall and the leaves start to die off before removing it from its pot or in ground location dividing the new tubers from the original growth in the fall puts less stress on the parent plant because it won t be actively growing giving you a better chance of successfully separating the new tubers without harming the parent plant 1 x research source if you grow your elephant ear parent plant outdoors in the ground and the temperature drops below 40 f 4 c where you live dig them up in the fall and store the bulbs indoors during the winter since you ll already be digging up your plant this is a great time to separate the new tubers 2 x research source soak your tools with bleach to avoid transferring diseases first mix 1 part bleach with 9 parts water in a clean bucket place your pruning knife and shovel if you re using one in the solution let the tools soak in the solution for 30 minutes then rinse them with clean water before using them to dig up and cut new growth tubers from your parent plant 4 x research source the bleach sterilizes your tools helping prevent the transfer of any bacterial or fungal diseases that may be infecting your parent plant 5 x research source in addition you ll also avoid introducing new bacteria to the parent or new plant that may be lingering on your knife or shovel remove the parent plant from its pot or in ground location if your elephant ear plant is in a pot carefully grab onto the stems to lift it up out of its pot if it s planted in the ground use your hands or a shovel to dig around the plant to loosen the soil then grab the stems to lift it out of the ground 6 x research source dig around your in ground plant slowly and carefully so that you don t harm any healthy tubers and roots select healthy tubers with roots to divide from the parent plant first gently shake the plant or use your hands to loosen and brush off the soil so you can see the tubers bulbs then examine the new growth tubers to see which ones are sprouting roots as long as the tubers have at least one new root bud or sprout they ll likely be able to survive away from the parent plant 7 x research source choose tubers that don t have any blemishes or rotten areas as these may indicate that the plant has a disease that can prevent it from successfully propagating 8 x research source separate the new tubers from the parent plant carefully untangle and cut away the new tuber s roots from the parent plant tuber s roots then use a sharp knife to cut the new tubers away from the parent plant tuber wherever they intersect 9 x research source elephant ear tubers have a potato like texture making them easy to slice through with a sharp knife you can cut all of the new growth tubers away from the main plant mass or leave some attached if you want the parent plant to grow larger more quickly plant the tubers indoors if you want to grow them immediately you can replant the tubers immediately if you want to put them in a container select a large pot with drainage holes and fill it with well draining potting soil make a well in the soil a little larger than the tuber and place the tuber in the well with the pointy side facing up lightly pack soil around the tuber and water it gently 10 x research source a mixture of peat moss and sand makes a good soil for elephant ears keep the tubers in a cool dark place until spring if you want to plant them outside if you live in an area with cold winters store your elephant ear tubers inside until spring place each tuber in a separate paper bag and put the bags in a cool dark place that stays dry until the weather warms up a basement is often a good choice as long as it s not too humid 11 x research source for best results keep the tubers in a room with a temperatures from 50 to 60 f 10 to 16 c 12 x research source select a planting location with full sun to part shade elephant ear plants are jungle plants so they do best in areas with plenty of sunlight avoid planting them beneath trees or structures that provide lots of shade ideally plant elephant ears in areas that get 6 or more hours of sun per day 13 x research source choose a location that is sheltered from the wind if possible plant the tubers outdoors once temperatures reach 40 f 4 c and higher if you ve stored the tubers indoors through the winter or if you live in a warm location you can safely plant your tubers outdoors use a shovel to dig a hole for each tuber that s about 5 inches 13 cm deep place each tuber inside the hole with its pointy side up cover the tuber with soil then water it thoroughly with the hose 14 x research source for best results let the soil temperature rise to at least 65 f 18 c it may take several weeks for the new elephant ear plant to emerge 15 x research source space the elephant ears 3 6 ft 0 91 1 83 m apart elephant ears are rather large plants so each tuber needs plenty of space avoid planting them close together or they ll fail to thrive 16 x research source lining your walkway or fence with elephant ear plants has a lovely effect keep the soil around your plants consistently moist elephant ear plants need moist but not soaking wet soil plan to water your plants each morning after checking the soil with your finger to see if it s dry about 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm deep water the soil around the base of the plant rather than the leaves 17 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to replant a rose,roses are beautiful flowers that are relatively easy to replant you can transplant a rose bush to a new spot by carefully digging it up and inserting it into a new weed free garden patch to regrow roses try planting rose stem cuttings and waiting for them to grow new roots,choose a garden spot that is free of weeds and other plants roses thrive when they are separate from other plants plant your rose bush in a section of the garden with other roses or alone ideally choose a spot where the roses can permanently reside so they will not have to be transported later 1 x research source use a hand fork to dig up and pull weeds opt for a spot that gets full sunlight 2 x research source make sure your soil is well draining roses will grow best in well draining soil before planting your roses test your soil is by digging a hole that is 12 18 inches 30 46 cm wide and 12 18 inches 30 46 cm deep then fill it with water well draining soil should not take more than an hour to drain 3 x research source to improve poorly draining soil add organic matter like compost to it dig a hole at least 15 inches 38 cm deep for your rose bush use a garden trowel to dig out a new spot for your rose bush prepare a hole that is about 15 inches 38 cm deep the hole should also be at least 12 inches 30 cm wide or large enough to accommodate your rose bush 4 x research source wear gardening gloves to protect your hands as you dig build a small mound of soil in the center of the hole use a garden trowel to pile some of the soil you removed from the hole back into the center of it make a small mound that is about 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm tall for the rose bush to rest on gently pat down on the soil to firm the mound 5 x research source dig around the bush carefully and remove it from the ground use a trowel or small garden shovel to gently remove soil from the perimeter of the rose bush dig down to its roots until its root ball is exposed continue digging carefully until you can easily insert the shovel underneath the plant to remove it 6 x research source you should be able to lift the plant out of the ground without yanking it adjust the size of the hole you dug out as needed after seeing the size of the root ball insert the plant in the new hole and fill it halfway with soil gently place the root ball of the rose bush on top of the mound gently refill the hole around the plant with the soil you dug up earlier stop when it is halfway full 7 x research source flood the hole with water use a watering can to flood the soil you inserted around the plant let it sit for about 5 minutes so that the soil can drain allow it to sit for longer if there is still water puddled in the hole after this time 8 x research source fill the rest of the hole with soil and water it again add more soil to fill up the ring around the plant base add about 1 inch 2 5 cm of water to the top of the soil and allow it to soak in give the plant about 1 inch 2 5 cm of water each week unless it rains heavily 9 x research source to prevent weeds apply a layer of mulch to the soil around the plant use a fertilizer specifically meant for roses after you replant your rose take cuttings in the late spring or early summer if possible the ideal time to regrow roses is during warm seasons before the intense heat sets in make cuttings in the late spring or early summer when stems are young but strong the warmth will promote fast root growth 10 x research source cuttings can also be made and replanted in the autumn but root regrowth will happen slowly and new blooms will only appear the following spring if successful cut off healthy stems about 5 8 inches 13 20 cm long use sharp pruners to make cuttings to avoid crushing the stems aim for cuttings that are between 5 8 inches 13 20 cm long make 45 degree angle cuts 11 x research source take cuttings from the top and sides of the plant mist the cuttings with water as you replant them to keep them from wilting 12 x research source the 5 8 inches 13 20 cm should not include the flower at the top sanitize your cutting tools before and after you cut the plant remove the flower from the stem use your pruners to remove the rose bloom from the rest of the stem this will allow the plant to refocus energy that was directed to the flower to grow new roots make this cut at a 45 degree angle 13 x research source keep some leaves on the stem when you replant it leaves provide sugars from photosynthesis to the rose cutting which will help it grow new roots keep 2 3 leaves on each stem located high up note that some varieties of roses will grow from leafless stems but the odds of regrowth are better with a few leaves still attached 14 x research source leaves can also provide root promoting hormones to the plant keeping more than 2 3 leaves on the stem will pull nutrients away from it hindering growth keep leaves located high on the stem so that they will not be buried under the soil when you replant it apply a synthetic hormone to the stem to promote regrowth rose cuttings naturally contain a root promoting hormone called auxin that collects at the bottom of the stems some roses may not produce adequate amounts of auxin to spur regrowth from cuttings to increase the odds of growing new roses purchase a growing hormone powder that contains synthetic auxin and dip the bottom of your rose cuttings in it before planting 15 x research source synthetic auxin can be recognized as either indolebutyric acid iba and or naphthaleneacetic acid naa purchase this mix at gardening stores or online plant rose cuttings in pots to keep indoors if the weather is cold if there is a frost the weather is not warm enough for roots to grow outdoors choose to plant your rose cutting in a pot and keep it indoors in cold temperatures as a general rule this will occur during the late autumn and winter 16 x research source pots can be placed outside in warmer weather or kept indoors use perlite vermiculite or a light potting mix as a medium in pots the potting medium you use to grow new roots should contain organic matter which holds moisture better than ordinary potting soil add the medium into a garden pot filling it 3 4 of the way water it until it is moist but not overly wet or pooling 17 x research source if you mix more than one medium use a trowel or small garden rake to mix them if you plant a rose cutting directly into the ground till organic matter directly into the top 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm of the soil to improve its growing potential insert the stems and firm the soil around them gently insert the bottoms of the cuttings into the soil mix 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm deep leave about 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm between cuttings if you plant more than 1 in the same pot gently press down on the soil around the stems to ensure that they are supported 18 x research source if the cuttings meet too much resistance to enter into the soil easily gently poke into the mix with a pencil or pen first to create openings add some kind of tent for a humid greenhouse effect roots will grow quickly in a warm humid environment create this kind of greenhouse effect by placing something around the surface of the cuttings either over the pot or on top of the ground to trap moisture and heat leave it on until new growth appears you could use 19 x research source an inverted two liter soft drink bottle with the top cut off an inverted mason jar a plastic bag held up at the top with a small wooden stake place the cuttings somewhere with moderate sunlight position the cuttings in a place that gets moderate sun and shade while your rose cuttings will benefit from some sunlight intense heat and rays may damage them before they take root plants can be moved to a sunnier spot once they grow strong roots 20 x research source it should take about 3 4 weeks for the cuttings to take root to test if roots have grown tug gently on the planted cuttings if they resist being pulled out roots have likely formed potted rose plants can be transplanted into your garden the following season once they are mature enough to survive replanting,Home-and-Garden
how to water air plants,air plants also known as tillandsia are popular low maintenance houseplants that don t grow in soil instead they pull the bulk of their needed nutrients from the air to keep your air plant healthy and happy it needs water about once a week bottled or filtered tap water works best avoid watering your air plants with distilled water since the distillation process removes important nutrients,fill a clean tub bucket or sink with bottled or filtered tap water choose a container or receptacle that can easily accommodate all of your air plants add room temperature bottled or filtered tap water to the container make sure you use enough water to fully submerge each clump 1 x research source always clean out the container before using it to water your air plants avoid using distilled water for this since the distillation process removes crucial nutrients 2 x research source submerge your air plants in the water air plants don t grow in pots or soil so you can easily gather the small loose clumps with your hands place each clump in the water bath and push it under the surface you can soak multiple air plants simultaneously 3 x research source if your air plant is mounted to a surface like a heavy shell or piece of driftwood you ll probably need to mist it instead of submerging it soak the plants for 20 30 minutes and shake off the excess water the air plants may float up to the surface as they soak which is fine just make sure the majority of each clump stays submerged for the full 20 30 minutes then grab each clump remove it from the bath and shake it off to get rid of excess water 4 x research source excess water tends to collect between the center leaves if you don t give them a gentle shake first which can eventually lead to rot and other issues if your air plants are particularly dry leave them in the water for up to 1 hour 5 x research source place each clump upside down on a paper towel to air dry completely air drying typically takes about 30 minutes but large or intricate clumps can take longer you can touch the center leaves with your fingertips to check for moisture return the plants to their original locations once they re totally dry 6 x research source always place clumps upside down to air dry so excess moisture can drain away repeat this process weekly to keep air plants healthy if the leaves look pale green and feel soft water the plant more often curled or rolled leaves also indicate dehydration 7 x research source during the winter months you can reduce watering to every 2 weeks 8 x research source fill a plastic spray bottle with bottled or filtered tap water use room temperature water for the best results be sure to avoid using distilled water which doesn t contain the necessary nutrients your air plants need to thrive 9 x research source spray each clump generously until the water is dripping off the leaves misting delivers enough water to your air plant as long as you re generous and thorough saturate the plant until water is running off the leaves 10 x research source mounted air plants often need to be misted because the object they re attached to can t be submerged in water if the object is porous bulky or heavy it s better to mist the plants mist your air plants at least once a week to keep them hydrated since they re tropical or subtropical in nature air plants will not last long without steady moisture 11 x research source thoroughly mist them at least once a week water your plants more often if you notice signs of dehydration air plants can dry out more easily if you re unable to submerge them in water to prevent dehydration watch for leaves that feel soft or look pale green leaves may also curl or roll up when they are dehydrated 12 x research source extremely dehydrated leaves may turn brown and brittle at the tips 13 x research source a hydrated air plant will look lush with darker green leaves place mounted air plants in a location that gets good air circulation unevaporated moisture can cause air plants to rot keeping mounted air plants in an area that gets plenty of air circulation so the leaves can dry completely after each misting session 14 x research source for example a spacious uncluttered room that gets plenty of light is a great place for your air plants make sure the surface your air plant is mounted on does not hold or absorb water for example cork would not be a good surface because it soaks up water like a sponge,Home-and-Garden
how to build a yurt,yurts are round tent like structures traditionally used in mongolia as mobile homes while yurts are not complex structures they do require some general carpentry skills to build and set up if you are a beginner purchase a yurt kit to easily build your structure if you re comfortable with carpentry search online for yurt building plans and make each piece of the structure yourself with some research and equipment you can create your very own yurt,decide on a spot for your yurt to protect it from the elements to prevent any weather damages be mindful of where you set up your yurt the best spot will be protected from wind receive sun in the morning get shade in the afternoon and be free of any overhead objects 1 x research source this way your structure will stay safe and secure overhead items include dead tree limbs for example use a circular platform that is the same diameter of your yurt the particular size of your platform depends on the overall diameter of your structure these instructions are for a yurt with a 12 ft 3 7 m diameter so review your particular instructions before you start and adjust the process as necessary 2 x research source if your platform is not the same size and shape your yurt may not be completely weatherproof you want the side cover fabric to extend below the interior floor level for a draft free watertight seal hire a professional to help you build your platform the platform is the hardest and most complex part of building a yurt if you are not familiar with carpentry work hire a professional contractor to make your base this is the easiest way to ensure you build your yurt safely and correctly 3 x research source if you d like to try building the platform yourself review the instructions from your specific yurt manufacturer many companies offer preliminary instructions on building your base yourself these instructions will vary based on your particular yurt kit place the footings in a circular shape according to your framing plan use 10 or so concrete footings to make the base of your platform the overall placement will depend on your particular framing plan but in general the footings should be 2 4 ft 0 61 1 22 m apart in a 12 ft 3 7 m circular shape 4 x research source use precast concrete footings cut the beams to the correct length and fasten them to the footings use a table saw to cut your wooden beams based on your floor plan then place the beams across the footings and use a level to ensure each beam is straight finally fasten the beams to the footings using the attached holders on the wooden beams 5 x research source for assistance with this process ask your professional carpenter your specific beam placement will depend on your instructions secure your flooring onto the wooden beams with your drill you can use 1 125 in 2 86 cm thick plywood to create your flooring lay the boards over top of your beams so they are flat and parallel and secure them on each side using a drill and a screw insert a screw through the plywood and the beam every 6 12 in 15 30 cm 6 x research source the size and width of your flooring depends on your particular instructions cut the flooring into a circle to match your yurt s diameter using a hand saw go around the edges and cut off any piece of plywood that hangs over your beams this maintains the overall circular shape of your yurt make your cuts so the flooring and beams are flush 7 x research source it s okay if the sides aren t completely even try your best to cut the wood as straight as possible apply waterproof caulking around the outside edge to seal out moisture this seals the flooring and the drip edge the drip edge is the outer edge of the yurt and it is important to seal the edge and the flooring so no moisture gets inside to do this run a thin even line of caulking around the perimeter of the flooring 8 x research source this way your wood is secured together and rain or condensation will not seep into your yurt secure a strip of plywood around the perimeter to finish the drip edge cut 3 8 ft 0 11 m exterior plywood into strips based on your desired width hold the strips around the perimeter of the drip edge and use a drill and large wood screws to fasten the strips of wood add 1 screw to each end of the strip when you do this you want 1 ft 0 30 m of plywood to extend above the floor level 9 x research source use a table saw to cut your strips to your desired size unwrap your lattice wall and grab a helper to get started the lattice wall often comes in a cylindrical package about 2 ft 0 61 m in diameter and 8 ft 2 4 m long for a 12 16 ft 3 7 4 9 m yurt remove the lattice wall and have a helper assist you in moving it to the back of the circular platform 10 x research source stretch the wall around the perimeter of your platform start by undoing the straps around the lattice wall ensure the outside is facing the outward direction and the inside of the wall is facing toward your platform then stretch out the lattice around the perimeter just inside the drip edge as you do this keep the lattice wall stable by holding it securely 11 x research source the outside of the lattice has holes in the middle of the rivets while the inside has no holes keep your fingers out of the way or they can get pinched as you unfold the lattice this creates the circular shape of your structure leave a 4 ft 1 2 m gap to install your door frame you want enough space to position your door frame at your opening though you can place your door wherever you d like to install the door remove the wingnuts and washers from inside the door frame and slip the end of the plate with the oval hole onto the clamp bolts then replace the washers and wingnuts and twist them into place 12 x research source ensure that the key side of the door faces outward consult your instructions if you have any trouble installing the door it should be easy and straightforward there may be a notch in the door threshold behind the door frame make sure the door threshold is outside of the drip edge check the perimeter of your yurt to ensure the wall height is consistent use a tape measure to check the height of your structure every 2 3 ft 0 61 0 91 m make adjustments to the lattice wall as needed by repositioning the wall 13 x research source your finished height depends on your overall yurt size secure the lattice wall to the door with the included hardware once your lattice wall is properly placed you can attach it to the door remove the cap nuts washers and bolts located along the bottom of the lattice about every 6th crotch then attach the lattice wall anchoring straps using the included screws hold the anchor into place and line a screw up with the hole then use your drill to secure the screw in place 14 x research source the crotch of the lattice refers to where 2 pieces of wood intersect these brackets are made so the screws go through the drip edge and the flooring material the anchors and screws come in your yurt kit secure the belly bands to the door frames once the door frame and lattice walls are attached make any final adjustments if you need to then lay the belly band along the top of the lattice wall tie 1 end of the belly band to the hook in the top door frame then feed the band through each crotch of the lattice as you go remove the slack in the line finally tie the belly band to the opposite door frame hook when you reach the other side 15 x research source belly bands are nylon or other stretchy strong straps they are usually 50 ft 15 m long alternatively your kit may come with tension cables instead of belly bands these often hook onto the door instead of tying to it after everything is securely fastened make adjustments as needed to improve the shape of the yurt put on a hard hat before you start installing the rafters treat the interior of the yurt as a hard hat zone until the rafters are installed as the rafters can fall on your head once the rafters are installed you can take off your hard hat while raising the center ring and installing the rafters is an exciting part of the assembly it should be executed with care 16 x research source children or observers not involved with assembly should stay outside of the yurt lay down the center ring and mark 3 4 evenly spaced holes for the rafters to easily install the center ring keep the bolt heads down and the nutted ends up then use a marker to make a spot for 3 4 evenly spaced holes around the circle the distance between each spot will depend on the size of your center ring then mark each spot where the set up rafters will rest on the cable based on your instructions 17 x research source if you need help with this step take a look at your rafter spacing diagram your marks are where you insert the set up rafters to raise the center ring attach 3 of the rafters to the center ring align your rafter at 1 of the spots you made on the center ring use your hands to lift up the ring and insert the pin of the rafter into the ring to attach it then repeat the procedure for your second rafter to attach the third rafter raise the ring off of the ground when you lift up the center ring let the first 2 rafters support 1 side then insert the pin of the third rafter into the marked hole lift the center ring into position using the third rafter maintain pressure on the first 2 rafters and place the notched end of the rafter on the cable 18 x research source there is a metal pin on the side of the rafter that easily slides into the center ring when attaching your rafters be sure to follow the marked holes and cable spaces it is helpful to have a friend stand close with another rafter to push the ring up until you have a few rafters in place it may be a bit tricky slide the remaining rafters into the top of the yurt to insert the rafter put the end with the pin in completely move the other end to the cable push the lattice wall slightly outward with your shoulder and hook the rafter to the cable install the rafters over your doors as your final step since these rafters help hold the belly band or tension cables in place keep your rafter pattern symmetrical to balance the weight and placement it is also helpful to keep 2 lattice wall crotches in between each rafter 19 x research source once you angle the rafter correctly the rafter easily slides into place do not force the rafter into the ring alternatively stand outside the structure put the rafter over the lattice walls and push the end into one of the slots along the roof ring 20 x research source when you have 4 6 rafters secure the person holding the center support can let go and get out of the way the number of rafters you need depends on your particular instructions install a screw into the pre drilled hole just below the belly band to prevent the rafters from lifting up use your drill to add the included screws to the underside of the rafter to find the pre drilled hole look on the bottom of the rafter near the tension cable or belly band 21 x research source do not use different or longer screws the screw provided is the correct size for the pre drilled hole secure the rafters to the door frame using header brackets each rafter has a slight notch to hold the tension cable or belly band in place against the door go inside the yurt and place the header bracket onto the rafter on top of the door rest the flat side on top of the door header then slide it forward so it is flush with the tension cable secure the brackets to the rafters using the included screws and your power drill 22 x research source before you fasten the header bracket to the door header make sure the door is straight install the safety cable to the rafters to hold them in the ring to do this remove the cable clamps from the safety cable and thread the cable through the pre drilled holes in the rafters when you reach the starting point bring the end of the cable through the loop on the opposite end and pull it tightly reposition the cable clamps and tighten them so they are secure 23 x research source you can then cut off any extra cable using a cable cutter install your roof insulation and liner facing if included in your kit not all yurts require insulation or lining but they conserve heat and protect your yurt from the elements install your insulation on a day that is not very windy and do this once the rafters are all in place use a step ladder to reach the top middle of your yurt and spread the liner over the rafters have a friend pull the hemmed end around the rafter ends then place the insulation on top of the liner you can secure the upper area while your friend secures the perimeter 24 x research source to secure the lining and insulation use a staple gun to add a staple every 4 8 in 10 20 cm once the insulation seam is aligned properly use the foil tape to secure the seam if you d like trim the insulation around the door frame so it does not get in the way take out the cover and place a step ladder in the middle of your yurt remove the cover from the bag and get rid of the binding straps the cover of your yurt is often in a bag made of the same material untie the straps around the cover then place your step ladder inside your yurt so you can unroll the cover 25 x research source unroll the covering toward the door frame to do this bring the top of the covering through the center ring opening once the covering is through the opening you can let the covering unroll until it reaches your door 26 x research source unfold your covering 2 3 times to begin wrapping the perimeter as you stand on the step ladder have a friend work around the perimeter once the covering is unrolled unfold it 2 3 times to cover a bit in each direction as you do this look for the cut out opening for the door in the top cover valance the cut out has many oval grommets rather than round grommets 27 x research source ensure the cut out is centered over the door so you can easily install the rest of the covering unfold half of the covering and secure it using connectors work with your friend to unfold the rest of the covering across the top and perimeter of the yurt once the covering is halfway unfolded and covers half of your rafters install a 2 5 twist lock connectors or s clips to secure the top cover at the door 28 x research source securing the cover near the door keeps the door detail aligned pull the top layer of the cover over the center ring and down the other side then tie a cord to a few of the grommets on the top cover use the cord to help pull the rest of the fabric over the center ring and around the perimeter finally pull the outside edge around so it is snug around the ends of the rafters 29 x research source it

how to research the history of your house,if you own an older home you ve probably at some point wondered who slept in your bedroom long before you when your plumbing was last updated or why that ghost keeps hiding your car keys researching the history of your house is not only an exciting trip into the past but it can tell you how the house is built and give you clues as to how it should be maintained you can research the history of your house by examining the house itself looking at government records and reading through historical archives maintained for your city or town 1 x research source,evaluate the materials used over the years many different types of materials and styles of craftsmanship are used to build houses the types of materials used can give you some ideas about when the house was built and how long it has been since any changes were made 2 x research source for example one place you can look is under the water tank lid of the toilet if there is a toilet in your house that is original to the house the date stamp on the water tank lid will give you a good idea of when the house was built if the toilet isn t original that date will at least give you an idea when the bathroom was last remodeled if your house has a mansard roof for example it was likely built in the late 19th century however keep in mind that certain styles and housing designs were still being built in more provincial areas long after they had fallen out of favor in urban centers so the location of your house will be important in identifying the era in which it was built look closely both inside and outside your house and try to identify building materials used bring in an expert if you re unsure what type of wood or stone was used check out some architecture books go to your local library or research online to find out the design style of your house and when that style was popular in your area this can give you some clues as to when the house was built 3 x research source keep in mind that old houses often have been updated several times to reflect changing trends or the desires of the owners your house may incorporate several different architectural styles your house also may have been built at different times for example the original house may have been built in one style and then the owners built an addition in a different style 40 years later even with many decades of additions and renovations you typically can uncover a core style to your house this gives you a general idea of the era in which the house was built pay attention to design details and hardware used cabinetry and design styles go in and out of fashion through the years and these details not only tell you something about the history of your house but also give it a unique character 4 x research source the types of nails and molding used can provide some important clues as to when your house was built you can review design books or look online to find other instances of original molding or cabinetry to help date your house even if these elements aren t original dating them can provide clues as to when that particular room was remodeled scrape through layers of paint the walls of an older house may have 10 or more layers of paint if you don t want to cause too much damage to your house find an inconspicuous spot and scrape through the layers 5 x research source a professional can help you analyze the age of the lower layers of paint the colors used also can provide clues since different interior colors go in and out of fashion through the years the composition of the paint also can be analyzed to link it to a particular era since paint has been made using different chemical compounds over the years talk to your neighbors anyone who s been living in your neighborhood for a long time can help you understand more about the history of your house neighbors can be particularly helpful if you re new to the neighborhood 6 x research source ask them if they knew the people who lived in the house before you and whether they can remember any renovations being done if they are amenable you also can talk to them about the history of their house or ask to inspect its details since your neighbors house may have been built around the same time as yours this can offer you some important clues track down previous owners you typically can uncover the names of previous owners by looking through the deed history of your house in the united states this information is typically available at the county recorder or register of deeds 7 x research source once you have a name you can track them down on the internet for free or through a commercial people locator service keep in mind that some people may not want to be contacted and may not want to talk to you the house may hold painful memories for them or they may just not want to be bothered respect their wishes and avoid infringing on their privacy the best way to contact a previous owner typically is by sending a letter explain who you are and why you want to contact them provide them a means to contact you back if they re willing to talk use a metal detector in your yard a metal detector can be a great way to uncover old coins and other artifacts that may add their own unique story to your house and help you learn more about the house s history and its previous owners take care digging up artifacts in your yard you may want to contact an archaeologist or local historian if you believe you ve found something of possible historic significance visit your local courthouse or county recorder at the courthouse you typically can learn the official lot number or description of the property where your house is located you may not find correct information using your street address since these can change over time 8 x research source your local or county tax assessor also may have this information within the tax records for your property keep in mind that official record keeping of land and properties typically uses a different system than street addresses with which you re familiar this system allows you to track the history of your house from the moment it was built if you live in a place that has been continually inhabited for hundreds of years even the property grid lot system itself may have changed over time in this case you may also need to make a trip to your local historical society find a copy of your property s abstract the abstract records all deeds or other legal transactions associated with your property these documents typically are located at the county courthouse although you may have been given a copy when you purchased the home 9 x research source review the history of the purchase and selling price a dramatic increase in the selling price over a short period of time may mean a building or room was added or that the house was substantially renovated you can cross reference with any building permits for additional clues if you live in the united states visit your local or county courthouse to look at the deed registry usually found in the clerk and recorder s office this information is indexed by a lot and block number in a city and a section township and range for rural property go to your local municipal planning agency the government office that issues building permits should have public records pertaining to your house the building permit can contain a treasure trove of information including the house s original dimensions construction dates and costs and the names of the people originally involved in its construction 10 x research source keep in mind that you typically must pay a small fee to acquire these documents including a search fee as well as a fee for your own copy if your house is hundreds of years old you may need to visit the local historical society to find the building permit check city directories and atlases if you live in a larger city or town directories and atlases can help you uncover details about your house throughout the past in many areas these city directories and maps were in use hundreds of years ago 11 x research source directories and atlases also can help you identify changes in street names and other geographical details that you can use to target your research and find more information about your house these directories and atlases typically are available at the municipal planner s office if they are not there staff typically will be able to point you in the right direction review survey maps and field books survey maps and property field books are common sources of information about the history of a property these typically are located in either local or national archives and were maintained for tax purposes 12 x research source talk to someone at the property tax assessor s office to find out where historical records are kept and how you can access them keep in mind you ll typically need to pay a fee to have them retrieved read local newspaper archives your local library typically keeps archives of the local newspaper if there s more than one branch the central or main branch usually holds the largest collection 13 x research source if you live in a rural area with no library nearby try at the largest city or urban area or maybe the county seat that library typically will have archives pertinent to your area search backwards looking for mentions of construction in your neighborhood or the names of the house s previous owners keep in mind that street names and numbers can change over time so record any changes you see and the dates so you can construct a chronology visit your local historical society most regions have a historical society that maintains historical records and information about your house and your general neighborhood larger cities often have their own historical societies but if you live in a rural area you may have to seek out the historical society that covers a larger regional area 14 x research source if you have an extremely old house such as those commonly found in europe neighborhood information may be all you can find to research the history of your house if your house is less than 200 years old the historical society may have a wealth of information particularly if any of the house s previous owners were well known in the community or the house was the site of a significant event in local history take care handling delicate old documents and follow the historical society s rules regarding the care and copying of these documents search for information online there are many websites dedicated to preserving genealogical records and property history records often available for free you can use these resources to find information about your house as well as its previous owners 15 x research source for example if your house is in the united states you might search for records at the national archives and records administration nara website the nara maintains all official government genealogical and land records and also has links to other databases with a wealth of information if your house is in ireland or the united kingdom you might start your online research at the building history website located at buildinghistory org this site is maintained by a historian and provides a wealth of resources for researching the history of your house including deeds wills tax documents and maps as well as images and information about towns and villages compile a chronological history of your house as you uncover information about your house order it chronologically so that you can map the house s history from original construction to the present keeping your information ordered this way also enables you to identify gaps in that history where more research is needed 16 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to design a small garden,even if you don t have a large area in your yard you can still make a beautiful garden that maximizes the space you have before you begin digging or planting make sure you have a detailed plan for the layout of your garden and the plants you want to include look for plants that grow well in your area and are small enough to fit in your garden when they reach their full size with the right plants you ll only have around 1 hour of weekly upkeep for your small garden,choose an area that gets 6 8 hours of sun daily since most flowering plants and vegetables require full sun to grow properly opt for the sunniest area in your yard to place your garden if the area doesn t get a lot of light during the day you may still be able to grow plants that thrive in the shade 1 x research source plants that don t receive enough light won t produce as many blooms or grow as well pick a spot that s close to a water source try to find an area that either has a natural water source or sits close to your outdoor hose attachment that way the soil will stay moist and make it less likely to dry out and kill your plants if you aren t able to place your garden directly by a water source make sure it s as close as possible 2 x trustworthy source university of georgia cooperative extension division of the university of georgia focused on research and community education go to source you can also try building an artificial pond or water feature if you want to help keep the soil hydrated opt for a place where you can easily access your garden look for a place in your yard where you can see your garden from a window or a spot in your yard so you re able to enjoy it make sure you can walk into your garden with ease to make it easier to take care of your plants avoid placing it anywhere that s difficult to get to or else it may become more of a hassle 3 x research source measure the space you have available for your garden stretch a measuring tape across the length of the area and record the measurement on a piece of paper then take the measurement for the width of the area double check your measurements to make sure they re accurate so you can plan the space efficiently 4 x research source typically plots grow best in rectangular areas but you can make your garden a different shape such as a triangle or circle if it fits the space better plan the layout for your garden to scale on a piece of graph paper draw the outline on the paper so each grid square equals 1 2 or 1 square foot 0 046 or 0 093 m2 start by sketching longer rectangles for your garden beds so they re to scale for the actual size you want them then divide the rectangles into smaller sections for each different plant you want to put in them assuming that 1 2 plants usually take up 1 square foot 0 093 m2 be sure to leave a 18 in 46 cm space between garden beds so you can easily walk between them and care for your plants 5 x research source for example if you want a garden bed that s 3 by 8 feet 0 91 m 2 44 m and each square on the graph paper equals 1 square foot 0 093 m2 then you would draw a rectangle that s 3 squares tall by 8 squares long this bed would leave enough room for 24 48 plants work in pencil so you can erase and make changes to the design easily look online for digital garden planners to help you design the layout use square foot gardening for the most compact growing system make a grid on your design so each square is 1 by 1 feet 30 cm 30 cm make a list of the plants you want to grow and label each square on the grid with one of the plants from your list make sure you know the final growing sizes so you can easily manage how many plants of a species you ll be able to grow in the square 6 x research source typically you can fit 1 2 individual plants of a species in 1 square foot 0 093 m2 area but you may be able to plant more if they re small growths talk to an employee at a gardening center since they can help you choose plants that will work the best arrange your design so there are focal points aim to have 1 2 aspects of your garden design unique so they stand out from the rest of your plants this could be a statue fountain or small tree placed in the center or on either side take into consideration where you want people to focus or have their attention drawn to when they look at your garden and plan your design around those spots 7 x research source focal points help your garden feel more inviting and make them more visually pleasing paths in your garden can also help draw people s eyes in certain directions to help then flow visually put similar plants across from one another to create rhythm and symmetry rather than putting different plants in each of your garden beds opt for using the same plant or ones that have similar textures or colors so they re across from one another that way when you look at your garden it will look inviting and make the area feel more balanced make sure the plants on each side of your garden have approximately the same sizes or your garden design may look messy or unbalanced 8 x research source make the edge height ⅓ of the horizontal length to help it feel enclosed making your garden feel enclosed will make you feel more comfortable while you re working in your garden measure the horizontal length of the garden area and opt for plants or design features that are at least a third of that length in your design 9 x research source for example if you have a garden that s 18 feet 550 cm long aim to have plants that reach up to 6 feet 180 cm around the edges include room for seating in your design if you want a place to relax look online or at gardening stores to find outdoor seating that fits your space and matches your style draw the seating in your design and make sure you have paths that lead to it you can place the seating directly in the grass or you can set it on tiles or pavers for a flat even surface 10 x research source avoid using furniture made for indoor use since it could easily develop mold or get dirty from the weather you don t need to include seating in your garden if you don t have the space opt for raised beds that are 12 in 30 cm deep for better soil look for raised beds or containers that are around 4 feet 1 2 m wide and 12 inches 30 cm deep so the plant roots have room to grow avoid getting beds any wider since it can make it more difficult to care for and harvest your plants if possible orient the beds so they run from north to south to allow your plants to get the most amount of light during the day 11 x research source raised beds are easier to manage since you can more easily control the soil and nutrients inside the container if you don t want to use raised beds you can still plant in rows directly in the ground build the planting beds if you aren t able to find preconstructed ones in the sizes you need mix ornamental and edible plants together in your garden try to include at least 1 2 types of flowering ornamental plants in each of your garden beds where you plan on growing vegetables opt for plants that have different leaf shapes and a variety of blooms to make your garden look visually interesting talk to the employees at a local gardening center to find out what plants are the most compatible so they don t compete for nutrients 12 x research source some ornamental plants you can use in your garden include hostas hibiscus allium salvia lavender and sedum 13 x research source flowering ornamental plants also attract beneficial insects that kill other pests and help pollinate you don t need to include vegetables in your garden if you only want ornamental or flowering plants choose compact varieties of plants to maximize the space if you like the look of larger plants and want to grow them check your local gardening center to see if they have compact versions of them check the final growing size on the packaging to make sure they ll still properly fit in your garden beds at the end of the season include the plants in your garden design drawing so you see how much space they ll take up 14 x research source the most common vegetables that have compact varieties are cucumbers tomatoes zucchini and squash but you may be able to find others avoid planting anything melons or fruit trees since they can be difficult to control and can steal nutrients from other plants use companion planting to reduce competition for nutrients and manage pests talk to an employee at a gardening center or look online about the plants you want to grow and what pairs well with them try to position smaller plants in between larger ones so you can make the most of the growing space make sure the plants you select are compatible with one another or else they may not grow to their full potential 15 x research source include a fence or trellis to help plants grow vertically try to put the trellis or fence along the north side of your garden so plants growing on it can get the most light throughout the day aim to have a 5 6 feet 1 5 1 8 m tall trellis to help it support the most growth 16 x research source avoid placing a trellis or fence where it casts shade on other plants or else you could make them grow less efficiently 17 x research source trellises and fences work well for plants vine like plants such as peas beans squashes and tomatoes you may also attach shelves or containers directly to a fence if you want to grow flowering plants off of the ground try succession planting if you want a large variety of vegetation look for plants that stop blooming or are ready to harvest in the middle of the growing season then choose varieties of plants that thrive in the latter half of the growing season to replace the plants that grew earlier that way your garden will always produce fresh vegetables or blooms throughout the entire year 18 x research source for example you can plant radishes or lettuce in the spring to harvest in the late summer then you may grow summer squash in the same location to harvest in the fall 19 x research source mulch between your plants to help the soil retain water aim to have a 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm layer of organic mulch such as wood chips leaves or peat moss spread the mulch evenly across your garden so it s about 2 inches 5 1 cm away from any of your plants stems reapply mulch throughout the season if you notice it getting thin 20 x research source mulch also prevents weeds from growing in your garden beds water the soil when it feels dry 3 in 7 6 cm below the surface dig a hole in the soil that s 2 inches 5 1 cm deep and touch it with your finger if it feels dry use a watering can or a hose to water the soil until it s wet 6 8 inches 15 20 cm deep check the soil daily to make sure it doesn t dry out and kill your plants 21 x research source plants in containers or raised beds usually need to be watered more often than those directly planted in the ground apply fertilizer in the beginning and middle of the growing season you can either use liquid fertilizer or buy granules that soak into the soil apply half of the fertilizer amount on the soil near your plants and spread it evenly throughout the garden bed immediately water the soil so the fertilizer can soak in and give nutrients to your plants 22 x research source be careful not to get any fertilizer directly on your plants since you could damage them pull weeds out by hand when you see them growing check your garden beds weekly for weeds growing between your plants grab the weeds as close to the soil as you can and pull them straight out of the ground if you don t want to pull them by hand use a hoe or trowel to dig out the roots and remove them from your garden 23 x research source avoid leaving the weed s roots in the soil since they could grow back prune plants to control their sizes begin pruning at the start of the season to help promote new growth and in the middle of the season to help keep your garden looking clean remove any stems or branches that have damage or look leggy with a pair of hand pruners make cuts at a 45 degree angle to help reduce the chance of rot 24 x research source don t cut off any more than a third of the vegetation or else the plant may not grow back as easily,Home-and-Garden
how to air layer a tree,air layering is a technique to propagate fruit bearing and flowering plants such as apple maple cherry and orange trees to make smaller clones of the parent select one of the newer branches on the tree and cut off a ring of bark wrap damp sphagnum moss and plastic wrap around the exposed wood to lock in moisture and help the roots form once you see roots growing you can remove the branch and plant it in a pot so it can grow,start air layering in the spring air layering works best when the roots have the summer growing season to form wait until mid spring when blooms just start to form on the trees pick a cloudy day to air layer the tree so the sun doesn t put stress on it 1 x research source you can also try air layering in the late summer months though the roots may not grow as well if temperatures dip below freezing during the winter choose a branch from last season s growth that s thicker than a pencil look for branches that point up and are at least 1 2 feet 30 61 cm long try to choose branches that grew during the last year since they produce roots better than old established ones make sure the branch is at least as thick as a pencil or else it may not grow well later on 2 x research source if you re air layering in the late summer choose growths from the current season instead you can air layer multiple branches on the same tree remove the foliage and twigs 3 inches 7 6 cm around a leaf node locate a point where leaves connect to the branch that s about 1 foot 30 cm from the end of the growth pull the leaves off of the branch by hand so there s about 3 inches 7 6 cm clear on either side of the node if there are twigs or other branches in that area cut them off with a gardening knife or pruning shears 3 x research source don t remove all of the foliage from the branch or else it won t grow as well when you remove it from the tree make 2 parallel cuts through the bark so they go around the branch push the blade of a gardening knife into the bark just below the leaf node until you feel it make contact with solid wood guide the knife around the branch to cut a ring into the bark move the blade 1 1 1 2 inches 2 5 3 8 cm lower down the branch and cut another ring around the branch s circumference 4 x research source don t apply too much pressure to the knife blade or else you could cut through the branch completely peel the ring of bark off of the branch put the knife against the top cut and push the blade down toward the bottom cut to start peeling the bark off pinch the piece of bark by hand and slowly tear it away from the branch continue removing the bark from the ring until you see green or white wood underneath 6 x research source you may need to make a vertical cut from the top ring to the bottom ring to help you get a better grip on the bark if you get skin irritation from tree sap put on gardening gloves before you peel off the bark scrape the exposed wood with the knife blade hold the knife so the blade is parallel against the top of the ring drag the blade down to the bottom of the ring to remove the protective plant layer on the wood scrape the wood up and down as you work your way around the branch 7 x research source rubbing the wood removes a layer of cells called cambial tissue which would cause the bark to grow back if you left it on disinfect your knife blade with rubbing alcohol after cutting each branch if you plan on air layering multiple trees that way you prevent spreading diseases or bacteria between plants apply a rooting hormone to the exposed wood get a liquid rooting hormone so it s easier to apply to the exposed wood dip a paintbrush in the rooting hormone and let any excess drip off of the bristles spread the rooting hormone on the ring you cut around the branch to help increase the chances of roots forming 8 x research source you can buy rooting hormone from your local gardening store or online rooting hormone isn t required to air layer trees but it may speed up growth moisten a handful of sphagnum moss in clean water sphagnum moss is a common rooting medium that retains moisture well take a large handful of the moss and soak it in a container with water for 1 2 minutes pull the moss out from the container and squeeze out any excess water so it isn t dripping wet 9 x research source you can buy sphagnum moss from your local gardening center wring out the moss as much as possible or else the excess moisture could prevent roots from forming and cause rot wrap the sphagnum moss around the exposed wood split the ball of moss into halves and hold one in each of your hands press the moss onto the top and bottom of the branch so it extends 1 inch 2 5 cm past the edges of the ring squeeze the moss tightly so it has firm contact with the wood and stays in place 10 x research source let go of the moss slowly to make sure it doesn t fall off the branch if it starts to slip keeping holding it or ask a helper to hold it while you continue working cover the moss with a plastic wrap or aluminum foil rip a sheet of plastic cling wrap or aluminum foil large enough to cover the moss off from the roll press the wrap or foil tightly against the moss and the branch so it has firm contact make sure to wrap the entirety of the moss so you trap in moisture and promote healthy root growth 11 x research source plastic wrap allows you to see when roots form easier than foil but either will work the same if the part of the branch with the moss gets direct sunlight throughout the day use dark colored or opaque plastic wrap to prevent the moss from drying out leave the branch on the tree until the moss fills with roots look through the wrap or peel back the foil once per week to check for roots growing throughout the moss if you don t see any leave the wrap on the branch and take care of the tree as you normally would if you do see roots around the outside of the moss then you can remove the air layer from the tree 12 x research source typically it will take around 6 8 weeks for healthy roots to fill in the moss but it may vary based on the climate and tree species the sphagnum moss should stay moist as long as it s wrapped tightly but rewet it if it feels dry when you check for roots fill half of a pot with drainage holes with potting soil choose a pot that has a diameter and height at least twice the size of the roots growing on the air layer make sure the pot has drainage holes on the bottom so the soil doesn t get waterlogged choose a potting mix meant for trees and pour it loosely into the pot 13 x research source buy potting mix from your local gardening center you can use clay or plastic pots for your propagation cut the branch off just below the new roots hold the branch with your nondominant hand just above the moss to keep it steady grip the branch with a pair of pruning shears right underneath the moss and squeeze the handles together lift the cut branch away from the tree being careful not to hit or damage the roots 14 x research source if you have trouble cutting through the branch with pruning shears use a tree saw instead remove the plastic wrap or foil from the roots poke your gardening knife carefully through the plastic wrap or foil to make a starting hole carefully pull the wrap apart by hand so you don t damage any of the roots inside pull off as much of the wrap or foil as possible but leave the moss around the roots so you don t stress them 15 x research source if you remove the moss from the roots the tree may get stressed and prevent them from growing well set the roots in the soil and backfill the pot hold the cut branch vertically with your nondominant hand and keep it steady in the center of the pot use a trowel or shovel to scoop more potting mix around the moss so it s completely covered continue filling the soil until there s 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm of space between the lip of the pot and the soil s surface 16 x research source shape the soil around the tree into a small mound to help prevent it from getting waterlogged or developing root rot water the soil so it s moist 2 in 5 1 cm below the surface use a watering can to wet the soil until it starts puddling on the surface allow the soil to absorb the water and let it drain from the holes in the bottom of the pot pour water in the pot until it puddles again and let it soak deeper toward the roots check if the soil feels wet 2 inches 5 1 cm below the surface and it does stop watering 17 x research source water the tree whenever the soil feels dry 1 inch 2 5 cm below the surface keep the tree in a shady area out of direct sunlight place the tree near a north or south facing window so it still light without being directly in the sun make sure there aren t any drafts near it since it can cause the soil to dry out or damage the tree keep the plant in its pot while the root system adapts to the new growing medium 18 x research source if you want to keep the pot outside make sure it doesn t get sunlight or else it will use most of its energy to make new leaves or blooms instead of roots plant the new tree in the ground during the next spring allow the plant s roots to fully develop in the pot which usually takes 4 5 months to form when you re ready to transplant dig a hole in the ground that s twice as wide and 6 inches 15 cm deeper than the pot carefully pull the tree out of the pot and set it in the hole before filling it back in water the tree as you normally would so it doesn t get stressed 19 x research source install a vertical post next to the tree and

how to hang corbels,corbels make great decorative features and they offer support to structures like arches balconies and shelving units if you want to use them as accessories use wood glue to attach your corbels for a secure hold hammer nails into the wall and slide your corbels over top with some basic tools and supplies you can easily hang your corbels,hold your corbels up to the wall to decide where to install them arrange your corbels in your desired location if you d like use a pencil to mark your placement so you can easily install them when you are ready this ensures you don t misplace your corbels lay the corbels face down on a clean flat surface if you want to use the floor lay down a drop cloth or piece of cardboard so dirt and debris do not get on your corbels lay the corbels down so the back edge faces you this way you can easily apply the glue 1 x research source place your corbels down gently so they don t get damaged apply wood glue to the back the corbel about every 1 2 in 1 3 cm apply your glue in dime sized beads working from top to bottom evenly space out your beads of glue and apply glue around the edges if you want extra stability 2 x research source purchase wood glue from a home supply store hold the wood glue up to your surface for 60 90 seconds after you ve applied your wood glue hold your corbel up to the wall push the corbel against the wall with moderate pressure for about a minute then let your glue dry for 2 3 hours 3 x research source your corbel should easily stay in place if it starts to slide apply more wood glue to the back 4 x research source hang your second corbel with wood glue after the first is secured after you ve installed the first corbel repeat the process for your other corbel it is best to work 1 corbel at a time so your glue doesn t dry out 5 x research source hammer in 1 nail at the bottom of your corbel for a more secure hold pick a spot towards the bottom of your corbel and hold a nail up to the corbel use a hammer to attach the nail to your corbel and wall be sure to use a nail thick enough to reach through both surfaces this way your corbel will stay put with confidence you can do this right after you secure the corbel the wood glue can dry after you install the nail 6 x research source if your corbels are painted you can use a bit of putty to cover up the nail if you d like place the putty over top the nail head to hide it alternatively you can use a nail gun use a stud finder to determine where to hang your corbels slide the stud finder across the wall where you want to hang the corbels listen for a beep or look for the light to flash depending on your model when the finder locates your stud make a mark with a pencil so you can position your corbels 7 x research source if you don t have a stud finder that s okay use heavy duty wall anchors and screws instead they can still support the weight of your corbels drill 2 holes into the back of each corbel if they do not have slots oftentimes corbels have keyhole slots on the back so you can easily hang them on the wall if your corbels do not have slots already installed create 2 holes about 2 4 in 5 1 10 2 cm from the top using your drill ensure your holes are parallel so you don t hang your corbels unevenly 8 x research source ensure your nail is the appropriate size for your keyhole or drilled hole place the nail inside the slot or hole before you hang up the corbel if the nail fits securely it is an adequate size most keyhole slots are 3 16 in 0 48 cm so you want to use a nail with a 3 16 in 0 48 cm head 9 x research source if you use the wrong size nail your corbel may fall off the wall use a pencil to mark the placement of each hole line your corbels up with your guidelines and make a mark on either side approximately where the hole or slot is located do this for both corbels so you can easily hammer in your nails hammer 4 nails into the wall at a 45 degree angle hold 1 nail up to 1 of the markings you made and tilt the top slightly upwards so it is at an angle then use a hammer to attach it to the wall continue hammering until about 1 4 in 0 64 cm of your nail sticks out of the wall 10 x research source hammer in a nail for each of your markings you should have 2 nails installed for each corbel use a drill masonry drill bit and a tapcon screw if installing corbels over brick 11 x research source hang your corbels from the nails once all of your nails are in place line up the keyhole slot or drilled hole with the tip of the nail to use keyhole slots place the nail inside the larger circular section and slide the nail into place to use drilled holes secure 1 hole on the nail then gently lift up on the other side to align the nail do this for both corbels and you ll add support or a decorative touch to your walls 12 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to grow bloodworms,bloodworms also known as bristle worms aren t technically worms they re the larvae of midge flies these bloodworms are carnivorous and can grow up to 14 inches 36 cm in length they re a little more intimidating than the average earthworm but they make great fishing bait fish food and plant food if you have a carnivorous plant in your home 1 x research source if you decide to grow bloodworms be careful these worms will bite they re poisonous and they turn into aggressive flies after 10 30 days if you don t use or kill them if you are bit you probably won t need to go to the hospital but some people are allergic and it s impossible to know ahead of time so just be careful 2 x research source,get a leak proof aquarium or plastic bin to store your worms your worms will need sunlight but you also have to keep a lid on them which makes an aquarium the ideal option however you can definitely use a clear plastic bin if you prefer if you only have a solid colored plastic bin you ll need to use a clear lid or wrap the top with plastic wrap every time you check on your worms 3 x research source the size of your bin doesn t matter all that much but the bigger the better you can grow 50 100 worms in a regular 48 by 24 in 122 by 61 cm aquarium pour a 3 6 in 7 6 15 2 cm layer of garden soil into the habitat bloodworms are notoriously resilient you can basically use any of the soil in your yard grab a shovel and dig up some grass free soil remove any visible bugs or pieces of litter and dump it in your habitat smooth the soil out with your hand to make it even and flat 4 x research source bloodworms will dig as deep as they possibly can the more soil you add the harder they ll be to retrieve when it comes time to gather them however the worms do need soil to eat sleep and grow add some animal manure to the soil to give the worms something to eat you don t need to be too scientific your worms don t need a ton of manure but the dangers of overfeeding are pretty minimal gather or purchase any farm animal based manure and add roughly 1 oz 28 g of animal manure for every 2 lb 0 91 kg of soil 5 x research source chicken and cow waste are ideal but you can use basically any animal manure do not use dog or cat feces your worms will die if you use them as a manure to feed your worms pour rainwater on the soil and mix it around to make a thick paste either wait for it to rain or grab a bucket you left out and pour a little bit of water into the soil keep pouring until the water level reaches just below the top of the soil grab a big spoon or garden tool and mix the soil manure and water around until it forms a thick watery paste 6 x research source tap water kills the bloodworms they actually feed and grow off of some of the microscopic bacteria found in rainwater you can use pondwater or creek water instead if you live near a natural body of water buy or find midge fly eggs to grow your worms if you live in a coastal area and want to collect the worms yourself look for small pale dots collected on the underside of leaves near bodies of water alternatively you can just buy the eggs from a worm dealer in your area anyone that sells bloodworm bait has a steady supply of midge fly eggs to sell 7 x research source you can certainly harvest the worms yourself by finding large numbers of worms near coastlines but the bloodworms grow into flies when they mature you may need to use the worms relatively quickly if you find them since it ll be hard to tell how long you have until they turn into midge flies 8 x research source the midge fly eggs are also known as chironomid eggs these are the same thing add your eggs to the soil and pour some dead leaves on top once you have or find your eggs set them down on the surface of your wet mud crumple up a handful of dead leaves and scatter them gently over the eggs the eggs begin growing in 5 10 days and will start eating the leaves and manure 9 x research source you do not need to do anything else other than leave the bin out in the sun while you re waiting for them to grow do not use any green leaves or grass the worms may die if that s all they have access to keep your habitat covered to keep mosquitos out mosquitos are especially fond of bloodworm eggs and larvae they eat the eggs and they ll suck on any hatched larvae if you aren t feeding or checking on your worms always keep the lid on to keep them safe if you don t have a lid cover the opening of the container with plastic wrap 10 x research source if mosquitos get into the tank it s basically game over and you ll have to start over with a new tank make sure your tank gets plenty of sun and the eggs don t freeze to keep the eggs happy give them plenty of sun and make sure they don t freeze if the weather gets too cold one night you can take them inside to keep the eggs from freezing 11 x research source wait a week or so for the eggs to hatch the eggs hatch in a week or so and you ll see small pink worms crawling around in the soil continue to leave the habitat out in the sun after the eggs hatch and keep the lid on to keep mosquitos out 12 x research source feed the worms a little manure and a few dead leaves once a week once a week drop in a handful of manure and dead leaves the worms continue to grow as you feed them but they don t require a ton of food to thrive 13 x research source it s exceptionally easy to take care of the worms at this point they re pretty resilient and they don t require a lot of work on your end check the habitat daily to monitor the bloodworms growth bloodworms grow and mature into midge flies 10 30 days after hatching so monitor their growth and color carefully look out for worms that are turning from a bright pink to a deep red to catch them and use them before they hatch check in on the worms daily to see if they re turning a deep red color or changing shape 14 x research source the worms curl up into loops or figure 8s when they re still larvae when they re become pupae they curl into a straighter hook like shape this is why it s kind of tricky to grow bloodworms you can t breed them and they eventually turn into obnoxious flies use the worms as bait or fish food before they grow into midge flies regardless of the reason for growing the worms you must get rid of them before they turn into midge flies the bloodworms go from a light pink to a deep red 5 10 days before they re about to evolve into pupae so go fishing or feed your plants or fish once they change color 15 x research source midge flies bite lay a lot of eggs and tend to be pretty insufferable you really don t want to let the bloodworms grow into midge flies store mature bloodworms in the fridge once they turn deep red if the bloodworms turn red well before you have an opportunity to use them you can delay the midge fly evolution by packaging the worms in a plastic bag and storing them in your fridge use a scooper to filter the mud out and place the worms inside of an airtight bag since the worms bite do not touch them directly to transfer them instead use a stick spoon or fork to scoop them up 16 x research source this will buy you roughly 2 3 weeks if you wake up one day and find flies in the bag you ll have to throw them out though pour salt on the worms to keep them from turning into midge flies if they re bait you can keep the worms from turning into midge flies for even longer by adding salt to the worms but you can t do this if you re going to feed your pet fish or plants it s totally fine if you re growing them as fishing bait though once the worms are in the plastic bag sprinkle enough table salt into the bag to cover the worms in a thin layer this will give you an additional 1 2 weeks 17 x research source some of the worms may die but it won t matter if you re using them as bait and you keep them refrigerated just don t let them turn rancid or decay in the bag rinse the worms in dechlorinated water to give them to pets or plants if you re feeding the bloodworms to a carnivorous plant or pet fish you need to rinse the worms off to remove any bacteria or germs fill a small bucket with dechlorinated water and scoop the worms inside let them swim around for 30 45 seconds and use your scooper to pick them back up when feeding them to your fish or plant hold the worms with tongs or a spoon to keep them from biting you 18 x research source bloodworms are pretty pathetic swimmers you shouldn t have much of a problem picking them up out of the water,Home-and-Garden

how to care for fuchsia,fuchsia plants are beautiful perennials with bright pink purple white or orange blooms because the blooms hang downward they look fantastic in hanging baskets or pots a large bush of fuchsia outside will also add a lovely pop of color to your home garden keeping them happy will ensure you get to enjoy those beautiful teardrop blooms throughout the late spring and summer months,test the soil every day before you water the plant stick your finger 1 inch 2 5 cm into the soil to feel for moisture if it feels dry or if you rub your fingers together and see bits of dry soil flaking off it s time for a good watering 1 x research source if it s damp wait 12 to 24 hours before checking the soil again daily watering is especially important during hot summer months most fuchsias like to be watered every day but under or over watering can cause the leaves to wilt so it s wise to check the soil first hanging baskets dry out faster than standing pots so you may need to test the soil twice a day especially on hot or dry days pour water onto the soil until it drains from the bottom of the pot start by pouring water onto the base of the plant and then water the entire surface of the soil keeping pouring until you notice water dribbling out of the bottom of the pot the goal is to keep the soil evenly moist but not sopping wet if you don t see water coming out of the drainage holes they may be clogged or the soil may not be draining properly in which case you should re pot the plant water the plant 2 to 3 times a week in the fall once summer is over start watering your fuchsia plant every other day or just twice a week always test the soil with your finger first if it s bone dry go ahead and water it if it s even the slightest bit damp wait another day and check again 2 x research source withholding water in the fall will prepare the plant for winter dormancy so it can reenergize and grow beautiful blooms in the spring limit your waterings to 8 fl oz 240 ml every 3 to 4 weeks in the winter let the soil get relatively dry starting in mid november to early march the exact months will vary depending on where you live a good rule of thumb is to water it with 8 fluid ounces 240 ml of water every 3 weeks or each month but you can also feel the soil with your finger to see if it s bone dry if it is go ahead and water it and wait another 3 to 4 weeks before watering it again 3 x research source the plant will be in its dormant phase during the winter and your job is to make sure the soil doesn t get dusty dry a little dry is okay fertilize the plant once a week during spring and summer months use a fertilizer with equal parts nitrogen phosphorus and potassium a 20 20 20 or 16 16 16 blend is perfect the amount of fertilizer you need to use depends on the size of the pot but you should always read the instructions on the package 4 x trustworthy source royal horticultural society leading gardening charity in the u k providing resources for identifying growing and caring for flowers and other plants go to source for instance if you re fertilizing a 12 in 30 cm pot you might use 7 drops of liquid fertilizer for each 33 fluid ounces 980 ml of water or sprinkle 3 to 4 tsp 15 to 20 g of granular fertilizer on top of the soil if your plant is outside stop fertilizing it 2 weeks before you bring it inside for the colder months bone meal also makes an excellent fertilizer for fuchsia you can buy it at any garden supply store pick a spot that gets morning sunshine and afternoon shade if you have a potted or hanging plant put it near an east south or west facing window to give it the perfect amount of light if you want to put your fuchsia outside place it on a shaded porch under an awning or beneath a tree with lots of foliage 5 x research source fuchsias can handle direct lighting but hot afternoon sunlight may burn the leaves avoid putting your plant in a windy place fuchsias are delicate especially the blooms so make sure your plant is guarded from strong winds if it s outside if it s inside put it in a non drafty area away from fans or vents 6 x research source strong winds can dry out the plant too quickly and if it s hot enough outside warm winds can cause heat stress keep your plant in a place that s 60 to 75ºf 15 to 24ºc place the plant in a room with moderate temperatures if you d rather keep it outside check the forecast for that day to make sure temperatures are mild and pleasant depending on where you live late spring and early fall are good times to give your fuchsia some time outside 7 x research source temperatures over 76ºf 24ºc will stop the plant from growing their beautiful blooms if your fuchsia is outside it can tolerate overnight temperatures ranging 50 to 60ºf 10 to 15ºc bring outdoor fuchsias inside before the first frost of the fall plan to relocate the plant from outside to inside once september or october rolls around put it near a window but not right next to it so the leaves don t get cold from touching the glass 8 x research source check your city s agricultural hardiness zone to see when you can expect the first frost any leaves touching a chilly window could get burned from the cold prune the plant in the early spring before the growth period wait until the last frost has passed and you see new shoots forming on the plant use garden shears to cut off dead or broken shoots at a 45 degree angle just above the knobby nodes 9 x research source cutting at a 45 degree angle helps prevent disease and allows the plant to take in more moisture and nutrients if your plant is potted or indoors prune until the plant is only 4 inches 10 cm to 8 inches 20 cm above the soil level cut above the second or third nodes that have 2 leaves count the nodes upwards from the base of the main stem once you reach the second node or third node place the blade of your shears right above it and snip 10 x research source it may seem like you re cutting a lot off but this will allow your fuchsia to grow back healthier and more robust save and propagate any of the longer healthier cuttings if you like pluck off drooping blooms and pods at the base of the bloom place your fingers right next to the bulbous seed pods between the blooms and the stems pinch the stem and twist or turn it to break off the bloom and pod 11 x research source the pods actually contain seeds if you don t pluck them off your plant may end up covered in pods instead of blooms cut outdoor plants back by half in the late autumn if your fuchsia plants are outside you ll need to prune at least half the plant away to prepare it for its dormant phase keep clipping the stems above the nodes and clip off any dead limbs you see until the plant is about half the size it used to be 12 x research source it may seem like overkill to cut the plant back by half but what remains will be a solid backbone to spur new growth in the spring if your outdoor plant is growing up against a wall encourage it to grow to the sides by cutting off stems that jut outward from the wall hang tacky traps above and around the plant to get rid of whiteflies buy some sticky yellow sheets from any garden supply store and hang them above or around the plants to trap them you can also find small yellow sheets on a post that you can stick into the soil around the edge of the potted fuchsia 13 x trustworthy source royal horticultural society leading gardening charity in the u k providing resources for identifying growing and caring for flowers and other plants go to source a pack of 3 to 5 sticky traps generally costs 4 to 6 and you can buy them online or at any garden supply store outdoor plants are more susceptible to whiteflies wash the underside of the leaves 1 to 2 times a week to kill aphids if you notice the leaves are curling or turning yellow use a hose to wash the undersides of the leaves direct the nozzle upward so you can get the undersides if your plant is inside use the nozzle on your kitchen sink to wash the leaves 14 x research source aphids also leave behind a sticky substance on the leaves when they suck out the sap spray the leaves with insecticidal soap to banish thrips and mealybugs fill a spray bottle with 16 fluid ounces 470 ml of water and add 1 2 teaspoon 2 5 ml to 1 teaspoon 4 9 ml of insecticidal soap or however much is recommended on the package shake the bottle and spray down the leaves with the mixture 15 x research source you can also use neem oil or make your own insecticidal soap cut back the leaves all the way to the wood to heal fuchsia rust if you see orange spots on the undersides of the leaves use pruning shears to cut back all the offshoots and foliage down to the main stems quarantine the diseased plant so the fungal disease doesn t jump to nearby fuchsias 16 x research source other signs of fuchsia rust include dropped or deformed leaves or circular patches of yellowing on the tops of the leaves if you only notice a few leaves that show signs of fuchsia rust pick those off right away and keep and eye on the rest of the plant for the next few days you can also use a fungicide like tebuconazole or triticonazole but these can do more harm than good if you plan to use them spray a few leaves and wait a week to see if the plant can take a full fungicidal spray down 17 x trustworthy source royal horticultural society leading gardening charity in the u k providing resources for identifying growing and caring for flowers and other plants go to source repot the plant with fresh soil if you notice any fuzzy gray spores inspect the leaves and stems for any fuzzy gray masses or browning as these can be a symptom of a fungal disease called botrytis blight remove the plant from its current pot and replant it with well draining soil that has more perlite and vermiculite and less peat moss 18 x research source avoid any blends containing silt or clay because these 2 ingredients will hold onto too much moisture use peat vermiculite or perlite based soil to ensure good drainage look for a good soil blend made for flowering potted plants check for peat vermiculite and perlite on the back of the package don t use garden soil for your potted fuchsia plants because it won t drain quickly enough and may lead to root rot 19 x research source the perfect soil will maintain some moisture but allow enough aeration so the roots don t get too wet coco fiber aka coir fiber soil is also a great option for fuchsias because it ll help loosen the texture of more clay like soil blends fill a 12 in 30 cm pot 3 4 full pour the soil into the pot and pat it down be sure to choose a pot with large drainage holes so water can drain out efficiently 20 x research source you can plant up to 6 small plants in a 12 in 30 cm pot lots of plants in the same pot means less pruning and quicker blooms in the summer 21 x research source place each small fuchsia plant on top of the soil if you bought small start plants pinch the base of the small containers to remove the fuchsia with as much of the soil intact place up to 6 small 3 in 7 6 cm plants side by side towards the center of the pot making sure no plant comes within 1 inch 2 5 cm from the rim of the pot 22 x research source if you re repotting an existing plant turn the pot to the side and wiggle the root system out of the soil shaking off as much of the old soil as you can if you re propagating 2 in 5 1 cm to 4 in 10 cm cuttings you ll need to fill the pot up with soil and then stick the cuttings 2 inches 5 1 cm down into the soil so they can stand upright by themselves scoop handfuls of soil into the pot until it s 1 2 inch 1 3 cm below the rim use your hands to scoop more soil into the pot starting from the center and working your way outwards toward the edge of the pot redirect any plants that start to lean over towards the edge as you add soil pat it down when you re done 23 x research source gently patting down the soil around each individual plant ensures there are no air pockets make sure the top of the soil of each smaller fuchsia comes up about 1 2 in 1 3 cm from the top of the pot this way they ll be even when you fill up the pot with soil water the plant very well after you ve repotted it pour water over the base of the transplanted fuchsia until water runs out of the bottom the key is to make sure there s no dry soil in the pot so the roots can develop 24 x research source if you ve transferred the fuchsia into a hanging basket water it until you see water dripping from the bottom for a good 3 seconds don t fertilize new plants for at least 6 weeks after you repot them because it can stress out the root system while it s still trying to acclimate to its new environment,Home-and-Garden
how to do a knockdown texture,creating a knockdown texture on a wall or ceiling is a great way to hide small imperfections and add visual interest to the surface doing the job right requires the proper technique a steady hand and specialized equipment including an air powered joint compound spray gun the trick is to spray on the texture lightly and evenly then to knock it down gently and quickly with some practice this is a project that most diyers can handle,remove all furniture fixtures and outlet covers from the room the more you can get out of the way the easier it will be to do the knockdown texture on the walls or ceiling move out all of the furniture that you can even if you re only texturing the walls the spray will get on items even in the center of the room 1 x research source if there is furniture in the room that you can t move cover it completely with plastic sheeting that s secured in place with painter s tape turn off the power to the correct circuit at the breaker box confirm that it s off with a voltage detector and exercise caution when removing light fixtures if you re not confident in your abilities contact an electrician clean patch and or paint the walls or ceiling as needed you can do a knockdown texture on new or old walls and ceilings but the preparation process will vary based on your needs keep the following in mind if the wall or ceiling is new unpainted plaster or drywall make sure the surface is as smooth as possible if there are dents nail holes or other blemishes in an older wall or ceiling patch them with spackle sand them smooth and prime them before proceeding clean older walls or ceilings with an appropriate cleanser based on the paint finish then let them dry fully before applying a knockdown texture although people typically paint or repaint the wall ceiling after applying the knockdown texture you can also paint it an off white color beforehand that way the white unpainted texture will provide a subtle color contrast cover or tape over everything in the room that you don t want textured cover the floor completely with drop cloths and use plastic sheeting and painter s tape to cover any trim windows or other areas that aren t being textured after you ve removed the cover plates from the electrical outlets and switches place tape over the opening in the wall or ceiling 2 x research source if you re texturing the ceiling use tape and thin plastic sheeting to cover all of the walls if you re texturing the walls do the same with the ceiling don t try to take a shortcut here taking the time to properly cover everything you don t want to texture will save you far more time in the long run assemble the spray gun according to the product instructions go to a home improvement store and rent or buy a drywall spray gun kit including a hopper 8 12 mm nozzle air hose and 30 40 psi air compressor rely on the instructions that come with the gun for assembly guidance and ask for a demo when you rent or buy the spray gun generally speaking you ll do the following 3 x research source attach the hopper where you ll add the joint compound to the top of the spray gun connect the air hose to the spray gun and the air compressor attach the spray nozzle to the tip of the spray gun mix the joint compound and water until you get a pancake batter consistency add 2 in 5 1 cm of water to a 2 us gal 7 6 l bucket then pour in an entire 1 5 us gal 5 7 l bucket of joint compound dry mix lock a paddle attachment onto a power drill and use it to stir the mixture until there are no lumps wait 15 minutes then test the consistency of the mix if it s thicker than pancake batter mix in about 0 5 in 1 3 cm of water at a time until the consistency is right 4 x research source if you re not sure what pancake batter consistency is grab a small drywall knife and scoop up some of the mix tilt the knife blade slightly if the mix slides right off it s thin enough if you re texturing an area larger than about 150 sq ft 14 m2 which is the area of the ceiling in an average room break up the room into sections and mix up individual batches for each section for instance do half the ceiling in the morning and the other half in the afternoon you can find all of these supplies at a home improvement store fill the hopper partway and set up a spray testing area scoop or pour the mixed joint compound into the spray gun s attached hopper until it s one half to two thirds full set up a roughly 3 ft 3 ft 91 cm 91 cm piece of scrap drywall or plywood or just practice on some of the plastic sheeting that you ve taped up in the room turn on the air compressor and hold the spray gun 18 in 46 cm from the testing surface 5 x research source read the product instructions to ensure that you know how to turn on use and turn off the air compressor properly before spraying put on eye protection to keep overspray out of your eyes it s also a good idea to wear a hat and long sleeves wear a dust mask if you re concerned about possibly breathing in overspray particles practice your spraying technique on the test surface following the spray gun s instructions squeeze the trigger to release a loose spray of joint compound keep the spray gun about 18 in 46 cm from the test surface and wave the gun back and forth in a smooth steady motion to ensure even coverage over the surface keep practicing until you ve got the feel for spraying the right amount of the mixture 6 x research source the nozzle on the spray gun is adjustable you can make adjustments to increase or decrease the amount of spray your goal is to get 40 60 coverage in other words 40 of the area you spray should be covered in small random globules of the joint compound the other 60 of the area should still be bare search online for knockdown texture spray images for visual examples spray the texture on the wall or ceiling in 3 ft 3 ft 91 cm 91 cm sections if you re texturing the ceiling for instance you don t have to literally draw a grid on it however imagine that it s broken up into squares and spray them one by one using the technique you mastered during your practice session 7 x research source work to the edges of each section as you spray but try not to overlap the sections as you work otherwise the texture will build up too much at the overlaps if you spray while waving the gun in a smooth steady back and forth motion it s fairly easy to coat a 3 ft 3 ft 91 cm 91 cm section evenly it may take a little longer your first time trying a knockdown texture but you ll be able to cover an average ceiling in only 5 10 minutes with a bit of practice don t spray for more than 10 15 minutes before switching to using the knockdown blade if necessary do only one half of the ceiling or one wall at a time wait 10 15 minutes or until the sprayed texture dries only slightly don t go straight from spraying on the texture to smoothing down its peaks with the knockdown knife instead watch and wait for the wet shine on the sprayed texture to dissipate as soon as this happens grab your knockdown knife to finish the job 8 x research source if the sprayed texture is still too wet it will smear instead of flatten when you use the knockdown knife if let it dry for too long however you won t be able to properly flatten it out with the knockdown knife run the knockdown knife over the texture in a straight line using light pressure use a knockdown knife with an 18 in 46 cm rubber blade for this job attach an extension pole to the handle if you need it to extend your reach then lay the rubber blade flat at one end or corner of the surface area you just textured apply gentle even pressure and drag the knife in a completely straight line across the surface stopping about 2 ft 61 cm away from the other end or corner 9 x research source if you re texturing a wall start at the top corner of the wall where it meets the ceiling drag the knockdown knife straight down until it s about 2 ft 61 cm from the floor then lift it away light even pressure will flatten out the peaks of the globules of texture on the wall but it won t smear them into each other if you re worried about your technique here practice on a scrap piece of drywall or plywood first you can find a knockdown knife at a home improvement store likely near the joint compound mixes it looks like a large squeegee wipe off the knockdown knife blade after every stroke dampen a rag in some clean water and run it over the rubber blade of the knockdown knife to wipe away the excess joint compound that you scraped off the textured area do this every time you pull the blade from the wall or ceiling so that the knockdown knife is clean for each pass over the textured area 10 x research source keep a stack of damp rags handy so you can wipe off the blade quickly and easily work in from the opposite edge to complete your first row of knockdown with your first stroke you started at one end and knocked down a straight line until you were 2 ft 61 cm from the other end of the textured area now start at that other end and finish knocking down that remaining 2 ft 61 cm 11 x research source ease off the pressure on the blade as you meet your previous endpoint so that these two passes of the knockdown knife blend seamlessly continue to smooth the texture in straight rows with minimal overlap set your knockdown knife in position right next to your original starting point with 3 in 7 6 cm or less of overlap drag it across the textured area in a parallel straight line using the same technique as before repeat this process row by row until you ve knocked down the entire textured area 12 x research source work at a brisk pace you ll have about 10 15 minutes until the texture dries too much to be easily smoothed over keep your smoothing lines as straight as possible go straight over any taped over openings for electrical outlets fixtures or switches create curved lines around permanent obstacles only when absolutely necessary let the texture dry overnight before cleaning up the room the knockdown texture may be dried and set in only a few hours but it s best to give it at least 8 hours after that you can remove all the plastic sheeting painter s tape and drop cloths in the room and put all the electric fixtures and cover plates back in place 13 x research source wait at least 3 days and ideally a week before placing any furniture right against a wall you just textured or hanging anything like a mirror or framed artwork on it likewise wait 3 days to a week before painting the textured surface

how to cut molding,molding is a broad term that applies to different materials used in trim carpentry the two most commonly used types of molding are crown molding and base molding crown molding is used to finish the corners where walls meet the ceiling and base molding is applied where the walls of a room meet the floor while you ll cut base molding to be installed standing vertically crown molding should be cut and installed at an angle for most molding cuts you ll be cutting 2 beams at 45 degrees to fit together on either an inside or an outside corner while you can technically use any type of saw to cut molding a miter saw will do the job most effectively,use a tape measure to find out the exact length of the walls it s important that you measure as specifically as possible to the nearest 1 16 of an inch so that the cut molding will fit perfectly if you need to round your measurement round up measure all 4 walls if you re redoing a room or repairing a bad molding job if the wall you re measuring is longer than your tape measure just measure from 1 side of the wall as far as your tape measure will go for example say it s 100 inches 250 cm mark the spot with a pencil then measure from the other side of the wall to the pencil mark add the 2 measurements together to find the full length of molding you ll need 1 x research source if you haven t installed molding before work on measuring and cutting 1 piece at a time visit a local hardware store and find a molding you like there are hundreds of different types and styles of molding that all serve more or less the same purpose you can purchase long sections of molding at any hardware store or home supply store be sure to purchase sections of molding that are long enough to span the entire length of the wall s you re cutting molding for in fact buy about 10 extra in case you measured wrong or make a bad cut 2 x research source hardware stores will let you return leftover unused molding most molding boards are about 3 inches 7 6 cm wide and 1 2 inch 1 3 cm thick mark the length of the wall on the molding boards once you ve purchased the molding you ll need to mark the length of the wall on the boards this will show you where to cut the molding so it ll fit your wall hold the piece of molding against your length of your wall and mark the molding with a pencil if you re making an outside cut you ll mark the length on the top of the board if you re making an inside cut you ll mark the length on the bottom of the board 3 x research source for example say you ll be applying molding to 2 walls that are 105 inches 270 cm and 85 inches 220 cm respectively you ll need to measure out and mark those distances on 2 separate molding boards set your miter saw to cut at 45 degrees to set the angle raise the saw blade up and squeeze the handle at the front of the arm coming out of the saw s base turn the base until the indicator points to 45 degrees 4 x research source a miter saw comprises a large spinning saw blade that you ll lower into an adjustable base since molding boards need to fit tightly together in a corner or over the outward facing corner of a wall both angles should be exactly 45 degrees 5 x research source some types of miter saw may require you to loosen a knob before you can adjust the base s angle make sure to use a trim cutting saw that s between 80 100 tooth for a more precise and smooth cut place the front of the molding against the saw s base for an outside cut outside cuts are used for corners that jut out into a room 6 x research source setting the front edge of molding against the saw s base will ensure that the front of the board is cut longer than the back so the bottom of the board needs to be shorter for an outside cut set the back of the molding against the saw s base for an inside cut inside cuts are used for recessed corners by placing the back of the molding against the saw you ll leave the back edge longer and cut the front edge short 7 x research source so the front part of the molding needs to be shorter for an inside cut turn on the saw and lower the blade to cut through the board you can activate the saw by pulling the trigger this will typically be located on the inside grip of the handle squeeze the trigger and as the blade spins lower it slowly press the blade through the board and catch the cut molding before it falls to the floor 8 x research source keep your other hand on the molding board to hold it steady as you cut make sure that your hand is at least 6 inches 15 cm away from the blade at all times the board s cut edges will be rough and potentially splintered sand both of the sawed edges with a piece of 100 grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots 9 x research source cut a second board the same as you did the first so if you re molding an inside corner set the bottom of the board against the saw s base if you re molding an outside corner set the front of the board against the saw s base cut the second board just as you did the first one being careful to keep your fingers out of the way of the saw blade 10 x research source once the 2 boards are cut you ll be ready to hang the molding splice together 2 molding boards if 1 won t span the wall if you re applying base molding to a wall that s longer than your molding boards you ll need to splice together 2 separate boards as seamlessly as possible do this by cutting 2 boards at 45 degrees 1 board should be cut as if you were making an outside corner front side longer and 1 as if you re making an inside corner back side longer this way the boards will fit seamlessly together when you align them on the wall 11 x research source then use a hammer to drive 1 5 in 3 8 cm finishing nails into the splice cut to hold the boards together slip a jig under the molding board so it rests at 45 against the base crown molding is installed at a 45 degree angle between the ceiling and the wall hold the molding against the base of your saw so that the upper edge lies flat against the back of the saw then slip a small piece of board or scrap wood against the lower edge of molding to hold it in place 12 x research source you can use any type of scrap board as the jig or if you prefer not to make your own you can purchase a jig from a hardware store clamp the jig in place with a c clamp the clamp will keep the jig in position and ensure that your crown molding will be at an exact 45 degree angle for cutting if you re cutting multiple pieces of crown molding leave the jig clamped in place for each cut 13 x research source cut 1 crown molding board at a 90 angle the first piece of crown molding you cut will span the length of a wall and butt into both corners at a 90 angle make sure that your miter saw is set to 90 and will cut straight ahead then make the cuts 14 x research source be careful not to bump the jig out of place when you re moving the crown molding board around cut inside corners by cutting a molding board at a 45 angle set a second molding board in position against the saw and the jib if you re going to position this board on the right side of the already cut molding set the saw 45 to the left if you re positioning this board to the left side of the already cut molding set the saw 45 to the right once the board is in position make the cut 15 x research source when you position the 2 crown molding boards on the wall the first board you cut will butt square into the corner the second molding board will slip into place against the first leaving no gap between the boards use a coping saw to trace the profile of the molding onto the edge of one piece after making your miter cut this will help make your corners easier to install make outside corners by cutting 2 crown molding boards at 45 for an outside corner you ll only need 45 degree angle cuts rotate the saw to the left 45 degree mark and cut 1 board make sure the board is held tightly in place against the jib 16 x research source then rotate the saw to the right 45 degree mark and cut your second board use a corner block to eliminate miter cuts and make the molding easier to install,Home-and-Garden

your apartment smell more like home don t underestimate the power of a comforting scent lighting a candle in your apartment can change the feel almost instantly especially if you choose a candle that smells like baked goods warm vanilla sandalwood or leather or if there was a certain candle you loved at your last place you could light that instead 8 x research source if your lease doesn t allow you to burn candles in your apartment set up a time release air freshener in a scent you love switch out the light fixtures to warm up the apartment to add personality and style to your rooms talk to your landlord about whether it s okay to temporarily switch out the light fixtures for instance you might place a pendant light over your dining table to create a cozy intimate feel or you could put a funky secondhand fixture in your entryway to create a focal point and draw the eye upwards 9 x research source keep in mind that you will probably need to replace the original fixtures when you move out so pack them carefully and store them somewhere safe if you can t change the light fixtures add extra lighting like table lamps floor lamps and even string lights to help your apartment feel more like home hang sheer curtains to let in natural light to help your apartment feel bright and cheerful opt for curtains that are mostly sheer on each of your windows the curtains should provide you

how to measure pond water temperature,the temperature of your pond is a vital component in plant fish and ecosystem health monitoring it closely throughout the summer and winter can help you make any changes you need to protect the organisms in the water you can measure the temperature of your pond by using basic water thermometers from an outdoor supply store to keep your plants and fish happy and healthy,use a handheld or floating thermometer to test surface water you only need a thermometer that can dip just below surface level you can use a handheld thermometer made for water or you can use a floating thermometer that s meant to float on top of the pond 1 x research source you can find water thermometers at most outdoor supply stores floating thermometers usually have a length of twine attached to them so you can tie them off and leave them in the pond for long periods of time set the thermometer probe 1 in 2 5 cm below the surface if you are using a floating thermometer position it so that the floaty is at the top and the probe is at the bottom for a handheld water thermometer put the probe into the water about 1 in 2 5 cm below surface level 2 x research source wait for about 30 seconds for the thermometer to take a reading if your thermometer has a digital reading attachment it will show you the temperature on the screen if you re using an analog one take a look at the numbers and figure out where the red line is to get your reading 3 x research source thermometers with digital readings are nice because you can keep it in the water as you read the temperature which can give you a more accurate reading attach a weight to a water thermometer or use a digital thermometer if you only have a handheld thermometer you can tie a weight or a rock to it with twine to make it heavy if you have a digital thermometer with a probe you can hold onto the digital reading screen while you lower the probe down most probes have a wire that s about 1 m 3 3 ft so it will be deep enough to reach the bottom of the pond 4 x research source if you are using a handheld thermometer make sure it s waterproof and airtight with a length of twine attached to it so you can pull it up lower the thermometer into a deep area of the pond usually the middle of the pond is the deepest area slowly lower your thermometer into the water until you hit the bottom and try to hold your thermometer steady 5 x research source if the pond is large you may need to take a boat out to the middle wait 5 minutes to get an accurate reading deep water thermometers need a little more time to adjust to the colder temperatures keep your thermometer underwater for about 5 minutes or until the temperature reading stays steady 6 x research source test the temperature of 2 to 3 locations to get an average bring your thermometer up out of the water and move to another location that s also pretty deep take 2 to 3 more readings of the deep water then add up the temperatures and divide them by the amount of readings you took 7 x research source for example if you took 3 readings at 56 f 13 c 61 f 16 c and 59 f 15 c add them together to get 176 f 80 c then divide that by 3 to get 58 6 f 14 8 c for your deep water temperature keep the water between 60 and 75 f 16 and 24 c in the summer surface water is more prone to fluctuation because it s closer to the air around the pond in the summertime try to keep your pond cooler than 75 f 24 c at the surface for the health of the fish and the plants 8 x trustworthy source penn state extension educational organization dedicated to delivering science based information to people businesses and communities go to source use a water heater during the winter months if your pond might freeze if you have a small pond on your property and you re worried that it could freeze solid install a pond water heater to the inline pipe of your pond to warm the water as it enters try to find a 250 watt water heater for the best results and make sure you only use it when it s below freezing out so the water doesn t get too warm 9 x research source you can find water heaters at most home goods stores plant pond plants to provide shade in the water during the summer an easy way to keep the water cool in your pond is to use shade from plants in and around your pond try using floating water garden plants on the inside of your pond to keep your fish cool 10 x research source water lilies water lettuce and sweet flag are all floating pond plants that provide a lot of shade add in cool water during the summer to lower the temperature if you notice that some of the water in your pond has evaporated treat some cool tap water with a dechlorinator and then pour it into your pond this will help to cool down the entire pond as well as keep the water deep enough for the plants and the fish 11 x research source ponds naturally lose some water in the summer due to evaporation so you don t need to worry about it if you see the water level start to drop you can add 20 of your total pond water into the pond to cool it down for example if your pond has 100 gallons 380 l you can add in 20 gallons 76 l of water install a pond aerator if the water is too warm pond aerators add oxygen to the water and they keep the water circulating so it doesn t stay still put one of these at the bottom of your pond and use it during the summer to keep the temperature cool for your plants and fish 12 x research source you can find these online or at an aquatic store near you move your fish to a tank if the water drops below 50 f 10 c in the winter time try to keep your pond warm enough so the fish can still swim around if the temperature of your pond dips below 50 f 10 c it could be in danger of freezing transfer your fish to an aquatic tank until the threat of frost is over 13 x research source most fish can survive if the surface of the pond freezes over but they can t survive if the entire thing freezes solid,Home-and-Garden
how to keep an amaryllis upright,the amaryllis is a beautiful addition to your home but it can be a pain when it starts leaning or drooping these plants can get a bit top heavy or they can start to droop depending on the conditions 1 x research source it may take a little trial and error but it only takes a few minutes to make the adjustments needed to better support your amaryllis,grab a stake that s about as tall as the entire amaryllis plant find a garden stake or twig which will serve as a sturdy support for your drooping plant 2 x research source amaryllis plants tend to be around 2 ft 0 61 m tall so look for a stake or twig that matches this height 3 x research source you don t need a thick gardening stake for this a twig or other thin sturdy object will work fine 4 x research source insert the stake deep in the soil next to your amaryllis find an open section of soil next to your plant stick the stake several inches or centimeters down into the dirt or until it feels sturdy at this point check that the stake is really close to the plant so you can tie them together easily 5 x research source you can use stakes in potted amaryllis or flowers that you re growing outside tie up to 4 pieces of twine around your stake and plant grab at several 8 to 10 in 20 to 25 cm pieces of twine and knot them securely around both the stake and the amaryllis 6 x research source as a decorative touch tie the twine in a bow so your amaryllis plant looks aesthetically pleasing 7 x research source repeat this process with any other flowers you have grab as many stakes as you need placing them close to each flower take several more 8 to 10 in 20 to 25 cm sections of twine and tie them around your amaryllis plant for extra security 8 x research source display your plant in a temperate area with direct sunlight find a place in your home or yard that gets a little bit of direct sunlight like a window or side garden note that amaryllis plants thrive most in warm temperatures and don t do well when it s hotter than 65 f 18 c always keep your plant in a well lit area so your plant stays healthy and refreshed 9 x research source healthy amaryllis leaves will be pretty upright and sturdy on their own while unhealthy leaves will droop down rotate the flower pot each day so the flower doesn t droop in a certain direction check on your amaryllis plant each day to see how it s doing amaryllis flowers are huge fans of sunlight and tend to lean in the direction of the sun if they re kept in the same place for too long to keep this from happening turn the flower pot 45 to 90 degrees so the plant can stay upright if you keep your plant in 1 position for too long the entire plant will become lopsided 10 x research source it s okay if you forget to turn your plant sometimes just try to rotate it before the amaryllis gets too dependent on the sunlight water your amaryllis weekly to keep it in great shape pour lukewarm water around the base of the amaryllis without pouring it directly onto the bulb tap the soil with your finger to make sure that it s damp then stop watering once the soil feels dry again re water your flower 11 x research source only water your plant as needed if you add too much water the flower bulb may rot causing your plant to become sickly 12 x trustworthy source university of vermont department of plant and soil science plant and soil department at university of vermont s college of agriculture and life sciences go to source regular watering helps keep your flower as healthy and vibrant as possible,Home-and-Garden
how to make protective riot gear,though responsible civil disobedience is a cornerstone of democracy unfortunately even the most peaceful well intentioned protests can turn violent with police batons tear gas tasers and even fellow rioters posing potential dangers it s better to be safe than sorry don t risk getting caught in the midst of a violent fray between protesters and police forces instead come prepared with your own protective riot gear,protect your head with a helmet your head is perhaps the single most important part of your body to protect in a riot batons rubber bullets rocks and fists can all cause permanent damage if they strike you in the head even weapons that aren t meant to be shot directly into protesters like tear gas canisters can and have caused major injuries and deaths this way 1 x research source 2 x research source to protect against critical head injuries wear a sturdy helmet rioters are known to protect themselves with bike helmets motorcycle helmets hard hats construction helmets sports helmets headwear police military surplus helmets cover yourself with strong yet mobile clothing generally you won t want to be caught in a riot in your shorts and sandals the more skin covered the better as many anti riot weapons like pepper spray rubber bullets and so on are most effective against bare skin however you won t necessarily want to wear clothing that s prohibitively heavy or bulky as often the best defense against danger is simply to run away below is just one sample outfit that you might want to consider heavy but well fitting jeans that you can run in tee shirt or undershirt long sleeved overshirt of heavy cloth or flannel tough jacket sturdy leather or cloth works well scarf optional wear easy to shed layers while it s important to dress to protect yourself you won t want to commit too heavily to the outfit you re wearing during a riot try to wear clothing you can easily remove if the need arises and that you won t miss if you have to abandon it being able to slip out of an outer garment quickly can have some major advantages for instance it can allow you to slip out of someone s grasp it can allow you to escape noxious chemicals like tear gas and pepper spray that have seeped in to your clothes it can allow you to easily cool down during breaks in the action when you get a chance to rest wear sports pads to protect your limbs if you have a chance to visit a sporting goods store protective pads and guards can be very helpful in a riot though not quite as heavy duty as the gear riot police are likely to wear they can often prevent scrapes and bruises and may even offer limited protection against batons and rubber bullets commonly available pads that you may want to consider wearing are shin guards soccer football hockey knee guards skating thigh hip guards american football elbow wrist pads skating if you re male wear a cup for obvious reasons it s a good idea to wear a cup to a riot if you re a man don t forget this seemingly minor addition to your riot gear it can be a lifesaver wear shoes that allow you to run as noted above often your best defense in a riot is simply to get away from sources of danger in fact even die hard anarchist resources often prioritize a rioter s need to stay mobile over his ability to resist physical damage 3 x research source this is much easier to do if you re wearing shoes that allow you to run at a sprint try to wear at least reasonably tough athletic shoes or boots that are worn in and comfortable heavier boots like police or military surplus options can offer additional protection but may make it hard to run if you re not used to them consider wearing sheets of protective material under your clothes if you find that it doesn t impede your ability to move you may want to add strips or plates of hard protective material under your clothing to protect you from the hazards of rocks rubber bullets fists batons tasers and so on to attach these makeshift pieces of armor stick them to the inside of your clothing with sturdy tape or string strips together with cloth to make a wearable apron suitable materials may include sheet metal thick hard plastic pvc etc tough leather kevlar or other tough fibers wear a gas mask if possible for the best odds of escaping riot control agents rcas for short 4 x research source unscathed there s no beating a genuine gas mask however these aren t usually cheap decent quality gas masks will rarely cost less than about 100 125 while replacement filters can easily cost 40 50 per pack 5 x research source don t forget to bring at least one replacement filter canister with you if the current canister starts to fail in the middle of a tear gas attack you ll be glad you brought additional protection note that it is difficult and uncomfortable to perform actions such as running while wearing a gas mask note also that gas masks are subject to export restrictions in some states and countries so check your local laws before traveling with one 6 x research source use a builder s respirator when a gas mask isn t possible if you can t get your hands on a gas mask be prepared with a half face respirator which can usually be found at hardware stores though these don t offer the full face protection of gas masks they should at least make it easier to breathe and in addition they are usually cheaper 7 x research source another reasonable alternative to a gas mask is a device called an escape hood which is essentially a plastic bag with a breathing filter used to protect from smoke inhalation when escaping a fire these are cheaper than gas masks and aren t usually subject to the same regulations use improvised mouth protections as a last resort the drop in quality from professional grade gas masks to lesser solutions is large however any sort of barrier between your face and the rca is better than nothing if you have nothing better handy cover your mouth and nose with a surgical mask a dust mask or even a bandana while these won t protect you from inhaling rcas they may at least provide some protection while you escape wear eye protection but not contacts if you don t have a full face gas mask well fitting eye protection is a must almost all of the rcas that are designed to incapacitate rioters via inhalation will also cause eye irritation pain and even temporary blindness airtight safety goggles are a good bet in terms of eye protection these are often used in chemistry labs and are sometimes sold in college bookstores if you can t find safety goggles even ordinary swimming goggles can work well so long as they can keep an airtight seal 8 x research source be prepared to change clothes tear gas pepper spray and other rcas can seep into your clothes is you re exposed to them directly if this happens the harmful agents will be held against your body and can cause major irritation or even chemical burns to avoid this shed any clothing that is exposed to an rca as soon as you re out of danger you may need to wash your clothes before using them again or discard them depending on how much rca they have been exposed to 9 x research source don t forget that a high end gas mask won t make you invincible against rcas as it will do nothing to protect your clothes consider using hydrophobic sprays such as neverwet to deflect liquids and gasses as well as keep from seeping into your clothes consider bringing gloves one common tactic rioters use to fight against tear gas is to throw the canisters back at the police who shot them however this isn t wise to do with your bare hands as tear gas canisters can get very hot and in addition you ll be exposing your bare skin to the gas itself 10 x research source thus you may want to bring at least a single sturdy glove for dealing with tear gas canisters or just limit yourself to kicking the canisters make a shield for protection beyond what you can get from sturdy clothes and makeshift armor consider building a shield depending on the size thickness and material of your shield it may potentially provide protection for you and others against rubber bullets rocks and batons especially if used in conjunction with others shields ideally a shield should be as hard and sturdy as possible have a u or v shape facing towards your person and have a padded arm strap and grip handle set at a 65 degree angle to make blocking projectiles and strikes as well as supporting the shield easier additionally a second handle on the middle of the shield can be added for an extra sturdy grip this is most effective for deflecting blows from melee weapons as a better form of deflecting projectiles you can use a handle parallel with the ground this handle design is used in heavier ballistic shields that are employed by the police you also may want to add a way to see through the shield but be cautious as an empty hole in the shield large enough for even rubber bullets is dangerous try a metal mesh reinforced with lexan or plexiglass behind it the shield should not be so large or heavy that it makes it hard to move get creative with the canvas that a broad flat shield offers you some protestors involved in the 2014 unrest in ferguson missouri were able to use their plywood shields as protest signs by painting the fronts of the shields with messages and slogans 11 x research source be resourceful and look for things around you that can be effective shields protesters involved in the 2014 anti government riots in the ukraine improvised heavy duty shields made from materials like sheet metal and old iron doors 12 x research source note that lexan is expensive and you may want to opt for less expensive materials sew or tape carbon fiber into your clothing to stop tasers while a single shock from a high powered taser can completely incapacitate even a large man with the right protection it s possible to protect yourself 13 x research source carbon fiber a modern composite material with a wide variety of applications has been found to stop most tasers and stun guns from harming the person on the other side of the fabric however since you can t simply buy a carbon fiber shirt you ll need to add it to your clothes yourself carbon fiber is available commercially in a broad selection of textiles weaves and tapes 14 x research source there are even iron on carbon fiber sheets available which are ideal for adding to existing clothing consider making a homemade tear gas rinse the painful burning sensation from tear gas can be excruciating if you or someone near you gets hit with teargas having something ready to rinse the chemical out of your mouth nose and eyes can be an absolute godsend below are just a few anti rca rinses that are possible to prepare at home some sources state that mixing campden tablets which contain the active ingredient sodium metabisulphate and are used in home brewing with water produces a solution that neutralizes tear gas 15 x research source protesters have been known to use lemon juice milk and other kitchen ingredients to help rinse away tear gas however there haven t been scientific studies to prove whether these are as effective as other solutions 16 x research source when all else fails use clean clear water it s been proven to be fairly effective at treating eye inflammation especially when used generously 17 x research source don t rely on soaked rags or bandanas for teargas protection one common myth is that soaking a bandana or piece of cloth in certain liquids will make it filter or neutralize the chemicals in tear gas this is not supported by scientific evidence 18 x research source below are a few such tricks that you should not count on soaking a bandana in vinegar soaking a bandana in water soaking a bandana in citrus juice rubbing a wet bandana with crushed charcoal don t wear lotions creams etc wearing oil or cream based lotions is a bad idea in a riot these topical products can catch particles of tear gas pepper spray and other rcas holding them against the skin and making it difficult to rinse them off 19 x research source if you need to clean up instead use a simple soap and water rinse don t wear gear that can be perceived as military police related gear that is explicitly police or military surplus can offer lots of protection but it s often a bad idea in a riot for instance if it s too convincing it may trick rioters into thinking that you re actually part of the military or police which depending on the conditions can be very unsafe on the other hand if the police at the riot are eager to attack or arrest rioters this sort of gear can also call unnecessary attention to yourself by being perceived as aggressive or disrespectful don t bring weapons it should go without saying but to be clear it s a bad idea to arm yourself before a protest having a weapon makes you a prime target for the police even if you only intend to use it to defend yourself in martial law situations a weapon may even be reason enough for police to target you with deadly force in short bringing a weapon to a riot makes things much less safe for yourself and the people around you so don t do it,Home-and-Garden
how to prune cilantro,cilantro plants are easy to grow and harvest feel free to trim them whenever you want fresh cilantro either from a small plant at home or from your garden while cilantro plants can produce coriander seeds pruning them regularly will delay this step and maintain your supply of the fresh herb carefully pinch or cut stems off of your plants to avoid damaging them freeze or dry cilantro to preserve it for future cooking adventures,start trimming your cilantro plant once it is 6 inches 15 cm tall cilantro should be pruned often to encourage new growth older larger cilantro leaves also tend to be more bitter in flavor making the herb less desirable if it is left to grow out when your cilantro plant reaches 6 inches 15 cm start trimming away stems to use as needed 1 x research source add fresh cilantro to salads soups salsa guacamole and other dishes it will usually take 60 75 days after planting for your cilantro to be this height pinch or cut cilantro stems off of your plant use your thumb and forefinger to grasp a stem at its outermost leaves trace downwards until your reach a new growth coming in underneath it pinch about 0 4 inches 1 0 cm above the new growth to remove the stem and leaves above it if you prefer use scissors to cut the piece instead of pinching it 2 x research source avoid pulling off stems which could damage the remaining plant keep fresh cilantro in the fridge for a week wrap newly picked cilantro stems or leaves in a clean plastic bag store the bag in the vegetable bin of your refrigerator cilantro will stay fresh and flavorful for up to a week 3 x research source harvest cilantro often throughout the spring and fall cooler months during the springtime and fall are the best to time to pick cilantro from your garden cilantro plants will not grow properly in warmer weather as the heat causes them to seed harvest cilantro early and often to encourage it to keep growing 4 x research source once cilantro plants start to flower and produce coriander seeds they can no longer be harvested these seeds can be dried and used as coriander in recipes though generally only the outer leaves of the plant should be removed leaving the inner leaves to continue to grow a cilantro plant should produce new foliage appropriate for harvesting approximately every week for the duration of its blooming cut stems near the ground level using sharp scissors or garden shears cut the largest leafy stems of your cilantro plants just above the ground stems of fully grown cilantro plants are generally between 6 inches 15 cm and 12 inches 30 cm tall do not cut any stems that are smaller than 6 inches 15 cm 5 x research source harvest no more than 1 3 of each plant to make sure that cilantro plants retain their strength trim no more than 1 3 of their mass when you harvest the herb losing any more of their structure would weaken the plants and possibly stunt their growth assess each plant visually and count the number of large stems growing from them before deciding how many to remove 6 x research source freeze cilantro leaves and stems to store large amount of cilantro leaves and stems wash them and dry them thoroughly lay them flat and place them in a thin layer in a resealable freezer bag or airtight freezer safe container freeze cilantro and keep it for up to a year 7 x research source to use frozen cilantro simply break off as much as you need and put the rest back in the freezer if you are cooking with cilantro use it straight from frozen in your recipe to use the cilantro as a garnish let it thaw in the fridge for 2 3 hours dry cilantro another way of preserving cilantro is to dry it out tie clusters of full cilantro stems together with twist ties and hang them in a warm dry room leave them there for several days until they are completely dried out 8 x research source once the stems are dry you can remove the leaves and crumble them into a small spice jar you can also dry out cilantro leaves by placing them on a baking tray and heating them in the oven at the lowest possible temperature for 30 minutes 9 x research source plant cilantro in the spring or early autumn cilantro thrives in spring and fall weather so these two seasons are the best for planting it avoid planting cilantro in the summer as the heat will cause your plants to flower prematurely this will end your harvesting cycle of cilantro and leave you with bitter tasting leaves 10 x research source place cilantro in a sunny location with partial shade whether you grow cilantro indoors or outdoors plants will need at least some direct sunlight to grow they also need some shade however to keep from overheating too much sun and warmth will cause the plants to go to seed ending their harvest 11 x research source use soil with a ph level between 6 0 and 8 0 if you are planting cilantro in small quantities purchase a potting soil with a neutral ph falling between 6 0 and 8 0 12 x research source if you are planting cilantro in your garden test the soil first with a soil ph test kit if you need to neutralize your soil rake compost into it before planting cilantro 13 x research source plant seeds instead of seedlings it is best to plant cilantro straight from seed as seedlings are delicate and don t fare well when they are transplanted sow the seeds approximately 0 4 inches 1 0 cm into good quality soil seeds can be planted outdoors in rows or indoors in a medium sized container 14 x research source plants will take approximately 2 3 weeks to germinate keep the soil moist avoid overwatering cilantro plants which can overwhelm them give plants about 1 inch 2 5 cm of water per week or just enough to keep the soil moist at all times watch the soil and give the plants more water if it looks dry 15 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to use a hammer safely,a hammer is an easy to use effective tool for all kinds of projects however when using a hammer it is important that you take the necessary safety precautions and use the tool correctly so you don t injure yourself or others ensure you have the right hammer for your job and wear safety glasses to protect your eyes with a bit of preparation and attention to detail you can easily use a hammer without injuring yourself,inspect the hammer before using it to ensure it s in good condition do not use a hammer if it is rusty the wood is splintering or if the head is loose using a hammer that is not in good working order can result in injuries 1 x research source for example if the head of the hammer is loose it can fly off when swinging it if you can use a screwdriver to tighten the nails if not you may have to replace the hammer if the wood is splintered the hammer can break upon impact clean the hammer before you get started if it is dirty if you notice dirt oil or debris on the hammer while you inspect it be sure to wipe it down with a clean cloth if there is oil or debris left on your hammer it may slip out of your hands when using it 2 x research source avoid using water as this can cause the hammer to rust wear safety eyewear to protect against flying items you could injure or lose your eye if a nail or other flying object hits it when you put on the safety glasses make sure your entire eye area is covered and the strap is tightly secured 3 x research source stay focused on what you re doing at all times to prevent injury if you are distracted or daydreaming while working you can wind up hurting yourself by mistake stay present as you work and keep your attention on the hammer this way you are less likely to have an accident 4 x research source if you daydream while working you could wind up hitting your fingers instead of the nails look behind you before you swing the hammer to avoid injuries if you swing the hammer without double checking first you can injure yourself or others passing by before you start banging away take a glance over your shoulder to ensure no one is behind you and that there are no overhanging items 5 x research source for instance look behind you to ensure there are no wires hanging from above that your hammer could catch without peeking behind you you may accidentally hit someone while getting ready to swing the hammer grip the hammer by the end of the handle wrap your fingers around the handle so your thumb sits on top of the shaft this way you can have the most control over your hammer 6 x research source positioning your thumb on top helps you control the amount of force used to drive your item hold the hammer tightly so it doesn t slip out of your hands if your grip is loose the hammer may go flying as you swing it which could injure yourself or the object you re working on squeeze the handle firmly as you use it so the hammer stays in place 7 x research source line up the hammer and item before swinging for an accurate strike to prevent hitting your fingers by mistake line the head of the hammer up to the item before you make your first swing doing this helps you focus your aim ensuring a straight solid strike after you line up the hammer and the item strike it with even force 8 x research source for example hold the nail up to the wall and bring the tip of the hammer over top of the head of the nail start with a light blow before increasing your power if you are hammering a nail into a wall or a board hold the nail to the surface and gently tap the nail with the hammer until it stays in place use light consistent force as you do this so the nail goes in straight and secure after the nail is in place you can use moderate even force to drive the nail the rest of the way in 9 x research source after the nail sets you can move your hand out of the way so it doesn t get whacked this way you can avoid injuring your fingers or using too much force swing the hammer with your entire arm if you aren t driving a nail into the wall grip your hammer from the end ensure you have a tight hold and bring your arm above your head swing the hammer with moderate consistent force using both your arm and elbow 10 x research source for instance do this if you are breaking down drywall or working on a car part use a claw hammer to pound in nails a claw hammer is the most traditional hammer type it features a metal head and it typically has a wooden handle one side of the hammer is used to drive nails into wood and the claw end of the hammer is used to remove nails use this to attach planks hang artwork or do other craftsman jobs 11 x research source the claw section of the hammer is the back pronged part if you need to remove a nail hold the hammer upside down align the claw with the nail and pull up with moderate pressure as you do this be mindful of flying objects 12 x research source claw hammers come in many different shapes sizes and weights some also come in solid metal varieties go for a mallet if doing handwork or assembling furniture parts mallets are a good option if you are working with lightweight items you don t want to damage with excessive force choose from wood mallets or rubber mallets wooden mallets are used to chisel wood or work on the fine detail of woodworking projects rubber mallets work well to deliver a strong blow without much bounce back which makes it great for working on furniture 13 x research source the larger the mallet the greater the swinging power for example use a small rubber mallet to hammer in tent stakes while camping if you need to strike a hard object like a wrench or hammer use a rubber or wooden mallet to do this if you use another metal item to strike a metal object it can result in injury select a ball peen hammer for driving a chisel or punch the ball peen hammer is typically made from solid metal and it has a rounded top great for pounding metals use these to shape metals such as rivets or to reach into small spaces 14 x research source this hammer is commonly used by metalworkers for example if you are trying to reinforce a deck and can t fit your claw hammer into the crevice try using a ball peen hammer instead it has a smaller profile making it great for hard to reach areas try using a sledgehammer if you are working on a demolition site sledgehammers are commonly used for knocking over assemblies or tearing down drywall they often have a long wooden handle and a heavy metal head the head of the sledgehammer is cylindrical and even on both sides 15 x research source sledgehammers are some of the heaviest hammer types weighing about 11 lbs 5 kg so use extra caution when swinging these varieties opt for a body mechanic s hammer if working on automobiles this hammer has a small curved anvil often called the dolly which is made of metal and attached to a wooden handle use this hammer type to remove dents from car panels for example 16 x research source this hammer type is only used for auto work do not use this hammer to drive a nail or you could injure yourself,Home-and-Garden
how to start a garden,do you long to have garden fresh vegetables on your plate every night or to gaze out your window at rows of colorful flowers no matter how large or small your yard might be you can craft a garden plan to fit your needs read on for information on how to plan and start a garden,decide what type of garden to grow what purpose do you want your garden to serve some gardens are functional and produce fruit and vegetables you can use to feed your family or give away to neighbors others are more ornamental in purpose serving to beautify your property and provide a pleasing sight to people passing by 1 x research source if you re not sure what type of garden you want consider the following options vegetable gardens can include peppers tomatoes cabbages and lettuces potatoes squash carrots and many other vegetables if vegetables can grow in your climate you can find a way to grow them in your yard in flower gardens different types of flowers may be strategically planted so that something is in bloom almost all year long some flower gardens are structured with plantings in neat rows and patterns others are wilder in appearance your personal style and yard size will determine what type of flower garden you might plant herb gardens often complement both flower and vegetable gardens since they tend to bloom beautifully while serving the functional purpose of adding flavor to your food herb gardens might include rosemary thyme dill cilantro and a variety of other herbs you may want to use to make dried spices and teas in general vegetable gardens require fertile soil and regular maintenance flowers and herbs can tolerate more neglect and poorer soil decide what specific plants to include in your garden find out what grows well in your area by using this zone finder to determine what zone you are in then research which plants do well in your region as you find out more about your options make a list of the plants you want to buy and the best time of year to plant them 2 x research source some plants don t grow well in certain zones if you live in a place with mild winters and hot summers you may have trouble growing plants that require a cold snap to grow properly unless you plan to make your garden relatively large try to choose varieties that need similar growing conditions do they need the same soil type and sun exposure if not you may have to create a garden with several types of growing conditions which can be challenging in a small garden visit a farmers market or plant sale in the spring often you can learn useful information from vendors and buy healthy plants that grow well in your area choose a spot for your garden take a look around your yard to decide where you want the garden to be the location you choose should help the garden serve its purpose while producing strong healthy plants 3 x research source no matter what type of garden you re planting most plants will grow better in rich well drained soil avoid spots in your yard where water seems to stand for awhile after a heavy rain as this could indicate the soil there is too soggy or clay based for healthy plant growth most vegetables grow best with a lot of sunlight so if you re planting a vegetable garden choose a spot that isn t shaded by trees fences or buildings flowers are more versatile and if you d like a flower plot next to your house you can choose flowers that grow best in partial or full shade if your soil isn t especially fertile you can make a raised bed or beds and grow flowers or vegetables there raised beds are planting beds that are built on top of the ground within wooden frames that are filled with enriched soil 4 x research source if you don t have a yard you can still have a garden plant flowers herbs and certain vegetables in large pots on your patio you can move them around according to the amount of sun the plants need make a garden design draw an outline of your garden or yard space map out different options where you want to plant various items in the location you chose tailor the design to fit the needs of your plants making sure the ones that need shade will be planted in a shady spot and the ones that need full sun are in an area that isn t shaded during the day 5 x research source take into account the space each mature plant will need make sure everything you want to plant will fit in your garden and have enough space to spread out while leaving you room to move around between rows or beds take timing into account planting dates vary with climate zones if you live in a region with mild winters and hot summers for example you ll be able to plant earlier in the year than you would if you lived in a region with cold winters and shorter summers 6 x expert source steve masley professional gardener expert interview 20 march 2020 if you re planting a vegetable garden design it so that it s convenient for you to walk into the garden and harvest vegetables as they ripen you may want to make a path through the garden for this purpose flower gardens should be designed with aesthetics in mind choose colors that look pretty together and make patterns that are pleasing to the eye as you plan keep in mind when different varieties will begin to bloom take your lifestyle into account do you have children or pets who might run through the area is the garden within reach of your water hose is it too close to or too far from your home buy gardening supplies it takes a lot of equipment to plant and maintain a garden but once you buy most of the supplies they should last for years you ll find the best selection at a home and garden store or a nursery gather the following supplies seeds or young plants you can choose either to start your garden from seeds or buy young sprouted plants that already have a head start check the list of plants you intend to grow and buy as many seeds or young plants as you need for the different components of your garden fertilizer and or topsoil bone meal blood meal and other fertilizers help your plants grow healthy and a layer of topsoil is useful to have in case you re planting something that needs extra protection compost you can mix compost into the soil to improve its moisture retention and ph level and provide micro nutrients you can buy compost or make your own mulch many plants would benefit from a layer of mulch leaves grass clippings or other organic matter to protect them from inclement weather or extreme temperatures while they re in the early stages of growth mulch should be spread on top of the soil to help retain moisture and reduce weeds soil tilling equipment if you re planning to create a large garden you might want to buy or rent a soil tiller which is wheeled over the ground to break up the soil and turn it into a soft bed for smaller areas a stiff rake and hoe should be sufficient a shovel and spade these tools make it much easier to dig the proper sized holes for seeds or young sprouts a garden hose get a hose and a nozzle that allow you to either lightly mist or fully spray plants depending on their size if you are planting a large area a sprinkler and perhaps an automatic timer will save you time fencing materials if you re planting a vegetable garden you may need to construct a fence around it to keep rabbits squirrels deer and neighborhood pets from feasting on ripe vegetables prepare the soil use the soil tiller or garden rake to break up the soil in the area you mapped out for your garden work the soil to a depth of about 12 inches 30 5 cm making sure it is loose and does not have large clumps remove rocks roots and other solid objects from the garden bed then fertilize it and work in compost to prepare it for planting how your plants grow depends on the quality of the soil you can buy a soil testing kit to determine how much organic matter and nutrients your soil has as well as its ph level use the results to determine whether you should add more nutrients alternatively you can take a soil sample to a local agricultural extension office for a free or low cost soil test if you re adding commercial fertilizer don t add more than the manufacturer suggests over fertilizing can be toxic to plants note that not all plants like extremely rich soil some actually do better in poor soil so remember to find out the soil preferences of the plants you choose do this with an online search for garden soil requirements if your soil test shows a ph level that is too acidic lower than 7 add limestone to raise the ph if your soil is alkaline ph higher than 7 you can add cottonseed meal sulfur pine bark compost or pine needles to make it more acidic plant the seeds or young plants according to your design use the spade to dig holes spaced a few inches apart or as indicated on the packaging of the seeds or young plants you bought make sure the holes are as deep and wide as they need to be place the seeds or plants in the holes and cover them with soil pat the soil gently into place 7 x expert source steve masley professional gardener expert interview 20 march 2020 fertilize as necessary depending on the plants you choose to grow you may need to fertilize the garden again after planting some plants may need more fertilizer than others so make sure you use it only in the spots that require it 8 x expert source steve masley professional gardener expert interview 20 march 2020 add compost mulch or topsoil as necessary some types of plants require a thin covering of compost mulch or topsoil to protect them during seed germination and while the plant is young and fragile spread the material by hand or use a soil spreader to cover a larger area some types of compost or mulch aren t appropriate for certain plants conduct research on the produce you re growing to make sure you use the right ground cover too thick a layer could inhibit growth so make sure you add only as much as each type of plant needs water the garden when you re finished planting and treating the soil use the garden hose nozzle s sprinkler setting to dampen the garden thoroughly water the garden every day you don t get significant rain adding more or less water to different areas according to the plants needs for the first few weeks after planting 9 x expert source steve masley professional gardener expert interview 20 march 2020 over saturating the soil could drown the seeds and prevent the plants from growing don t water to the point where streams of water run through the garden never let the soil completely dry out watering once a day is sufficient once the plants have sprouted water in the morning rather than at night water sitting on the leaves and stems all night can lead to the production of mold and other plant diseases after a few weeks reduce how often you water the plants give the garden deep waterings two or three times a week or as needed weed the garden sprouting weeds take nutrients from the soil leaving less for your vegetables or flowers weed the garden every few days to make sure your plants get the nutrients they need be careful not to pull up sprouting garden plants a stirrup hoe will help remove weeds before they get too big you can pull the hoe along just below the soil surface between plants to take out the weeds consider erecting a fence if you see wild animals in or near your garden especially deer or rabbits you may want to erect a fence around the garden to protect it a two or three feet fence should be high enough to keep small creatures out if you have deer in your area the fence may need to be as high as eight feet watch for signs of moles or gophers these critters can be an annoyance in a garden see control moles and gophers and related articles,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a war,while almost everyone would like to avoid it people unfortunately experience war every day this is extremely stressful and dangerous but you can deal with the situation if you maintain your focus and take the right steps gather and protect as many supplies as you can find reliable sources of food and water in the event of shortages avoid confrontation as much as you can and move to a safer area if you have to finally learn basic first aid skills to treat any injuries or illnesses you might encounter combined these skills can keep you and your loved ones safe throughout survival situations,move to an area far from fighting if you can unfortunately your home may become unsafe in the event of a war if your area is no longer safe do your best to relocate and find another place to live where you end up settling depends on the progress of the war stay updated on the fighting and try to discern which areas haven t been touched by the war 1 x research source try to find areas that aren t near the main fighting these could be rural areas or strategically unimportant towns there may be designated civilian safe zones set up travel to one of these if there is one nearby rural areas may be safer because fighting is often focused around cities and population centers however remember that you ll need wilderness survival skills to stay safe here it may also be more difficult to receive aid since relief organizations also focus on cities find a strong brick building with a basement for shelter these buildings types can withstand the most damage and remain standing look especially for a building with a basement this provides added protection and a hiding place if you have to stay out of sight search your area for suitable buildings like these and move into one as soon as possible 2 x research source try to find a building that you can seal up in case there is a chemical leak or attack look for windows still intact that you can close and block off with damp towels if there are multiple suitable buildings in your area make a list of all of them and their locations this will help if you have to flee your current shelter and find a new one quickly if there are no buildings like this then find any structure that has a basement to protect you from the fighting build an insulated shelter if you settle in a wooded area if you flee the cities and hide in the woods your biggest enemy will probably be the elements construct a suitable shelter as soon as you enter a new area to protect you from the cold rain and sun maintain this shelter by fixing any problems right away 3 x research source locate the shelter in a spot that s easy to hide in just in case hostile people pass through the area to make the job easier try to build your shelter around an natural feature a fallen tree for example could provide the support for a structure avoid confrontations as much as you can while a war probably makes you think of fighting in reality civilians usually survive a war by avoiding fights as much as possible unless you re in the armed forces in most cases you re much safer avoiding confrontations lay low and don t start fights with people take care of your family friends and yourself but try not to get involved in problems that don t affect you 4 x research source if hostile troops enter your area it s best to hide or avoid interacting with them at all costs make it clear you aren t a threat don t try to steal from people or hurt anyone except in self defense this will lead to confrontations eventually because desperate people will defend themselves avoiding fights may also mean fleeing an area that is unsafe always be ready for this possibility to keep yourself and your loved ones safe learn to use weapons to defend yourself or hunt while you should try to avoid violence always be prepared for the possibility this is much easier if you already have weapons in your home and know how to use them if not then gather any weapons you may find and learn to use them keep them close at hand in your shelter in case you have to use them 5 x research source if you have a gun ammunition might be scarce in a survival situation shooting for practice may also draw attention to you learn to use the gun as well as you can without firing if you ve never used it before don t neglect other potential weapons like bows axes bats or knives these can all help you fight off attackers train other members of your family or group to use the weapons as well your group is at a disadvantage if only one member knows how to fight defend yourself if you have to while you want to avoid violence in some situations fighting may be unavoidable some people try to hurt or exploit others during crises if someone tries to hurt you or your loved ones or steal supplies that you need to survive fight back when you can try to drive off the people who are trying to hurt you 6 x research source having some weapons at hand will help in this situation keep all weapons in a safe place away from children and grab them quickly if you need them if you do have to defend yourself or your family having a good personal relationship with your community is a big help the community could unite to defend itself from bandits or other people who want to cause harm hoard all of your resources and valuable items as soon as war starts there is often little advanced warning about a war breaking out so you may not have the opportunity to stock up on supplies work quickly as soon as you get the news take all of your valuables money food and water and store them safely hide valuables so even if your home is searched they won t be stolen if you re able to go out and get as many supplies as you can don t delay or everything could be gone by the time you need it 7 x research source especially store your canned or wrapped food and bottled water save these resources for emergencies in the event that clean water and fresh food become scarce look for medicine and hygiene products as well these are important for maintaining your health in stressful situations remember to store all of your important documents as well hold onto birth certificates marriage licenses social security cards and any other documents that prove your identification this is especially important if you have to flee your country other countries may prevent you from entering if you can t demonstrate your identity and family relationships withdraw money from the bank to have cash on hand you may not have access to your bank electronically locate a clean water source water is the most important resource for humans and clean water may become scarce in wartime bottled water sources will only last so long as soon as the war starts find all of the potential water sources in your area do the same for every new area you move into 8 x research source nearby lakes and streams are potential water sources but you may have to purify the water before drinking it if you live near the ocean do not drink saltwater it s difficult to resist but saltwater will cause serious illness if you do find a clean water source use that and try to preserve your bottled water for emergencies if no other water sources are near you collect rainwater for drinking and bathing leave out buckets and tubs to catch the rain when it falls remember to purify all rainwater before you drink it gather canned and nonperishable food items your regular supply of food may be interrupted so nonperishable items are essential once you get news that war has broken out gather as many canned and nonperishable items as you can get them from the store or any other source you come across this ensures you ll have a steady supply if food starts running out 9 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source after the war has been going on canned items may be available in abandoned grocery stores whenever you find an unopened can take it you don t know when you ll come across more food try to avoid foods with high salt content that will make you thirsty these will make you drink more water than you would normally ideally you should have 3 days worth of nonperishable food in your home at all times in case of natural disasters or other emergencies if you have a stockpile already you can avoid the rush to the food store that will occur once the war starts learn to hunt and fish for extra sources of meat if food becomes unreliable you ll be at an advantage if you know how to hunt and fish work on your tracking and hunting skills to find other sources of meat also practice fishing for a steady supply of nutritious fish both skills can help you get through times of food shortage 10 x research source learn how to properly skin bleed and dress an animal so the meat doesn t go bad before you can eat it 11 x trustworthy source penn state extension educational organization dedicated to delivering science based information to people businesses and communities go to source you don t have to be in a rural area to hunt there are plenty of animals in city settings try setting up traps to catch small animals stockpile hygiene products if you find them while hygiene may not be high on your list in a survival situation it is more important than you may think practicing good hygiene can prevent illness and infection and also help you feel better when you re gathering supplies always include as many hygiene products as you can carry also look for more if you re scrounging or searching for supplies 12 x research source important hygiene products to have are toilet paper hand sanitizer toothpaste and toothbrush soap or liquid soap feminine products and disinfectant less critical but important products include combs or brushes razors shaving cream and deodorant these won t necessarily save your life but keeping up a good appearance can help you feel much better in stressful situations determine which plants in your area are edible almost all areas have local plants that may be edible knowing which ones you can eat could save your life in a desperate situation study your local area and find the plants that are edible then gather them regularly for a steady supply of food 13 x research source if you don t know what a plant is or if it s edible smell it first if the smell is terrible it s a good bet that it s not edible then hold the plant on your skin for 15 minutes and see if you feel any itching or burning if not place the plant on your lips for 15 minutes then take a small bite of the plant if you don t feel any burning or stomach pains after 15 minutes then the plant is probably safe to eat if possible you could also start a garden on your property for extra produce try to keep this hidden though if food is short people will almost certainly try to steal your produce avoid wasting anything all resources are precious in wartime so preserve everything you can reuse old rags to make clothes use food scraps to make stock catch rainwater don t let anything go to waste 14 x research source loot supplies if you have no other choice unfortunately people sometimes have to do desperate things to survive if you come across supplies or stores that no one is watching or look abandoned then take everything you need this might be ethically wrong but you and your family have to survive 15 x research source if you live in a populated area you may come across many abandoned stores don t hesitate to search them for supplies and take what you need if you re on the move stop and check any buildings you come across you never know what the previous residents left behind don t try to steal food or supplies that people area guarding however you could end up injured or killed for this learn basic first aid to treat minor injuries injuries are unfortunately inevitable and they can range from minor to serious develop at least a basic knowledge of first aid to treat the injuries you or a partner may encounter when searching for supplies take any first aid gear you may find and build a basic first aid kit 16 x research source wash all wounds with clean water only never use dirty or unfiltered water keep all wounds covered with clean bandages if possible replace the bandage with a clean one regularly learning cpr can also save someone s life in an emergency situation stay away from any weapons and ordnance you come across unexploded mines bombs and other ordnance are a major cause of civilian injuries and death in war if you re near a fighting zone there may be dangerous materials strewn out everywhere don t touch anything at best you could give yourself a cut at worst this could be an unexploded weapon that could seriously injure you 17 x research source keep yourself clean to avoid infections while it may be difficult washing yourself regularly is an important way to stay healthy take quick showers if running water is still available if not then use one of your water capture methods to gather enough water to clean yourself 18 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source try catching some rainwater in a bucket then dip a towel in that bucket and rub some soap on it run the towel around your body then rinse with the rainwater try not to waste your bottled water on bathing you can use unfiltered water for bathing unless you have open wounds in this case purify the water purify any water you drink that isn t from a sealed bottle a waterborne illness can be life threatening in a survival situation if need to use any unbottled water for drinking always purify it first the most common method is boiling the water for 1 minute to kill any pathogens then filter out larger objects by pouring the water through a fine net or cloth 19 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source it isn t always obvious if a water source is contaminated boil all water from streams and rivers anyway just as a precaution if you re desperate you may be tempted to drink unclean water to quench your thirst do not under any circumstances drink dirty water without purifying it you could contract a disease or parasite that may be fatal eat as healthy as you can this isn t always possible and you have to survive on whatever food you can find but if at all possible keep your health up with nutritious food a steady supply of vitamins minerals antioxidants and fatty acids will help keep your immune system up and fight off sickness 20 x trustworthy source

intake these may be available from abandoned stores and homes stay updated on news about the war information is critical to surviving a war monitor the progress of the war to find out which areas are safe or dangerous and where you might find resources this information may be scarce but there are methods you can use to stay informed 22 x research source social media is a great new way to stay informed check for updates on twitter and facebook from residents of other areas use certain keywords or hashtags to find the information you re looking for handheld battery powered radios may also be a reliable information source see if you can pick up any local news stations reporting on the war question any outsiders who pass through your area for information ask where they came from and if they have any news keep up personal relationships with family and neighbors these personal relationships will help you get through the crisis having family members around helps to ease your stress protecting them also gives you a purpose which can drive you to push yourself harder in stressful situations a network of neighbors can also share food and resources so treat the people around you

how to evacuate a building in an emergency,when an emergency such as a fire flood or gas leak breaks out you need to be prepared to evacuate whether at school in the workplace or in any other public space it is important to have an established evacuation plan that you can follow closely in times of emergency create an evacuation plan and follow it in emergency situations to help you get out of a building quickly and as safely as possible plan your evacuation in advance taking note of the nearest exits for different groups when it comes time to evacuate do so sooner rather than later and always follow the instructions of the emergency response team,check evacuation plans office buildings hotels restaurants and other commercial spaces often have pre established evacuations plans and procedures check with building management to find out about the evacuation protocol if you are in this type of building 1 x research source look for evacuation maps on building doors and in public areas such as lobbies and stairwells if you are looking for evacuation plans for your office check with your manager or the company head regarding current evacuation plans and what roles different people are to fill during an emergency identify safe escape routes find routes that will get people out of the building with the least risk during an evacuation look at your building plans to help people find the exits nearest to them and create an evacuation plan that takes people to their nearest exit quickly and safely 2 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source try to avoid potential hazards such as going through kitchens or areas with large windows these pose an excess risk as lines in kitchens can break and exacerbate emergencies while windows may blow out and cause increased risk due to glass be sure to avoid mechanical transportation such as elevators as these could fail and put people at an increased risk use stairwells whenever possible mark your routes provide clear markers for people to guide people to exits from the building post evacuation maps throughout the building and mark exits with clear exit signs in spaces that do not get much natural light such as interior hallways you may also want to consider placing photoluminescent strips along the sides of the floors to help guide people to the nearest exit inform others make sure other people using the building know about the evacuation plan help them identify their nearest exit and tell them about safety precautions such as avoiding elevators it may also be helpful to appoint safety monitors to help guide others in the event of an evacuation if you are dealing with a large space that holds a great number of people assess the situation if possible find out why you are evacuating before you leave the building knowing why an evacuation has been called can help you modify your plan if necessary to best accommodate the circumstances 3 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source if for example there is a fire that blocks your nearest exit you know to go in the opposite direction of the fire even if another exit is further away if there is an active threat such as a bomb threat or an armed person spotted seek instructions from authorities such as the police or fire department before attempting to evacuate proceed quickly to an exit once you know you are to evacuate proceed quickly to your nearest exit do try to avoid panicking as panic can quickly disorganize a group slow down the evacuation process and put more people in danger 4 x research source do not worry about gathering belongings that are not immediately within reach taking time to pack a bag or go to another room once an evacuation has been called is dangerous take only what is already on your person or already packed and within arm s reach if possible exit through your nearest clearly marked exit sign if a standard exit truly is not accessible look for other ways out of the building such as through a window do not use the elevators elevators in evacuations are reserved for use by emergency personnel using elevators also puts your life at risk as the elevator may fall stop malfunction or otherwise fail to work if you have a disability that does not allow you to go down the stairs call 911 report your location and wait for emergency personnel at the designated area of rescue assistance depending on the building there may be evacuation chairs that can be deployed by wheelchair companions get some distance once you have exited the space make sure to put a safe distance between you and the building depending upon the situation authorities may have set up a do not cross line to indicate a safe distance consider whether there is a designated meeting place outlined in your evacuation plan if you are supposed to meet with others in a designated area proceed directly to that area think about how much space is necessary for different types of emergencies an emergency such as an electrical problem in the building likely requires less space than something like a fire consider how much space you need based on the reason for evacuation check in with responders once you are a safe distance away from the building check in with the authorities or emergency responders to let them know you re safe and see what your next steps need to be this is also the time to let someone know if you have been injured during evacuation 5 x research source if no authorities or first responders are present call the police or fire department as appropriate to warn them of potential threats and receive further instruction get clearance before you reenter the building make sure you get clearance from emergency responders that the building is safe and whatever threat caused the evacuation has been contained do not reenter a building that has not been inspected by the proper authorities 6 x research source if you were sent away after an evacuation call to check in with the building manager or local authorities to make sure the space is safe to re enter let them know we had to evacuate because of an emergency and we would like to know if it is safe to reenter the space additionally it may be helpful to ask are there any precautions we should take when going back into the space for the first time assess any damage if physical damage was done to the space take careful note of what damage occurred and what may be harmed or missing report any damage to the building manager or to the authorities and your insurance if you own the building 7 x research source in addition to noting damaged items note anything that seems lost or stolen take photographs or videos of the damage as well as thorough notes in case it is necessary for you to file an insurance claim update evacuation plans take this evacuation experience as an opportunity to work out kinks in your plan check with others if possible to see if there were obstacles or moments when the evacuation was slowed or stalled and update your plan accordingly if an evacuation was particularly slow look for alternative routes or consider dividing people up more evenly among exits recap with the evacuated group to address any problems that you saw and suggest improvements for the future,Home-and-Garden
how to fix sinkholes,sinkholes develop when soft rock underground e g limestone gypsum or other carbonate rock wears away over time this is known as karst terrain eventually the unsupported sediment above the underground hole collapses leaving the sinkhole open 1 x research source typically property owners don t realize that their houses are built on karst terrain and so sinkholes appear unexpectedly and without warning to fill a sinkhole you ll first need to pour a concrete plug in the bottom of the hole then fill the rest of the sinkhole with clay sand and top it off with a layer of topsoil,monitor the hole to see if it grows sinkholes are often triggered by weather phenomena such as a heavy rainstorm once a sinkhole has formed though it can continue to grow as further portions of limestone or other carbonate rocks fall away as long as a sinkhole continues to grow on a day by day basis do not attempt to fill it in 2 x research source once the sinkhole has stopped growing and remained the same size for a few days you can fill it in probe the size and depth of the sinkhole only relatively small shallow sink holes can be filled by homeowners take a pole or stick even a tree branch would do and probe around in the sinkhole note how deep and wide it is 3 x research source exercise caution when walking around the edge of the sinkhole the ground can be very unstable so take care not to fall do not attempt to fill in a sinkhole larger than 3 feet 0 91 m in diameter 4 x research source large sinkholes can be deep and potentially dangerous if the sinkhole is deeper than chest height do not step down inside of it deep sinkholes and holes with steep walls pose a high risk of collapse 5 x research source call a professional landscaping company if you re concerned about working in and around a sinkhole or if you think that the sinkhole is too large for you to fill it s time to call professionals use internet resources to find a local landscaping company and explain that you re hoping to have a sinkhole on your property filled in 6 x research source landscaping companies will have more experience in dealing with this phenomenon than the average homeowner when dealing with very large sinkholes you ll need to contact local authorities in the city or county in which the sinkhole has appeared dig out the outer edges of the sinkhole the sinkhole may be larger underground than it appears on the surface to determine the true extent of the sinkhole use a shovel to expand the size of the sinkhole remove the sod around the edges of the sinkhole and make sure the surrounding ground is solid continue to remove the edges of the hole until you reach a point at which the topsoil and sediment are supported by solid rock 7 x research source also remove any loose debris that may be in the sinkhole tree branches pinecones etc mix dry concrete powder with water start out by pouring about a third of the concrete mix into a large basin such as a wheelbarrow pour in about 1 us quart 946 ml of water and mix thoroughly with a hoe shovel or paddle mixer continue to add water until the concrete is wet throughout and a heavy putty consistency add gravel for increase the strength of the concrete 8 x research source you can buy 80 pound 36 kg bags of quick mixing concrete at your local hardware store or home supply store the size and depth of the sinkhole will determine how much concrete you need to mix pour a concrete plug in the sinkhole using the wheelbarrow and the shovel pour wet concrete into the bottom of the sinkhole this will prevent the sinkhole from deepening further and will give a solid base to the subsequent materials you use to fill the hole 9 x research source aim to fill at least a quarter of the hole with concrete so if the sinkhole is 4 feet 1 2 m deep fill it with 1 foot 0 3 m of concrete you do not need to let the concrete dry before you move on to filling the hole with sand and soil a plug simply means that you ll fully fill the bottom of the sinkhole with concrete add clay sand on top of the concrete plug thick clayey sand will provide a heavy filling for the sinkhole which prevents water from collecting in the re filled sinkhole using your shovel scoop the sand out of a wheelbarrow or truck bed and deposit it into the hole 10 x research source fill the hole with sand until it s about ¾ full sand can be purchased at most large hardware stores home supply stores or landscape supply stores if none of these venues sell clayey sand contact a building contractor in your area most contracting companies will have a sand supplier that they may put you in touch with fill the hole with topsoil fill whatever depth remains to the sinkhole with topsoil this will bring the materials you used to fill the hole up to the level of the surrounding yard or terrain finishing the hole with topsoil will also allow plants to grow on top of the former sinkhole and stabilize the soil and sand 11 x research source topsoil can be purchased by the bag at any gardening center or home supply store top off the hole with more soil in a few days over time the sand and topsoil that you ve added to the sinkhole will compact and settle this will leave open room at the top of the sinkhole again use the rest of the topsoil to fill in the hole until it s once again at the level of the surrounding terrain 12 x research source repeat this process more than once if necessary the materials filling the sinkhole are likely to settle following heavy rain or runoff avoid planting trees or shrubs over the sinkhole as the may not thrive due to a lack of nutrients in the soil they could also become uprooted or fall if the hole collapses again,Home-and-Garden
how to install a swag hook,swag hooks are often used to support plants and light fixtures that hang by a chain installing a swag hook can be tricky but here s what you need to know how to do it right and ensure that it stays put it s important to remember that the swag hook itself will probably support more weight than you d ever consider putting on it but the hardware the hook is secured with and materials it is secured to will give out much sooner,consider the weight of the object hung by the hook if swag hook should fall will someone get hurt or will an expensive piece of furniture etc be damaged if a plant consider how much heavier it will become after watering and if over watered will the overflow damage electrical electronic devices below 1 x research source determine installation hardware to be used based on support material a typical hook will have a threaded hole and be provided with inserts that thread into this hole one insert will be threaded with fine threads on one end and wider threads and a point at the other end this insert is designed to be used when screwed directly into wood or plastic anchor some times called a molly that has been pressed into a drilled hole in brick concrete etc not wallboard an other insert is a 2 or 3 or longer inch threaded rod threads running the entire length lacking a point it is works with a spring loaded wing like nut and is called a toggle or sometimes a butterfly nut many manufacturers include them for different uses and identify them for use in wallboard they are actually designed for use in hollow walls constructed of durable materials such as cinder block they have better success when used in vertical wallboard installations for light loads but use in ceilings should be discouraged except the very lightest loads 2 x research source to support a fixture or plant from a ceiling the only method for safely installing a swag hook should be apparent as the type secured into wood 3 x research source locate wood strapping or joists in the ceiling nearest the desired location with a commercially available stud finder follow the instructions included for proper use 4 x research source select a drill bit small enough that the resulting hole will be smaller than the thickness of the pointed end insert this is done by holding the threaded insert behind the drill bit the threads should be fully visible from behind the bit select a smaller rather than larger bit it is most important that not too much material be removed from the hole so that the threads can grab larger holes provide less gripping strength than smaller holes drill in the center of the strapping where found previously with the stud finder to a depth just longer than the pointed end threaded portion of the insert approx 2 thread the non pointed end insert into the swag hook twist the swag into the freshly drilled hole until the flange or base of the hook is pressed tightly against the ceiling once secured fully into the ceiling apply downward pressure greater than the weight of the fixture plant on the hook to test the pull out strength if the swag pulls out verify the location of the strapping with the stud finder again and drill another hole with a smaller drill bit nearby and reinstall the swag repeat until the swag does not pull out additional swags used to support the chain and power cord of a light fixture may be supported with the toggle bolt anywhere desired as this weight is a small fraction of the fixture 5 x research source check for the presence of strapping or joists with the stud finder where additional swags are desired if present repeat the above procedure where needed if no studs wall installation or strapping or joists ceiling are present the toggle method can be used this method requires that the threaded rod be installed into the the swag and the the toggle nut is spun only so far that the threaded rod protrudes out of the end by about two or three threads the toggle nut should be installed so that the wings can be depressed against the threaded rod towards the base of the swag hook this same method is used to suspend objects from hooks in the ceiling when using this method for ceiling installations only the lightest loads or ornamental type loads should be considered as this support method is the least robust 6 x research source while holding the wings against the threaded rod determine the diameter of a hole that would be required to push the toggle nut through holes 1 2 or greater are not uncommon 7 x research source drill into the ceiling only deep enough to penetrate the wallboard squeeze the toggle nut wings against the threaded rod and press the toggle nut into the hole completely press the swag against the ceiling to ensure that the wings have popped open twist the swag hook clockwise while gently pulling downward twist the swag until the flange or base is firmly pressed against the ceiling repeat for as many swags as needed hang the fixture freshly watered plant on the swag hook keeping hands just underneath it so it may be caught should the load prove greater that the capacity of the swag hook hardware or mount method once satisfied the load can be safely held connect any chain power cord through any additional swags check the swag regularly for indications of impending failure bulging or cracking of ceiling around hook and if found take corrective action at once,Home-and-Garden
how to prevent a robbery,in today s tough economy home invasions are sadly becoming more real people are losing their items and many may never see them again if you don t want your house robbed this guide will show you some easy steps you can take to prevent a break in,try using an alarm system they are a great idea and getting one isn t very hard and usually not expensive these alarms can be a great deterrent for burglars make sure however that it is professionally installed ensure that the alarm works by checking it regularly 1 x research source if you are unable to buy an alarm system placing stickers or signs that announce the presence of an alarm is a smart move they are available for free or at low prices from many security companies locking doors and windows are a good measure unlocked doors and windows make it easy for someone to rob your house if a lock doesn t work get it fixed immediately it is recommended that you buy a deadbolt lock preferably one that is high quality they are available for purchase at most hardware stores also consider getting a hardwood or reinforced door if you live in a high crime area 2 x research source destroy boxes as strange as it may seem people may want to rob you for what is on a box at the end of your driveway if you have a box that shows a plasma screen tv or something else very expensive you want to get rid of it 3 x research source leave lights on if you re leaving if a house looks vacant and unprepared that house may be a victim of a robbery leaving lights on is a safe measure for any house this can be done by setting up a timer to your lights to turn them on at specific times set them to realistic periods such as in the evening and not very late at night doing this will prevent suspicion 4 x research source trust your neighbors if you re going to be gone for a while neighbors can help protect your house you can give a spare key to your neighbors if you have a good relationship with them and can trust them to have your back in case of an emergency your neighbors can also report any suspicious activity if they see it 5 x research source close your garage leaving it open even during the day puts your car and its contents at risk from strangers passing your house be especially vigilant about closing it at night if you see your neighbors garage open after bedtime call them to let them know they will appreciate the call and likely return the favor if you inadvertently leave your garage open 6 x research source keep things put away and out of sight if possible so a snooping stranger can t see valuables through windows this goes for your car as well install thick curtains for your windows and make sure to close them when you are not home you may want to buy a cover for your car if necessary or leave your valuables out of sight use double dead bolt if you have glass next to your outside doors use a double dead bolt so they can t reach in though broken glass and unbolt the door keep a key for the deadbolt inside the house near the door at all times so you can escape easily in case of a fire 7 x research source plant thorny bushes near windows that may be vulnerable to break in it will deter thieves examples of such bushes are many types of roses as well as holly plants roses and holly both look nice and have sharp thorns to prevent robbers from breaking in make sure to trim the plants whenever necessary 8 x research source eliminate tall shrubs near doors and windows they may allow thieves to be concealed from watchful neighbors as they attempt to break into your home this especially holds true if you are going to be away from your house for a while thick and unkempt shrubbery is a clear giveaway that you are not home and haven t been for a while be certain to secure windows into your garage for sliding windows use channel locks that clamp on or a stick that keeps the window from sliding open once in your garage thieves have many opportunities to break into your house using your own tools from the garage and unfortunately once in your garage often the door leading into your home is unlocked so lock it with a dead bolt and keep it locked when you are gone or asleep secure upper story windows especially doors to decks or balconies these can often be reached by athletic youth or experienced thieves seeking easy access into your home if you live in an area with a high crime rate you may want to install metal bars over your windows metal bars will essentially eliminate most threat of burglars breaking in through an upper story window 9 x research source add exterior lighting to your home so that visitors are in plain sight of your neighbors when approaching your home leave them on when you are gone or put them on motion sensors and or light sensors so they are on at dusk and or when someone approaches your house 10 x research source park your vehicle in a lit area if you have to park your vehicle outside park in a well lit area and keep it locked you may want to invest in a car alarm as well use a pedal jack to ensure that no one can drive away with your vehicle 11 x research source don t keep a key to your house hidden outside your house never leave a spare key under the doormat or in a plant pot most thoughtful thieves will find a hidden key if they have time to search if you have to keep a key outside your home keep it at a neighbors house you could even keep it hidden in a lockbox outside their house if you are concerned about them being unavailable when you need your key 12 x research source choose the right security code if you have a keypad garage door opener installed outside your home be smart about the code don t use a number that could be looked up by a determined thief avoid birthdays addresses phone numbers or sequenced or repetitive numbers it is okay not best but okay to combine numbers such as the first two digits of your phone number plus the month you were born or you could use two digits from your mom s birthday and two digits from your dad s birthday don t share this code with anyone but your immediate family stay aware be cautious about workers and contractors working at your house or your neighbor s house if you have valuable equipment or tools put them out of sight out of mind for a few it may be tempting to help themselves to your stuff or tell a friend where there are some valuable items to be lifted at a later date,Home-and-Garden

how to make synthetic gasoline,increasing prices concerns over supplies and suppliers and environmental worries make the notion of creating your own synthetic gasoline very appealing it is scientifically possible to create fuel for gasoline powered engines out of materials like wood pellets or organic trash but the costs explosive dangers and specialty equipment and skills needed put such methods beyond the abilities of most people therefore making synthetic fuel is likely just a diy dream but if you re still interested in trying start by getting a handle on the basics,search online for fema gasifier to find an essential guide in 1989 the u s federal emergency management agency fema published a guide called construction of a simplified gas generator for fueling internal combustion engines in an emergency this document has become the go to guide for skilled diyers who want to try their hand at creating synthetic gasoline out of wood pellets or chips find a good pdf or similar electronic copy at sites like http www driveonwood com static media uploads pdf fema_plans pdf https www pssurvival com ps gasifiers fema_simplified_wood_gas_generator mar_1989_with_biomass_energy_foundation_2001 pdf http www dtic mil dtic tr fulltext u2 a208249 pdf also download the handbook of biomass downdraft gasifier engine systems at https www nrel gov docs legosti old 3022 pdf get a handle on how gasification works section i of the fema guide provides a wealth of background information on the history and science behind the process known as gasification it points out for example that all combustion including in internal combustion engines involves vapor and that it is therefore possible to filter and isolate combustible vapor from burning biomass such as wood pellets 1 x research source biomass gasifiers don t create liquid fuel only combustible vapors however it s important to remember that internal combustion engines vaporize liquid fuel anyway section i also presents an interesting historical account of the process including how widespread the use of biomass gasification was in europe during world war ii follow the step by step instructions if you want to try building a system fema created this guide for use by americans during crises in which gasoline supplies might be cut off so the biomass gasifier it describes uses widely available parts such as a metal trash can and sections of piping however that doesn t mean building the gasifier is an easy job that everyone can handle 2 x research source in basic terms the wood pellets or shavings are burned in one chamber of the gasifier the smoke is filtered through more wood pellets shavings in a second chamber and the filtered vapor is mixed with air as it enters the intake valve of the internal combustion engine you re using fire to create combustible vapors so it s essential that you follow the directions very closely and take every recommended safety precaution you may also benefit by watching online videos that show diyers building gasifiers based on the fema plan such as https youtu be a6e3cprvti8 t 220 power motor vehicles or a generator with a completed gasifier system the fema guide shows you how to attach the gasifier to a standard farm tractor and use it to power its engine with wood shavings in theory you could use the same principles to power a typical automobile in an emergency situation this wouldn t be street legal under normal circumstances though 3 x research source in reality this type of gasifier is probably more useful as a way to power a gas fueled generator which in turn can generate electricity for your home this way you can keep the lights on in your home with little more than some scrap wood 4 x research source learn how fischer tropsch creates liquid fuel out of biomass in very basic terms the fischer tropsch process adds high temperature high pressure and a heavy metal catalyst like iron or cobalt to the typical biomass gasification process as a result it can be used to create liquid synthetic gasoline out of biomass like wood pellets or organic trash 5 x research source the high heat and pressure convert the biomass into a mix of carbon dioxide and hydrogen at which point impurities can be filtered out then the introduction of a heavy metal catalyst turns the carbon dioxide and hydrogen into long chain hydrocarbons that are cooled and condensed into a liquid accept fischer tropsch s limitations as a diy project fischer tropsch has great diy appeal because unlike biomass gasification that produces a combustible vapor for immediate use it produces liquid fuel that can be stored and used as needed however while it s theoretically possible to replicate using widely available materials creating a fischer tropsch converter is likely beyond the capabilities of most people 6 x research source it relies on temperatures of at least 300 c 572 f and preferably 1 000 c 1 830 f and pressures of up to tens of atmospheres this makes it extremely challenging and dangerous due to the risk of an explosion if you don t have advanced mechanical and scientific knowledge get detailed plans and expert assistance if you wish to proceed if you re eager to try building a fischer tropsch converter research it thoroughly and study several conceptual designs 7 x research source if you re not a mechanical engineer you ll almost certainly need to find one to help you construct the converter you may also need to check with local authorities to see if this is legal to build where you live while the basic building materials are widely accessible things like steel piping pressure gauges etc you need expert precision and knowledge to build a fischer tropsch converter effectively and safely putting combustible materials under high pressure creates a major risk for explosions if the converter isn t built and maintained properly don t expect to save money on fuel this way a fischer tropsch converter lets you create liquid synthetic gasoline out of widely available materials like wood chips so it is potentially valuable in an emergency situation however for general use it is far more expensive to create fuel this way than to purchase typical gasoline 8 x research source so unfortunately this isn t a magic bullet replacement for gasoline derived from crude oil fischer tropsch fuels however do burn cleaner and create less environmental pollution than standard gasoline research the process of distilling ethanol at home ethanol fuel is nothing more than distilled alcohol so essentially if you can learn to make moonshine you can learn to make a gasoline alternative with some good plans and a bit of diy know how you can build a simple still out of items like an old hot water tank and some conduit piping and produce ethanol yourself 9 x research source home production of ethanol on a small scale under roughly 5 000 us gal 19 000 l is legal in the u s but check with your local authorities for any restrictions where you live take the time to find good plans for building a still and consider working with someone experienced with the process heat and pressure are utilized to create ethanol and these can be dangerous with improperly constructed equipment look into buying an all in one home ethanol maker if building a still and making your own ethanol moonshine style isn t your thing you may have other options search online for companies that produce and sell ethanol fuel makers with one of these machines all you really need to do is add sugar yeast and water push a button and wait for it to produce ethanol for you 10 x research source these machines can be the size of a stacked washer and dryer and may include a pump for direct fueling into cars etc however expect to pay around 10 000 usd for one of these machines also depending on the cost of the raw materials namely sugar producing ethanol this way may cost more than filling up your car with traditional gasoline don t add straight ethanol to a standard internal combustion engine if you want to power your car lawnmower etc on ethanol you need to blend it with at least 15 gasoline first otherwise you risk damaging your engine however if you have a modern flex fuel vehicle you can fill it up with straight ethanol 11 x research source it s also possible to convert a standard engine so it can run on straight ethanol for a car engine this involves things like resetting the ignition timing and rejetting the carburetor unless you re knowledgeable in auto repair you ll need a mechanic to make these changes 12 x research source,Home-and-Garden

emergency situation use your phone to call your family members before your phone dies since you won t be able to charge it after the battery runs out keep some entertainment on hand because you won t be able to use your tv computer or any other electronic item you will need to find some entertainment for yourself however its good to keep in mind that you shouldn t waste your flashlight s batteries by shining it on a book at night if you have lanterns or candles set one up at a table so that everyone can gather around it to read play games or talk invest in some alternative light sources these include multiple flashlights camping lanterns and candles store your flashlights where you can find them quickly in the dark candles are great because they last a long time without wasting battery life lanterns are especially useful when trying to go about daily life in the dark illuminate your kitchen with a lantern while you cook determine what you will do for heat if you have a fireplace it would be a good idea to stockpile wood close off rooms that are not being used because what little heat you do have will spread out throughout the house you could also consider investing in a kerosene heater while these heaters will warm the house they must be placed near a vent or else they could lead to carbon monoxide build up 8 x research source use your car to charge necessary electronics if you can get outside to your car you may want to charge your more absolutely necessary electronics such as cell phones for contacting family members and rechargeable flashlights you can charge your electronics through your cigarette lighter in your car which is connected to the cars battery keep perishables in your fridge cold the best way to do this is by purchasing a block of dry ice wrapping it in newspaper and placing it in your refrigerator find out where you can purchase dry ice today so you know where to go in case of an emergency 9 x research source open your fridge and freezer only when absolutely necessary you can also cover your fridge and freezer with thick blankets to keep the temperature inside down make sure the blankets do not cover your fridge or freezer vents cook perishable foods first before you dive into the non perishable foods you have stocked up on consider cooking the perishable food you have left in your refrigerator only do this on the first day of the blackout as most refrigerated food should not be eaten after it has been sitting in temperatures above 40ºf 4 4ºc for longer than two hours exceptions to this rule are hard cheeses processed cheese fresh fruits and vegetables butter margarine and bread 10 x research source cook on your gas stove if you are lucky enough to have a gas stove during a power outage then you should be fine when it comes to cooking your food you will have to light the ranges by hand but other than that you should be good to go if however you have an electric stove alternative cooking methods are listed below 11 x research source never use your gas stove or oven to heat your house these appliances are not meant to do that and will cause a dangerous increase in the amount of carbon monoxide in your house break out the propane and butane camp stoves or use your grill if you have a camping stove and can t cook on your electric range then its time you blew the dust off that propane or butane can these camping stoves essentially work the same as a regular gas stove grills and barbecues will also work in a power outage just make sure you don t use them inside or else they could cause carbon monoxide build up which can be very dangerous be ready to make a fire if you have to if you have a fireplace use it if you don t you may need to make a campfire in your backyard if you are living in an area that is

how to clear a building with a firearm,clearing or searching a building when someone may be in it who also may have a weapon is a very dangerous task and should not be taken lightly police and military have training for such circumstances but the normal citizen is usually less than knowledgeable on the subject although the authorities should always be contacted in the event of a suspected break in knowing how to clear the building yourself may help you to keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the event that help cannot arrive in time this article for the purpose of simplification will assume you are in your house,choose an appropriate firearm exploring your house for that unidentified sound in the night or to going to the aid of a loved one with empty hands is not a smart idea equipping yourself is therefore important the three main categories of firearms are pistols handguns shotguns and rifles the very first step is to intimately familiarize yourself with firearm safety rules for example be sure of your target and what s beyond it don t shoot your teenage son sneaking back into the house also remember that most likely the bullets you are firing will go through the walls in your house and could therefore strike loved ones 1 x research source consider tactically preparing yourself with a pistol for suggestions on arming yourself with a pistols pistols are a lightweight efficient and popular choice for personal defense an alternative and highly recommended firearm to have would be a pump action shotgun shotguns have much better stopping power than a pistol a pump action is recommended as reliability is of the utmost importance but you can also use break action shotguns to good effect don t be fooled by those who say that shotguns are point and shoot shotguns take as much training and practice as pistols and rifles rifles are the third common option rifles again produce even in some smaller calibers significantly more stopping power than most pistols but they require just as much precision a magazine fed semi automatic rifle is the suggested choice as two hands may not always be available and the option to quickly shoot multiple rounds is often a welcome one choose different sizes or gauges depending on effect for pistols the largest pistol possible is recommended for the best stopping power and controllability while for a rifle or shotgun from now on they will be called long guns the shortest length possible is preferred these preferences are obviously within reason as a 4 foot long freak pistol or a 12 inch long long gun are impractical and defy the intended use of the specific weapons 2 x research source decide your course of action before you do anything if you are the only one in the house or everyone in the house is in the room you are in then your choices are much easier if you are sure there is a very unwelcome guest in your house call the local police lock the door to your bedroom and any other entrances if available and be prepared do not move wait for the police to come do not approach the police with a firearm in your hand be sure to holster it or set it down once the police are in your immediate vicinity 3 x research source the reason why you wait in this situation is because searching a house is very dangerous and nothing other than loved ones should be worth dying over plus insurance should cover any stolen or damaged items know what s in store if you decide to search and clear this should only be done if you know an intruder is in your house and you have loved ones elsewhere in the house be sure you call the police before you take any actions and be sure to tell them you are armed and that you are going to try to retrieve or protect your loved one s the other situation in which you might need to use these techniques is if you are unsure about an intruder and you wish to make sure there is no danger in this case you should also arm yourself with a cell phone as you may need to call the police while not near a land line approach the corner the most common object in a house is a corner and the most common solution for an object is the same as clearing a corner the process of traversing a corner is often referred to as slicing the pie start as close to the wall as possible without scraping up against the wall make sure that you are at least an arms length away from the corner you don t want your firearm to stick out into the doorway 4 x research source observe the corner and keep in your mind that the pivot point will be the apex of the corner the further you step away from the wall the more open space you ll sight 5 x research source take a small step 90 away from the wall this is the start of a semi circle you will make around the corner keep your elbows in and your front foot parallel to your line of sight so that neither will give you away 6 x research source pause and scan the slice of the pie between each step taken you should scan from the floor at the corner to the ceiling scanning each slice in a vertical motion 7 x research source your form will be a firm two handed grip on the firearm you will be leaning slightly toward the direction you are stepping to allow your head and your eyes to be the furthest object allowing you to see your target before he sees you if you are proficient with both hands use whichever hand that will keep you most concealed your feet should never cross as it is a very unstable position and if something or someone were to hit you or you are forced to shoot mid stride your accuracy and balance will be compromised instead you want to move your lead foot the foot in the direction which you are stepping then follow with your trailing foot also be aware of your feet make sure you are not pointing your toes into the corner as they may precede your eyes which means the suspect may be able to see you before you see him practice by setting up a mirror in the room as you are slicing the pie check to see what you can see in the mirror try to adjust your form so that little more than your eye and your firearm are visible you can also practice with another person using flashlights as soon as one of you sees any part of the other shine your flashlight on them the competitive nature of this drill will sharpen your form quickly always point your firearm where your eyes are looking this will allow you to react more quickly than if you have your firearm at low ready arms extended or high compressed ready are both good options a high compressed ready position is achieved by holding the firearm with both hands close to the chest and elbows slightly elevated with high compressed ready make sure that your non firing hand is behind the plane of the muzzle 8 x research source know the dangers of doorways the fatal funnel as it is graciously known is one of the most dangerous areas to be in when traversing a building this area includes doorways and other portals which only allow a narrow area in and out of a room such as narrow hallways and archways if you were picking a choke point for an ambush fatal funnels would be perfect places to focus your attention it is in your best interest to spend as little time as possible in these areas at a doorway the fatal funnel is the area on either side of the door as deep as the door is tall and just as wide 9 x research source so standing to the side of a door does not count obviously the fatal funnel is an imaginary area an area which the intruder might not be respecting so just because you are out of the fatal funnel doesn t mean you can t get shot approach a closed door on the side the handle is on if you are unable to do so for architectural reasons you will have to place your body in the fatal funnel while you open it 10 x research source touch the handle of the door and soft check the handle to see if the door is locked or not if this is your house and you know this specific door does not have a lock you don t have to perform this step 11 x research source bring your gun to close contact firing position as you reach for the door handle when grasping the doorknob use your non firing hand and reach below your weapon this will allow you to bring your weapon to bear without blocking it turn the handle quickly and swing the door open if you are pushing the door away from you be sure to swing the door enough so to expose the whole room if the door stops unusually short of the wall it may be because something or someone is behind the door 12 x research source if you pull the door toward yourself the amount of throw is less important as even a small opening will allow you a peek in the room right away and as you clear the room you can open the door the rest of the way step back from the doorway immediately this keeps you and your gun away from someone who may be on the other side of the door ready to grab you or your gun distance favors the trained shooter in the event that you are the only one with a gun distance favors the person with a ranged weapon 13 x research source scan the room the same way you would go around a corner this time you have to scan up to 180 degrees instead of only 90 clear it with the slicing the pie technique be sure to start at the wall the door frame is attached to clear as much of the room as possible you should know all of the hiding places in your house and pay particular attention to them as you re clearing the room when crossing the fatal funnel during the pie slicing you may want to speed up your pace to spend as little time in the fatal funnel as possible without missing important parts of the room move into the room once you have viewed as much of the room as possible start outside of the fatal funnel and move in toward the caddy corner area this is a diagonal motion and it should be done quickly being sure you don t get hung up on the doorway look over your shoulder as you enter to view the corner you are not heading toward if someone were hiding in the corner that you weren t able to see during the slicing the pie you will be able to see them now the corner you are walking toward is your first priority view that corner before you look at the one behind you as an assailant in the corner in front of you is a higher priority clear the rest of the room for any immediate danger this may include looking behind furniture and in closets you do not want to leave an area unsearched as soon as you leave the room you assume no one is behind you when in fact someone may be approach the door on the doorknob side as before self closing doors include spring loaded or hydraulic closing doors common in most residential houses for the garage access door this presents a set of problems when being approached from the non hinge side if the door opens toward you you are on the hinge side of the door open the door and either use your shoulder or your foot to push it more open as you clear the room 14 x research source if you are on the non hinge side push open the door open as wide as you can depending on the speed at which the door closes you may have time to move to the opposite side of the doorway before you enter this is probably your best option 15 x research source if you can move to the opposite side before you enter this gives you a brief moment to very quickly scan the room for any obvious potential targets if you are unable to step to the opposite side of the doorway you must zig zag into the room enter toward the doorknob side just as the other doorways and openings while the door is still mostly open entering will take some quick thought and adaptation you must be quick on your feet the door may automatically close or close faster than you re prepared for 16 x research source you must quickly commit to entering this is the only way to retain any element of surprise you may have the fatal funnel becomes many times more deadly if you allow the door to close before you go through it now an intruder on the other side of the door knows you must approach that door again to open it use movement to your advantage during high stress encounters you and your adversary will likely have tunnel vision simply zig zagging as you enter the room may cause you to completely disappear for a second or two view the corner you are walking towards during the small window of time the door is closing the door will cover the corner to your back temporarily if you see this corner is clear before the door has almost finished closing you may have time for a quick scan of the room but your priority is the corner behind the door turn and view the corner behind you before the door closes clear the rest of the room as you would any other room also be aware that many self closing doors will slam loudly when they shut be patient and maybe spend a minute or more waiting in that room to see if someone comes looking for you understand that hallways present some of the more difficult dangerous and dynamic areas of a building a partner or two in hallways with doors and t intersections would be very appreciated as at some point you will be forced to turn your back on an area you have not yet cleared you however as a private citizen will likely have to clear it alone therefore you must keep your eyes and ears open and balance multiple danger problems to keep your risk at a minimum don t be fooled though this process and the other processes in this article all pose very high risk walk on one side of a hallway or the other never make your way down the middle of a hallway at the same time keep from touching the walls hallways are similar to doorways meaning that they are a narrow passage that an intruder may be expecting you to come through the middle of the hallway is your fatal funnel 17 x research source handle obstacles such as doorways the same as mentioned above be aware however that stopping in a hallway to clear a room means that you have not cleared the rest of the hallway and an unexplored uncleared area is now at your back 18 x research source corners are no different but what happens if there are two corners in two directions this is a t intersection see the next section for more detailed information on how to clear a t intersection keep track of what areas you have cleared and which ones you have not the areas you have not cleared still contain danger points and you should be splitting some of your attention toward the uncleared areas methodically clear hallways don t walk past one room to clear another doing this means that you now have a room at your back that is uncleared a hallway in front of you which is uncleared and the room you are intending you enter is also uncleared this presents an overwhelming amount of danger zones placing yourself in this situation is unjustifiably dangerous 19 x research source know what makes t intersections especially dangerous t intersections are where two hallways intersect and there are two separate corners to clear neither of which grants better cover than the other you essentially have double the space to clear and several blind spots further down either side of the uncleared hallway start on the right side of the hallway when approaching a t intersections the reasons behind this will be explained in detail later the number one rule here is to not break the plane created by the intersecting hallway still you want to see as much as you can before you commit to entering the hallway keep an eye on the right corner as you make your way toward it make sure nothing is an immediate danger clear the left corner as you would any corner but do not place any part of your body past where the wall ends again crossing the plane created by the intersecting hallway telegraphs your presence to a possible intruder step back and to the left once you ve gotten a view of the left corner clear the right corner the same way you did the left corner decide to enter now that you have cleared as much as you can without crossing the line you must break through the plane enter to the right the reason the order of the side is important is because you can turn faster toward your support side than your firing side if someone ends up being in the corner to your left you can more quickly spin to your left than your right this is all assuming you are right handed everything should be flipped if you are left handed proceed in a fashion similar to a door go through diagonally spotting the corner you are heading toward and a look over your shoulder to the other corner view the images to the right for visual representations approach the stairs as if it were a hallway there will probably be a corner clearing before you get to the stairs clear as much of the stair as you can without getting onto them stairs create a problem when clearing a building alone but seeing as a good portion of residential buildings contain stairs they may need to be traversed at some point 20 x research source the problem with stairs is that in the best situation they have the same properties as a hallway in the worst situation they are a hallway with a t intersection and they may have a landing or two with corners and possibly an overlook onto the stairs all of this means that there are many danger points simultaneously only one of which can be covered at any one time stairs are dynamic and some adaptation may be required to match the stair you may be on stay on one side of the stairs just as in a hallway if there is a corner or other type of twist in the stairs you want to be on the opposite side as the corner 21 x research source look above you before you take too many steps going up stairs see if there is an overlook onto the stairs if there is you will want to clear that as you walk up the stairs 22 x research source keep in mind any corners that are ahead also do not neglect these as said before there are multiple directions that will need your attention a partner could easily cover the overlook while you clear the corner watch any exposed areas that may present themselves many stairs with switchbacks expose your legs before you can see around the corner move your body to allow yourself the best possible view of areas you are unable to see 23 x research source some stairs in apartments or other buildings don t have covered rises in the stairs this is a great way for someone hiding under the stairs to get cover and attack you while you are unable to do anything back the best thing you can do is practice this with a friend using a flashlight if you spot your target you have a couple options in many states you are in your full right to shoot the person but this for most people is a bit drastic you should decide ahead of time even before you own a firearm for personal defense what your personal morals will allow you to do in this and other situations read some information on tactical mindsets if you need help deciding identify yourself you need to give fair warning before shooting if you have identified the intruder and they have already tried to harm you you may not need to provide additional warning keep in mind there may be more than one adversary in the house additionally being shot is not synonymous with dying so keep yourself behind cover as much as possible do not jump to conclusions chances are you are unsure of who your adversary is or do not know his intentions realize an intruder may mask their intentions and someone who broke into your house is probably not there to borrow sugar present yourself by surprise if possible and order the target with short firm phrases once you have gotten your targets attention with stop hands in the air try directing the intruder by saying face away from me and get on your knees having him face away from you and keeping him on his knees prevents him from retaliating against you and keeps him from moving anywhere quickly without a good deal of movement if he has a firearm in his hand be sure to tell him to drop it if he does not comply immediately he is only contemplating the best way to shoot you with it re emphasize the point with else i will shoot you then take appropriate action if he decides to slowly set it down tell him to stop and drop it there have been many police shootings which involved a person slowly setting down a gun then changing their mind and shooting the police instead it will take at least 1 8th of a second from the time they start to bring up their firearm until your brain can react this is plenty of time for them to fire before you know what is going on if the person decides to disregard your commands or makes a sudden move act decisively do the right thing and eliminate the threat hesitating will not save your life you ll only have the luxury of defending your actions if you re physically there to testify a breach of your property rights must be met with swift action you may want to consider also carrying either pepper spray or a taser for these situations it will be much easier to defend your decision to spray or taser an intruder who is simply belligerent than it would be to defend shooting a belligerent intruder wait for the police to come since you have already called the police or have a cell phone on you the police should not be too far behind if for some reason you do not have a cell phone on you you did not already call the police and a phone is not within visual range of the intruder you can have him move while on his knees be sure he doesn t turn to face you keep a close eye on the intruder on the ground but be observant place yourself in a location of cover and be sure he doesn t have any buddies that may come around a corner you have announced your presence to the whole house so another adversary in the house will know exactly where you are but you can t risk leaving the man you have left alone or out of sight allow multiple adversaries to enter a fatal funnel of sorts again this includes any small area where a miss on one man may be a hit on the other multiple targets add a great deal of complexity to a situation but the truth is that most criminals do not work alone telling multiple adversaries to stop is a bad idea by the time you are able to engage one for not complying the other could have attacked you try to decide ahead of time in your mind what you will do if you encounter multiple adversaries remove light from the equation if possible for an advantage most situations which would have you creeping around your own house will likely happen at night it is recommended that you keep the area as dark as possible as you clear your house darkness gives you a few advantages you surely know your house better than an intruder and if you have a flashlight with you you have the ability to completely remove the intruder s night vision 24 x research source keep a hand held flashlight next to your weapon of choice there is also the option to have an additional attached flashlight most tactical or combat weapons have the ability to attach certain lights to the frame of the firearm 25 x research source hand held light gives you options that the attached light does not so while an attached light is a great feature to have on a weapon it cannot always replace the hand held light consider outfitting your firearm with various sights night sights are a welcome feature because they allow you to line up your sights when there is no light this isn t a panacea however if you can t see your sights you may not be able to see your target and you will have an even more difficult time identifying your target make sure you re not dealing with your next door neighbor s son 26 x research source laser sights are also options laser sights will allow you to see where your firearm is pointed without having to use the sights to aim this can be very helpful if you don t have your corrective lenses in as always you must identify your target as hostile before firing which means that you will want to have a flashlight even if you are using a laser allow your eyes to adjust your best accessory is your own body if something happens while you are sleeping your eyes are already adjusted but if something happens and you are around light but you must go into a dark area be sure you let your eyes adjust before you proceed it can take up to 30 minutes for your eyes to fully adjust be aware of your surroundings you do not want to be silhouetted against the light behind you or highlighted by light on you try to approach danger areas from the shadows or from behind other areas of concealment or cover identify a possible target and temporarily blind him by flashing your light at their eyes in order to disorient them aim the light right at the head and turn it on for only a moment a flashlight with a temporary on switch is preferable you need a flashlight with at least 50 lumens to temporarily disorient an attacker at night get a good look at the intruder and with a bright enough light the light splash should allow you to see if he is holding a weapon this action will also get a reaction which will give you an idea into the intruder s head they now know you know where they are and being blinded is not a comfortable situation the chemicals in his eyes which allow humans to see in almost complete darkness will have been burnt away and will take up to 30 minutes to fully return which gives you a big advantage engage the target as described above,Home-and-Garden
how to build a low cost home gym,between costly gym memberships and expensive equipment it seems more and more that exercise is becoming some sort of privilege there is also the pressure to make any

organize them by exercise type endurance strength balance etc so you know what kind of equipment you should be getting for example if your goal is to work on your endurance it may make sense for you to get a treadmill but if you re only interested in building muscle a treadmill probably isn t a good thing to spend your limited resources on count the outlets in your workout space if you want to buy workout machines for your home gym you ll need somewhere to plug them in if your workout space only has one outlet it may be a hassle if you have 3 different machines keep that in mind when you re doing your shopping skip out on workout machines if you want to save more money workout machines can be expensive and it s possible to do most workouts at home using weights resistance bands and an exercise ball you can also install a pull up bar so you can workout your back muscles without large equipment if you feel like you need a workout machine try to find one that s versatile so you get the most bang for your buck seek out equipment less exercise particularly for cardio and general fitness a lot can be accomplished with little financial investment the web is full of useful guides to

go well into the thousands stationary bikes are also adjustable so you won t have to worry as you would with an elliptical about finding one that fits your body keep an eye out for gyms going out of business usually they ll offload their equipment to the public and there s usually no cheaper way of buying quality equipment get a high quality adjustable bench if you can only go big on one item have this be it an adjustable bench will replace the need for an incline bench a flat bench and a decline bench one adjustable bench will save you hundreds of dollars compared to buying all three single benches an adjustable bench is highly versatile and can be used in almost any exercise 4 x research source if an adjustable bench is out of your price range use an exercise ball instead pick up a set or two of dumbbells dumbbells have long been hailed as the better choice among strength training equipment they are much smaller than large home gym machines and much cheaper if you could only buy one thing to go towards strength training this should be it dumbbells free weights will always form the foundation of any budget home gym 5 x research source if you are already quite strong you should get the standard olympic dumbbells which weigh about 12lb unloaded and can be loaded with up to 200lbs each if you don t have the space to keep dumbbells consider using resistance bands instead

more than 15 to 20 make sure you have a sturdy door frame in your home on which to use it try to buy one that doubles as a bar to do tricep lifts and push ups having one of these bars makes it much easier on your wrists when doing push ups invest in an olympic bar with bumper plates if you can afford it this big purchase will bring your strength training up a level bumper plates are more durable compared to ordinary plates as they re rubber coated and allow to be dropped on the floor barbells allow mini increments in weight used from 100gms 1kg this is highly useful for the higher level

how to survive a riot,though it may seem dramatic an angry mob can be just as dangerous and unpredictable as just about any natural disaster thousands of people are killed in riots all over the world each year and these riots erupt from a number of racial religious economic political or social causes that cannot be predetermined if you ve found yourself in the middle of a riot you may not be able to run away immediately but you can take some measures to protect yourself from harm if you want to know how to survive a riot just follow these steps,prepare an escape route if you know you re in a riot prone area but have no way to avoid being there then taking a few simple precautions can have a big impact on your life though it s easier to assume that a riot won t happen in your area it s better to be prepared for the worst even the calmest crowd can turn dangerous when its members are in a frantic angry mood anger and hysteria are contagious so it s best to know how to avoid these situations if they arise get familiar with your area if you re just visiting a location for a season or two you should still get to know your surroundings as intimately as possible study a map until you re very comfortable with the area where you work the area where you live and the routes between those think about your possible escape routes and safe havens before anything actually happens crossroads are good because you ve got at least one road to race off down if rioters go crazy or the police start charging if you work in a volatile environment make sure you know several routes for getting home so that you have a number of methods of escape in the event of a riot carry small amounts of cash with you in case you need to quickly arrange transportation pay off looters or address your basic needs remain calm riots bring intense emotions boiling to the surface but you ll be better off if you can keep your own emotions in check your adrenaline and survival instincts will kick in but strive to think rationally and pursue safety methodically avoid confrontation by keeping your head down walk at all times if you run or move too quickly you might attract unwanted attention keep your loved ones close if you re not alone then the first thing you should do is grip the hands or lock elbows with all of the people who are with you if you re with a child hold them in your arms so they don t get trampled sticking together with your loved ones should be your first priority and your second should be finding a way out reassure the people you re with that you have strength in numbers and that you ll be fine if you stick together don t get involved if you re caught in a riot the last thing you want to do is try to take sides help out or stand out in fact you should stand out as little as possible as you move to the outside of the mob and away from the action to do this stay close to the walls and other barriers and avoid bottlenecks or any areas where a lot of people are squeezing through a small space drive carefully if you re in a car unless your car is the focus of the angry mob in the riot you should stay in the car and continue driving as calmly as possible try to keep to the streets that are clear of riots and avoid the main roads that are more likely to be occupied keep moving forward and don t stop to assess the situation if someone tries to block your car honk your car and keep driving until they get out of the way of course this doesn t mean you should hit the person drive at moderate speed so they have time to back off and realize that you mean business remember that you re in a position of power when you re driving don t let a few angry people stop you from driving your car and keep going unless you absolutely can t many activists are afraid of cars because there have been cases of drivers running down the protesters on the roads remember to be firm but not aggressive to avoid giving the wrong impression move away from the riot as calmly as possible if you re on foot you should move away by going with the flow of foot traffic not against it if you go against the traffic you re much more likely to stand out to get stampeded or just to get pushed or blocked if you feel that you may fall down in the big crowd and get trampled use your elbows to push down on the crowd so that it carries you though you may want to run for your life you should move calmly and relatively slowly continue to move with the crowd until you can escape into a doorway an alley a side street or a safe building if you re in the middle of a crowd it s especially important to try to move in the direction of the crowd until you make your way to the outside of the crowd avoid heavy traffic areas to maximize your chances of safety you should avoid the areas that are most likely to be crowded and should stay off the beaten path so you don t put yourself in a dangerous situation even if the heavy traffic areas are your quickest path home they won t be the safest path if they are the targets of any rioters here s what you should do avoid major roads major roads squares and other high traffic areas are likely to be crowded with rioters if possible stick to less traveled side streets to avoid the mobs avoid public transportation buses subways and trains will likely be out of service and stations and depots will probably be packed with people move to a safe enclosed area riots most commonly happen outside on the streets not inside buildings just by moving inside a sturdy and controlled building you can protect yourself from the brunt of a riot any building with a basement or even a sub basement can help you hide from a mob being in any building at all is safer than being out on the streets look for homes that can serve as safe houses in advance if you re really concerned about finding a safe space in the event of a riot if you can talk to the owners first lock the doors and windows and stay away from them though you may be tempted to watch the riot from the windows this will increase your chances of getting hurt move to rooms that do not lead directly outside to avoid getting hit by stones bullets or other projectiles look for at least 2 exits in the building in case you need to leave in a rush just look out for fire if an angry mob turns toward the building it can be a target stay informed use the local news radio and social media to alert you as to where to stay away from just as the rioters have started using social media and texting to alert one another where to go you can flip this on its head and ask people to help you know where to stay away from messages informing you of which streets and areas are currently being targeted provide you with instantaneous warnings of where to avoid social media may provide new information as rapidly as possible though it may not be as accurate so keep your bases covered remember that staying informed can help you avoid a riot even better than it can help you survive it staying on top of the news can help you know which areas should be avoided in advance wear clothes that minimize your amount of exposed skin it s best to wear long pants and a long sleeved shirt when you go out do not wear clothing that could be interpreted as military or police wear avoid wearing anything that looks like a uniform in addition do not make signs that can be also interpreted as a military gesture furthermore if you do not want to be mistaken for a rioter by the police avoid dark colored clothing especially black hooded sweaters since this type of clothing is associated with rioters in many countries around the world every crowd of rioters is unique though you can t do a costume change in the middle of a riot you should try to avoid looking like the rioters if you can for example if you re caught in a riot and are wearing the same sweatshirt as the rioters take it off carry a solution for rinsing your eyes in case you re exposed to tear gas if you re worried that you may be exposed to tear gas you should have a solution of half liquid antacid and half water you can find these products at many drug stores and grocery store and a spray solution is generally best if necessary use it to rinse your eyes if you are exposed to tear gas you can also carry toothpaste with you and smear it under your eyes if tear gas is released and you have nothing else available to protect you do your best to avoid being hit by riot control chemicals or weapons police may deploy riot control agents tear gas water cannons or rubber bullets for example to disperse a crowd these weapons and chemicals can cause severe pain respiratory distress and blindness try to stay away from the front lines of a riot and learn to recognize the signs that a riot control agent has been used and how to handle exposure avoid wearing oil based moisturizer or sunscreen as chemicals cling to these on your skin remove them with detergent free soap before going near the riot 1 x research source

garden if you have limited space you can even plant a garden using nothing but containers if you are thinking about starting a garden and you are not sure where to begin then there are several things that might help consider different garden types prepare your garden plot and tools select your seeds and plants and then plant your garden,decide what you want to grow or do with your garden there are many different types of gardens and uses for a garden so think about what your ideal type of garden would provide some of the different types of gardens include 1 x research source vegetable garden this may be the most popular and practical type of garden by growing your own vegetables you can save money and increase the number of fresh vegetables you eat flower garden a flower garden adds beauty to your yard and it can be a relaxing escape for you if you are mainly interested in beautifying your property then a flower garden may be the best choice you can plant perennials annuals or a mixed garden butterfly or hummingbird garden you cannot grow butterflies or hummingbirds but you can plant flowers that will attract them to your yard like pollen rich wildflowers dill fennel and milkweed 2 x research source a butterfly or hummingbird garden can be a great type of garden to plan with kids wildlife garden a wildlife garden is one that helps to support the animals in your area by providing them with sources of food and shelter these are typically plants that are native to your area so you would need to learn what your native species are to plan your garden 3 x research source consider how much space you have available if you have lots of space then you can plant a garden in the ground if you have limited space or simply do not want to plant in the ground then you can also plant a garden in containers you can grow a variety of different plants in pots and keep them on a patio or in a sunny spot of your yard some plants even thrive in containers indoors so using containers may also be ideal if you live in an apartment 4 x research source if you live in an area with good soil that is not too rocky or sandy then growing your garden in ground is a good option if growing your garden in ground is not a viable choice then consider buying containers to grow your plants in or building above ground beds above ground beds are great because they are easier on your back and can be moved around your yard if desired make sure the containers or beds are large enough for the plants you want to grow and that they have good drainage if you are limited on space but still want to have your garden outside then you can grow a vertical garden these types of gardens use small planters or stacked crates and upright growing plants determine how much sun your plants will get many plants require around 6 to 8 hours of full sun to thrive if you do not have an area that will provide this much sun then you can still plant a garden you will just have to choose plants that thrive in the shade or with less sun 5 x research source try checking the area where you plan to grow your garden a few times per day on a sunny day to see how long the sun is shining in that area for example you could check at 7am 11am 2pm and 5pm and make a note if the sun is shining on that area around that time if the sun is shining on an area during two or three of your checks then sun loving plants will probably thrive there choose a plot location is important when you are planning your garden most importantly determine if the area you want to use gets enough sun then consider if the size is appropriate for what you want to do with it and also consider how you will water this garden you should either be able to pull a hose over to it if it is a large garden or be able to carry a full watering can to it if it is smaller if you are going to be growing a container garden it is still important to identify a suitable area to place the containers the area should have good sunlight enough room for the plants to grow upwards and they should be easy to transport to a source of water or located somewhere that is convenient to bring water to them test the soil good soil will have an adequate amount of lime phosphorus nitrogen and potassium find out how much of each you have in your soil and what you need to add more of to get the best growing plants if you are planting a container garden then you don t need to worry about this you can just use potting soil that is appropriate for the type of plants you will be growing you can purchase an at home soil testing kit from many hardware and garden stores follow the directions to find out the properties of your garden soil you can take soil samples from around your garden and have them sent to your local state certified soil testing lab or university extension service and for a small fee they will lab test your soil and send you the results within a week this is much easier than testing the soil yourself but it does cost more take multiple soil samples from around your garden to make sure that you are getting accurate test results test your soil s ph to see if you need to make changes to balance it to do this use a ph testing kit or make your own test at home and check the soil from your garden certain plants prefer different ph levels but it is best to have soil that is as close to neutral a ph of 7 as possible 6 x research source prepare your soil once you have your soil and ph tests completed ready your soil by adding the necessary nutrients to help your plants grow add organic matter to help enrich your soil with nutrients you can use compost from your own compost pile if you have one decomposing leaves peat moss or decomposed animal manure all of these are available for purchase at local gardening centers if you don t have easy access to them add fertilizer to your soil to help substitute in nitrogen phosphorous or potassium that you may be lacking the label on the fertilizer bag will tell you exactly how much of each of these nutrients is present the numbers 5 10 5 for example tells you that the fertilizer contains 5 nitrogen 10 phosphorous and 5 potassium following the results of your ph test if your soil is alkaline above 7 try adding lime or wood ash to neutralize it if your soil is acidic below 7 add peat moss or decomposing leaves 7 x research source depending on what plants you want to grow you may not need to alter the ph it is easier to grow plants that will survive in the existing soil research your area it is important to find out information about growing conditions in your area look online speak to a local garden consultant or call your cooperative extension service find out when frosts start and end on average so you know the right time to plant planting too early or too late can kill your seeds or plants so it is vital to know when the best time to start is learn about local weather patterns that might impact your garden look up the best time to harvest your fruits berries and vegetables in your area some of these may be straightforward but some plants require a little more know how about when the best time to harvest them is make a schedule of when each of your specific plants needs to be planted based on their habitat requirement and growing needs some plants may need to be started very early in the season while others may not need planting until the summer 8 x research source gather your tools to make gardening as easy and relaxing as possible it is important that you have all the right tools use a shovel gloves gardening trowel a garden fork baskets or buckets to hold weeds and a watering can at least you can purchase other tools but it is not necessary for a small to medium sized garden for a large garden you may also need to purchase a wheelbarrow rakes and hoes loppers and a post hole digger look into installing an automatic sprinkler system if you don t have time or the ability to hand water your garden 9 x research source determine if you want to start your garden from seeds many plants do well when you start them from seeds check your local garden center for seed packets and look at the label to see how long they take to grow when is the best time to plant them and how much water they need growing from seed can take anywhere from one to four months depending on what you are growing so it is important to plan ahead growing from seeds is the cheapest option as a pack of seeds costs only a few dollars or cents full grown plants purchased from a gardening store can cost anywhere from 1 to 50 each growing from seed has the advantage of allowing you to start the seed in a container and keep it indoors or put it right into the ground however planting a seed in a container and starting it indoors may result in a healthier plant than starting outdoors in the ground 10 x research source it may also provide your plant with an earlier start since you will not have to wait for the last frost consider transplanting mature plants the benefit of transplanting a mature plant into your soil or container is that it is already partially grown and will bear fruit sooner the plant will also be more likely to survive and thrive transplanting mature plants takes only a few minutes of work once the rest of your garden has been prepped check your local garden store for mature plants and make sure to check the tags on the plants to determine if they will work for the type of garden you are planning check out flower bulbs if you choose to grow flowers you also have the option of planting bulbs bulbs are easy to plant and some of them the perennials will come back every year some bulbs are annuals and will need to be replanted every year keep in mind that bulbs only bloom for a few weeks at a time check your local garden store for bulbs that you can plant in your garden and enjoy year after year such as tulips daffodils and alliums arrange your plants choose where you want each plant to go in your garden keep in mind the amount of sunlight they need and the overall size they will grow starting with small plants can be misleading as some may get very large and eventually need bigger plots or containers typically it is safe to give about 10 inches 25 4 cm of spacing between each plant but make sure to read the seed package or tag on the plants to see how much room they will need you will also want to leave enough space between rows so that you will be able to walk between them plan to leave about 18 inches 45 7 cm between rows 11 x research source try to keep your plants in groups by variety for example you can plant all of your vegetables in the same section of your garden and keep your flowers or berries in another section find out which plants will grow the tallest as they will create shade over time and should only be planted near other plants that will also grow tall or near plants that require less sunlight and more shade plant your seeds or plants using the arrangement you have devised place each plant in the garden dig a hole twice the size and the same depth as the root ball or as indicated on your seed packet the depth will vary anywhere from 1 4 inch 0 6 cm to 2 inches 5 1 cm for seed depth depending on what you are planting 12 x research source it does not matter if you are planting in a container or in the ground use the depth guidelines provided on the seed packet don t dig a hole that is too deep only dig far enough to allow room for all of the roots without covering up the stem or leaves the soil in the ground should be level with the soil of the plant you are planting gently set each plant into its hole so as to not damage any part of it use your fingers or a trowel to slowly scoop dirt back into the hole over the roots if the plant you are planting is root bound meaning the roots are wrapping around the container gently massage and loosen them before planting this will help the plant roots spread out into the surrounding soil instead of continuing to wrap around the root ball choking itself out add mulch getting as many nutrients into the soil as you are able will help your plants to grow full and healthy mulch will help with this and it will also help to prevent weeds from growing 13 x research source spread mulch between each of the plants in a layer about one inch thick for vegetables add straw or decomposed leaves as mulch around your plants for the best results flowers do well with wood chips or bark as mulch 14 x research source water your plants the first few weeks after planting should have a bit more water to help the roots to get settled avoid over watering though by flooding the top layer of your garden you only need to provide about one inch of water per week so you may not need to water your garden at all if it rains 15 x research source use a watering can or a spray attachment to your hose to water the plants water them from high up so that you don t damage any of their leaves or stalks after a few days of watering 1 2 times daily you can water less often move to watering once every two days or so 16 x research source keep an eye on your garden and weed it regularly once your garden is settled give it time to grow a healthy garden will last several seasons if it is properly taken care of make sure to check your garden for weeds on a regular basis and pull out any weeds you spot consider putting up a fence if you are growing a vegetable garden then you may want to put up a fence around it to protect it from wildlife this is not absolutely necessary but it can help if you find that you have frequent invaders keep in mind that deer can jump very high your fence will need to be at least 8 feet 2 4 m high to prevent them from jumping into your garden 17 x research source harvest your garden when your garden has grown to maturity harvest the fruits of your labor carefully pick or cut vegetables berries herbs and flowers for use in your own home or simply enjoy walking and relaxing in your garden if you have created it to beautify your property,Home-and-Garden
how to live in the woods,living in the woods surrounded by nature is a fantasy of many city dwellers running the rat race day after day dealing with traffic crime and pollution it s easy to romantically imagine a life more serene through proper planning and sacrifice living in the woods can be an attainable dream and soon an attainable reality,decide where and how you want to live how deep into the woods do you want to live think both geographically and philosophically if you don t mind a short drive outside of the urban sprawl you can live surrounded by woods and still have some of the conveniences of the city you can usually have electricity run to your home and get hooked up to a rural water main a brief commute and you can be at work making the kind of money that would be hard for some to walk away from or were you thinking of something a little more intense this lifestyle still ties one down to the system however it offers most people enough of a reprieve to be happy others can t find happiness just on the other side of the suburbs they desire to be further removed from the rat race and live deeper in the woods as far as north america goes great places to get your thoreau on are british columbia the pacific northwest of the states and vast expanses like montana just make sure you re near water where you choose all depends on what you have in mind and what kind of weather you re willing to well weather if you want to live deeper in the woods plan out your utilities so many of us take for granted modern conveniences we turn on our faucet and out comes water want light flip a switch want heat just turn up the thermostat we forget how easy we have it although paying for them monthly can be challenging having a well drilled and installing solar panels and wind turbines require a substantial initial investment that most people simply can t afford heating with wood is an option but cutting wood is back breaking time consuming work that would probably have most wishing for the days they paid for their heat so plan out your utilities it will help you decide where and how you want to live do you want to live in a cabin in the mountains or do you want to pitch your own tent and live by the light of an oil lamp is the location you have in mind good year around or is it plain freezing in the winter what about rainfall and other possibly dangerous hazards just how much work do you want to be doing know the laws most areas that you may want to live in are already owned privately or publicly if you want to be legal about it you ll need to buy some land however there are seasonal camping passes you can obtain in most states that can also give you a taste of this lifestyle then there s squatting but that can get you in pretty big trouble know the laws of your area and the consequences for your actions before you do anything you may regret 1 x research source consider being in some type of community if you want to truly live deeper in the woods you really need a community not just for your sanity but to make it feasible pooling money is the only way most people can afford the high initial start up costs of living as far from the rat race as possible land purchase construction materials solar panels and having a well drilled are all very expensive even if you plan on living in a sleeping bag and foraging for nuts a community will help you stay sane even if it s just one or two other people 2 x research source want to find some communities that are already doing this three rivers recreation area near bend oregon breitenbush near salem oregon dancing rabbit in missouri twin oaks in virginia earthhaven in north carolina greater world community near taos new mexico and arcosanti ecovillage in arizona are all established off the grid communities don t attempt a move to the woods alone even if you did miraculously survive it would not be the kind of existence anyone could stand for very long we need human interaction to keep from going crazy isolation is the ultimate punishment reserved for our worst prisoners and it almost inevitably drives them to lunacy there are stories of hermit mountain men in alaska who would spend weeks traveling to another s cabin and sometimes just sit not saying anything for a whole day forgetting how to converse but still craving being in the company of another human being unless you want to be a hermit of course don t burn your bridges it s not a good idea when you re on this woods living kick to call up your mom boss and tell them a thing or two about where they can stick it and then tell them you re going to go live in the woods you may need them when a bear s attacked you or all the rice is gone whatever connections you re thinking about leaving behind do it tactfully you may need them later let everyone that you care about that cares about you know of your plan explain your reasons as logically as possible most of them will probably be naysayers most of them probably won t understand and that s fine they don t need to but they do deserve the privilege of knowing and not worrying about you try it temporarily first capitalism has a tendency to stick in the craw of some of us and have us swearing that we d be better off living in the woods sure society has gotten to you the materialism of every inch of this world is heartbreaking but just try it temporarily at first seriously you wouldn t buy a house without looking at it first right you wouldn t get married to a stranger you wouldn t buy a car without test driving it yeah so try it temporarily there s always the possibility that you ll hate it or that a month will be enough 3 x research source remember those seasonal camping passes we mentioned those are perfect for this only instead of de winterizing the rv go out there with your tent your sleeping bag a jar of peanut butter and a fishing net how long can you last how long can your happiness last if you love it come back stock up for the year and go back no harm no foul use the summer and fall to your advantage you know napoleon attacked russia in winter and the russians were all good luck with that buddy don t be napoleon when the weather is nice stock up gather your food whether it s canned goods or nuts you re burying for winter gather your firewood gather your blankets and your snow gear and ready yourself for the harsher months when winter does roll around you can stay in your tent sipping tea from pine needles and reading emerson 4 x research source also use the summer and fall to practice your skills you ll need to get decent at setting traps sharpening knives hunting and gathering preserving meat recognizing plants first aid fire building and fishing fly net and regular just to get you started gather supplies if you re in this for the long haul there will be times when mother nature isn t so nice to you there will probably be heavy rainfall or drought snow wind fires and ice to combat be sure you re prepared for anything and everything here s a quick list of things you ll need to get you started 5 x research source heavy layers boots long underwear gloves hats scarves multiple tents and blankets including a space blanket extremely reflective mylar good for battling the elements and hypothermia matches a fire steel a metal match tinder and flint making fire easier to create in cold and wet times flashlight lantern extra batteries radio whistle first aid kit medicines antiseptic water purifying tablets tools rope knives cord waterproof canisters get real this is no joke living in the woods is a dangerous situation and many haven t made it out alive if you plan on doing it for an extended amount of time what amenities of civilization to you want to hold onto it s not selling out to have a cup to drink out of you know consider the following camping stove dry goods canned or otherwise carbs are a good idea cups silverware plates pots pans radio walkie talkies books and other entertainment read up on the art of forestry if you dropped most people into the woods they d die in a matter of days days might even be generous but if you read up on what you can use to your advantage when it comes to the local flora and fauna birch wood is good for bedding and shelter life will be a lot more interesting and a lot easier and you won t end up munching on those poisonous berries for dinner if you think the corporate world is cruel the woods can be just as terrifying if not more there are plants that will make you bust out in hives there are plants that are only poisonous when raw there are plants with delicious berries but leaves that give you diarrhea and that s not even mentioning the trees soil and animals so get to book learning bushcraft outdoor skills and wilderness survival by mors kochanski is a good place to start there s also how to live in the woods by homer halsted and the entire thing is available online 6 x research source consider arming yourself with the right licensure carrying a gun isn t a terrible idea it could get you out of a sticky situation or two but do know that it could also get you into one too and did you plan on doing any hunting 7 x research source apart from that consider investing in bear spray and other devices to ward off dangerous animals you don t need to tote a gun to defend yourself but you shouldn t rely on your bare hands either you probably don t want to strap broken bottles to your knuckles and fight off wolves in the snow you know learn about the area if you do yourself one favor it ll be learning about your area you want to live near water you want to live where there isn t a lot of danger from nosy park rangers or grizzlies whichever and you want to know what exactly you have at your disposal sure you could figure it out as you go but since you have the liberty of picking where you end up might as well pick the best place be sure to equip yourself with a map and compass you will get lost you will wonder where that one cave was you may even decide you ve had enough and decide to do the 10 mile 16 km trek back to the highway who knows just have them for when you need them you know how to use a compass right have comfortable shelter this part is ultimately up to you do you want to erect a magnificent log cabin or are you more at home in a tent what can you build that would take advantage of the sun the trees not be an eyesore and withstand the elements and where is the best place to make your home base there are dozens of ways to erect a tent before you go about settling for a lean to spend a little bit more time on wikihow there s a plethora of camping articles you ve yet to use to your advantage master the survival techniques you re not just camping for a week spending most of it floating down a river drinking mike s hard you need some serious skills because this is your life 24 7 here s a very non exhaustive list of articles you should get to reading you need to eat stay warm and be hygienic above all else but the entire list is useful how to build a fire how to purify water how to create a tripwire trap how to make a snare trap how to make a day survival kit how to fish how to hunt how to take a bath in a sink bucket or river how to make and use a solar oven stay hygienic when it comes to pooping in the woods we re just gonna put it out there because you know we re all thinking it you basically have two options going about your business wherever and however you like or developing some long term system more than 200 feet from a water source did you know there s such a thing as a composting toilet where you can use waste to fertilize the ground if you re there for a while might as well make the world a better place for it 8 x research source while you can go for the traditional ditch latrine there s also the option of a regular camping toilet heck with all your free time you could develop a brand new system too and then there s bathing hopefully there s a river nearby right aside from having drinking water it s also good so your own stench doesn t drive you batty but if for some terrible reason that s not an option you can make a sweat bath it s kinda like an outdoors sauna it ll probably be a trend for city dwellers in a few years consider living near something urban while you may consider having a reprieve from the wilderness life defeating the purpose it can come in very handy to live ten miles away from a gas station if you re dying just really need a real toilet or would kill the next person you see for a package of beef jerky it can be a true godsend or if you live semi near a town you can go in once every few months for a few staples there s no harm in it your eco footprint is already marginal compared to the rest of us if this is something that intrigues you you may need a form of transportation a bicycle makes the most sense though a motorcycle or moped may also be feasible just know that it s one more thing you must know how to maintain if you do go down this route familiarize yourself with the mechanics of your vehicle you should be its master not the other way around consider upgrading since you plan on being here for a while why not upgrade go off the grid and provide yourself your own sustainable energy and way of living it ll take some money but do think about installing solar panels in your home or utilizing wind energy drilling a well and starting a septic system using a generator starting composting and heck starting farming this is what those communities we mentioned before are doing but you can definitely do it on your own you re already going near green why not reduce your eco footprint entirely by providing yourself everything literally everything you need not like you have a 9 to 5 to blame right someone s gotta make up for the rest of us and imagine how gratifying it would feel to harness your own energy and make all your own food holy cow have a craft you ll probably want something to do with your time right many off the gridders make soaps and lotions make cloth blankets etc from animal hides wood carve make teas and syrups and master other hobbies that utilize nature you could even make a little side money if that interests you whether it s for a profit or just for you having an art is a very good life affirming thing always do what s best for you living in the woods is an enormous feat even doing it for days is nothing to shake a stick at it also can cause a person to get inside their own head and drive themselves crazy you may come to realize that you don t know who you are what this thing called life is all about or what really to do with yourself it might be infinitely more disturbing than you could ever imagine or it could be so freeing you don t know why you didn t do it sooner either way always keep your mental health in mind people will question your sanity you may even question your sanity but if you re happy continue on stay safe warm healthy and strive to live the life you dream of whatever it may be,Home-and-Garden
how to hook up hydraulics,hydraulic systems use liquid under pressure to perform work designing and building a hydraulic system requires some mechanical knowledge and specialized components but the results can allow a machine to do jobs it would be difficult to do otherwise,understand how a hydraulic system works there are basically four elements to the system as well as possibly many smaller associated components for specialized purposes here are the basic four and a brief description of each 1 x research source fluid reservoir this is a tank or other container that holds the fluid to supply the rest of the system fluid circuit these are the pipes or hoses which transfer the fluid from one element of the system to another hydraulic pump this device pushes hydraulic fluid through the circuit and provides the energy for the system to do its job hydraulic motor or cylinder this is the component that causes something to move driven by the power of the hydraulic pump subcomponents that manipulate or regulate the fluid as it does its job include various valves which allow excess fluid to bypass the hydraulic motor or cylinder control valves or valve spools regulators accumulators pressure switches and pressure gauges determine what type of power source your hydraulic system will require this can be an electric motor and internal combustion engine steam wind or water power the main requirement is that the means for supplying the system with energy is that it is available and can generate sufficient torque for the purpose it is intended look at some simple everyday hydraulic systems to help you become familiar with their function a hydraulic jack 2 x research source can allow a small person to lift 20 tons of weight or more a power steering system on a car can reduce the force required to steer it considerably and a hydraulic log splitter can force a steel wedge through even the toughest wood plan your hydraulic system project with the design parameters you will require you will need to decide what type of power you will use for generating pressure for the system to do the work what type of control valves if any what type of pump you will use and what type of tubing you will pipe plumb your system with you will have to choose a power delivery system to accomplish the task you are building your system for an example would be using a hydraulic cylinder to split a log or lift a heavy weight 3 x research source determine the amount of work your system will do to allow you to size the components correctly a large capacity system will need a pump rated at a high volume measured in volume per minute such as gpm or gallons per minute and pressure measure in weight per unit of area such as psi or pounds per square inch this being said and typical hydraulic pump may deliver 0 65 gpm at 2200 psi the same applies to the hydraulic engine or cylinder you will use to drive or operate your machine an example is a cylinder that lifts a set of forks on a forklift it requires x gallons of oil at y pressure to lift ___ pounds ___ feet in the air choose the appropriate container for your hydraulic fluid reservoir a steel or plastic tank that can have leak proof fittings attached to it to connect hoses or pipes will work remember the reservoir is not pressurized when the system is operational but you will need to vent it if you pipe excess fluid directly back to it through a bypass valve or other device 4 x research source pick a suitable material to plumb up your hydraulic circuit reinforced rubber hoses with o ring seals or flared fittings may be the easiest to route on your machine but high tensile steel tubing is more durable and requires less maintenance over time find a suitable valve system for your task a simple on off fluid valve will function as a control valve if it is rated for the operating pressure of your system but for complicated functions you will be better off with a variable flow valve spool which can regulate the flow and in some instances the direction of flow in a hydraulic circuit select the type of and capacity of your hydraulic pump there are essentially two types of hydraulic pumps a generator type which forces oil between two or more meshed gears in a sealed housing or a roller type which operates with a number of cylindrical rollers configured around a cam in a sealed housing they each have advantages and disadvantages so choosing one that performs to your machine s requirements is up to you 5 x research source pair up a suitable motor to your pump pumps may operate off of a direct drive shaft a reduction gear drive a chain and sprocket drive or a belt drive obviously each is more suitable in specific applications and the choice depends on individual design criteria hook up your power application component for simply moving an arm or lever on a machine a hydraulic cylinder is your most likely choice this device is a steel tube with a piston rod assembly inside of it sealed to prevent oil from escaping 6 x research source there are a number of types of cylinders in many different sizes so again selection depends on the specific design requirements of the project another device that uses the hydraulic power supplied by the pump is a hydraulic motor seen used on winches and ground drive wheels on some types of aerial equipment as well as manufacturing equipment like metal forming rollers build a support frame that will position each component in a position where it will perform it s task this can be done on a flat surface a metal framework or even in multiple framed remote function elements an example would be having a pump reservoir and valve assembly on one platform and having the hydraulic cylinder and support assembly in another location as is found on hydraulic elevators in 2 to 4 story or even higher buildings fill the system with the hydraulic fluid you choose bleed the air out of it then pressurize it to check for leaks now it should be ready to operate it to assess the function of the components without specific design criteria and engineering it is likely you will need to tweak the finished product to optimize its operation,Home-and-Garden
how to aerate a yard,a lush and thriving yard requires the right amount of air and water penetration to allow vital nutrients to enter the soil yards comprised of firm compacted earth do not allow oxygen water and nutrients to reach grass roots yard aeration helps to break up the soil to promote unobstructed air flow and water absorption it will also help to break up the thatch layer that may also be preventing water and nutrients from getting into the soil determine if the turf needs a good de thatching because even if you are using a bagger when mowing it will still eventually build up and create an impregnable layer,know what kind of grass you have different types of grasses grow most actively during certain seasons of the year 1 x research source it s best to aerate your lawn just before or during your lawn s most active period of growth so that the grass will grow back quickly and recover from the aeration process warm season grasses like buffalo grass bermuda grass and st augustine grass grow most actively during the summer if you have warm season grass it s best to aerate in the late spring to early summer cool season grasses like kentucky bluegrass fescue and ryegrass have their most active growing season in the fall when the temperature drops aerate cool season grass at the end of the summer or the beginning of fall just make sure you aerate early enough that you allow the lawn to recover from aeration for a month or so before the first frost hits know what type of soil you have clay heavy soils need to be aerated frequently about once a year since the soil tends to be dense and compact sandy soils can be aerated every two years or so know your lawn habits do you drive on your lawn often or frequently have large groups of people walking over it lawns that are trampled often need to be aerated once a year to prevent the soil from getting too compact have you recently reseeded your lawn it s best not to aerate within a year of reseeding since the grass needs time to get strong test your lawn s need for aeration by examining how deep the grass s roots extend into the soil if the roots don t go deeper than two inches you should aerate the soil you can check using a soil probe single core probe a heavy long shanked screwdriver or a small spade decide which type of yard aerator to use there are two types of aerators power and manual choose the one that best fits your needs a power yard aerator is a gasoline driven machine that is best suited for large yards this type of aerator uses a spike system to poke holes in the soil or a coring system that pulls plugs of soil out of the ground to allow for water and nutrient absorption you can rent a power yard aerator from a landscape company by the day for a small fee talk with your neighbors about splitting the cost of the rental and sharing the machine a manual yard aerator works more efficiently on small yards or heavily trafficked areas of a lawn two types of manual yard aerators exist a coring style aerator that uses a cylinder to remove cores of earth and a spike type of aerator that rolls over patches of lawn to insert holes without extracting soil lawn care specialists and enthusiasts promote the core style of yard aerators as these types promote the best water and nutrient absorption prep the yard for aeration yard aerators work best on cleared mowed yards if you have sprinklers then turn them on for a short time first and mark where each on is so that you can avoid them rake debris like leaves sticks and other plant matter from the yard to make sure nothing obstructs the path of the aerator mow the yard before you aerate to ensure the aerator has easy access to the ground if your lawn mower doesn t contain a bag to catch the grass clippings rake them up and discard or compost them when you are finished mowing check the moisture level of your yard if your region has been dry lately water your lawn for a few days before you aerate the yard to soften tough soil manual and power yard aerators perform more efficiently on softened earth however core aerators perform better on dry soil because the corer will not pull the plug out if it is too wet and aeration holes will seal shut know which areas of your yard are the most trafficked plan to go over those areas with your aerator more than once to ensure you sufficiently aerate that section of yard position the yard aerator in one corner of the yard move it from one side of the yard to the other in even rows until the whole area is properly aerated don t cover the entire yard more than once only double over areas that need extra aeration if your yard requires further aeration run the yard aerator in the opposite direction from the first pass you took to maximize aeration leave the cores of earth alone after you aerate these cores will compost over time and benefit your yard with nutrients keep in mind that it might look unsightly for a little while if someone asks about it then you can just make a joke and say you have very healthy earthworms fertilize your yard after you aerate it spread compost sand peat moss or another fertilizer over your yard to help your lawn spring back from aeration the fertilizer will be absorbed easily through the newly made holes,Home-and-Garden
how to live in a yurt,a yurt is a very basic tent like structure traditionally used for nomadic living while anyone can choose to live in a yurt they are especially suitable for those who prefer to live in nature buy or build your yurt according to your own needs and standards and be sure to place your yurt near a clean water source by putting the time and energy towards building a tiny dwelling you ll be able to enjoy the simple sustainable lifestyle that yurts facilitate,build a yurt if you have the time resources and carpentry skills building a yurt requires many of the same processes as building a tiny house the main difference lies in the placement of your yurt secluded in nature rather than near civilization if you re thinking of building a yurt look into different yurt patterns online and watch some yurt building tutorials on youtube to determine whether or not you re up for the challenge 1 x research source buy a yurt if you d rather not build your own if you re overwhelmed by the task of building a yurt from scratch you can buy yurt building kits or pre made used yurts look online for a yurt or yurt kit that will suit your lifestyle some companies including pacific yurts and rainier yurts are renowned for making high quality yurts 2 x research source yurts tend to cost around us 2000 to 6000 to purchase in kit form and take about two days to assemble choose a safe and legal land area before setting up your yurt be sure that the area is legal for setting up camp if you do not own the land where you want to place your yurt you may need planning permission so check with your local municipality for the ins and outs of part or full time yurt living you should also make sure that the regional area is not at risk for flash flooding or excessive snowfall 3 x research source opt for a location below the brow of a hill if possible setting up your yurt at the base of a large hill will help protect your yurt from winds place your yurt near a clean water supply for the sake of cooking and cleaning it s best to have your yurt situated near a clean water source if this isn t possible consider investing in a small rainwater tank or an appropriate system for roof top water collection 4 x research source prepare a base for your yurt most yurts are built over decks cinder block piers or some other solid structure that elevates the floor of your dwelling from the earth if you can afford to buy or build a deck these structures are recommended for their dual function as places to sit barbecue and hang clothes 5 x research source consider building a portable deck that way if you get the nomadic itch your deck can come with you equip your yurt with basic furniture although your yurt is no mansion you ll want to furnish it with several pieces of useful comfortable items to accommodate your daily life consider adding a table and chairs a bed a bookshelf and a comfortable reading chair if you don t want to add a real bed use a camp stretcher foldaway or inflatable bed add a cooking apparatus you ll need to eat and even if much of your food is from the result of foraging you ll also need to cook find a suitable gas or wood fueled stove that can double up as a heating item in the yurt such as a pot bellied stove be sure to vent the stove outside through one wall of the yurt as unvented stove will create dangerous fumes within the yurt you might need a professional to help you install this part of the yurt consider bringing a propane barbecue to keep outside your yurt as an additional tool for cooking create an outhouse you will need a way to use the toilet and while some people opt for outdoor plumbing natural forms of human composting are more common amongst yurt dwellers it s best to place your toilet downwind from the yurt or some distance from it so that the odor and flies don t enter your yurt 6 x research source construct a bath or shower area you can create a simple shower contraption by rigging a tree with a bucket or plastic bag and using solar power to heat the water you can also bath in clean streams or lakes nearby or by heating water and filling a large tub near your yurt 7 x research source it s also a good idea to have a general washing area for dirty gear and items most clothes items can be washed by hand until they re heavily soiled so you can supplement hand washing with monthly trips to a laundromat get connected to the internet if you want there are a number of possible ways to get internet to your yurt including cable satellite rural broadband on an fm signal or 3g wi fi select the option most appropriate for your location 8 x research source connect to a main source of energy you can bring electricity to your yurt by running a line from a main supply to your yurt or by using a generator because this option tends to be expensive and requires the greatest volume of electrical power it is the least advisable option for powering your yurt 9 x research source utilize natural energy sources if you have access to solar or wind energy devices and storage batteries these are great tools to power your yurt although solar wind power devices are often expensive these investments are more environmentally friendly than generators 10 x research source find a source of lumber and build outdoor fires building fires can provide a steady source of energy for heating your yurt and cooking meals if you re using wood as your primary source of heating energy and you re living in a colder environment expect to go through about 3 5 4 cords of wood building fires can also help supplement any of the other energy sources listed above 11 x research source bring an electric light source while the dome at the top of your yurt will allow for plenty of light during the day you ll need a light source for nighttime hours find suitable gas battery or led lamps that are safe to have inside tents and keep some candles nearby for emergencies grow vegetables next to your yurt if you re committed to a sustainable lifestyle a well maintained vegetable garden can provide a complete food supply for you and your other yurt residents you might also consider a keeping a few animals as well for milk eggs and even meat 12 x research source compost all your kitchen and food scraps and use the compost pile to nourish your garden enjoy living in your yurt your yurt will be a cozy haven away from the hustle and bustle of urban lifestyles and you ll soon learn to appreciate the joys of self sufficiency that come from living in nature,Home-and-Garden
how to wire a light,trying to wire a light in your home can be intimidating after all wiring involves electricity and electricity can be dangerous however by taking basic precautions and understanding the basic working of a circuit and the wires involved you can have new fixtures wired and installed in your home in no time,cut power to your circuit the best way to do this is by turning off the electricity supplied to the circuit on which you will be working at the junction box also called a fuse box for your home switch the breaker of your fuse box so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to your fixture reads off 1 x research source it s always a good idea to double check the flow of electricity by checking the light itself before moving forward with this project flick the light on and if the circuit has been disabled the light should stay off clean the old fixture and installation area if the light you are wiring is in the ceiling you should clean any cobwebs and dust before attempting to install your new fixture the same is true for lights or switches in walls a clean work area will improve your ease of installation if you are using a ladder to reach your light fixture or are in a less than ideal position be sure the ground is also clear of debris or anything else that might affect your balance or safety remove the old fixture covering there is usually but not always a decorative globe shield or some kind of external feature covering your existing light fixture this could also be something more involved like ceiling fan blades 2 x research source unmount the fixture there will be a mounting bracket holding your old fixture in place you will need to unscrew this from mounting bracket usually with phillips head screwdriver and then pull it from the bracket be sure you support the old fixture with your hand as you unscrew it from the mount if you do not support the fixture it could fall to the floor once you loosen the screws holding it in lower the fixture allow the unscrewed fixture you are supporting with your hand to descend a few inches below its mount you will likely see three wires attached to your fixture a hot wire grounding wire and neutral wire you will need to use your free hand to uncouple these wires twisting the wiring cap to free the wires from each other hot wires are those that run electricity to your fixtures and grounding wires are intended to offer surge electricity a neutral point like the earth into which it can dissipate 3 x research source in some cases a grounding wire might be attached to the mounting bracket itself rather than a house wire this is fairly common in new light fixtures disengage your light from its wires you should see plastic caps called wiring caps also called a wire nut with two wires running into each cap one wire will come from the light the other from the main electrical circuit of your house disengage the wires by twisting the wiring cap until it comes free 4 x research source once you have released the light from its wiring you can set the existing light fixture aside check for compatibility in most cases the mounting hardware for your new fixture will fit the bracket that s already installed you ll need to hold the new light fixture up to the existing mounting bracket and compare fasteners and size to make sure you don t need to install a new mounting bracket swap in a new bracket if necessary oftentimes if a light requires a special bracket this will be included with the light you have bought if not you can look up the light information online by doing a general search of the name of the light fixture which you can find on the box listed with its information should be mounting information as well once you know the kind of bracket you need you can find and purchase it at your local hardware store replacing the old bracket is just a matter of unscrewing it and screwing the new one into place investigate the age of your wiring this is especially important if you have an older home in particular any home built before 1985 wiring installed prior to 1985 has weaker insulation than contemporary circuits meaning the heat generated by your fixture could cause a short fire or worse fixtures unsafe to use for older wiring will have a warning label that says use wire rated for at least 90 degrees c fixtures without this warning will still be suitable for your pre 1985 wiring 5 x research source join like colored wires depending on your country the colors that code which wires are live ground and neutral may differ in any case you should support your new light with one hand and take each like colored wire coming from your wall or ceiling and combine it with its mate coming from the light fixture twist the exposed ends of the wire together and seal it by screwing on a wiring cap a general guide to electrical wiring color code is as follows 6 x research source ca live black single phase red with a second hot wire neutral

ground green green and yellow or bare copper 7 x research source 8 x research source ground your fixture if there is a remaining wire that is green green and yellow or bare copper you should screw it into place on the mounting hardware for your light fixture there will likely be a small screw for this purpose on the fixture which you can unscrew slightly slot the wire into the gap between screw and fixture and then tighten to fasten your ground 9 x research source be sure your ground wire feeds to a place it can safely disperse an electrical current many metal surfaces can be suitable for this purpose fasten your fixture in the mounting bracket continuing to support your fixture with your hand hold it in place so as to line up the screw holes with those of the bracket and screw it into the mount using the hardware that came with the fixture finish any supplemental installation there may be external features or parts like a light cover or ceiling fan blades to add to your new light fixture take a moment to step back and inspect your fixture for levelness orientation and flushness with the surface on which you ve installed it some light fixtures are permanently angled a certain way and improper installation can lead to your light shining where it does little good test your new light return to your fuse box and reset the fuse for the room in which you ve been wiring to restore the flow of electricity to the room now you can install a light bulb and turn on the new light fixture you have installed to test it out 10 x research source test for electrical current sometimes over the course of installation a wire might be jostled or damaged in such a way as to compromise its ability to transmit electricity to your new light additionally in some cases contractors may have used different colored wires for your electrical setup in both of these cases you should use a circuit tester to ensure you don t make a dangerous mistake with your wiring a circuit tester can be purchased at most hardware stores turn off the electricity free the wire you are uncertain about from the old fixture and then turn the electricity back on being sure that your free wire is not touching anything dangerous your circuit tester will have two nodes connect one to the questionable wire and the other to a grounded metal surface or your ground wire if the light on your tester turns on the wire is hot and is supplied with electricity 11 x research source create space to work some wiring jobs are done haphazardly with poorly managed wire in the fixture box or wall or ceiling where you are working after turning off the circuit hold up your fixture to your mount to approximate how much wire you will need be sure to leave some excess wire can become damaged or get brittle over time in which case you might want to strip some insulation off the wire to tie a new fixture in to your circuit give yourself more wire if you are working with older wire or if the stripped part of the wire is difficult to work with after you have cut power to the circuit you are working on you can strip more wire for greater ease of handling it is recommended that you remove about ½ of wire insulation with a wire stripper or a utility knife be sure you exercise care when using a utility knife you don t want to nick or damage the metal part of your wire 12 x research source give yourself another hand while wiring if you have a friend of family member available to assist it can help a great deal to have this person hold the fixture while you re wiring if you do not have help available you can bend a piece of unused scrap wire to hang the light securely from the mount with the fixture secured you should be able to use both hands making the wiring portion a cinch 13 x research source an assistant is especially helpful when you are wiring a ceiling light while you are on a ladder or chair your helper can hold you steady hand you tools and parts and take unneeded parts from you as you finish,Home-and-Garden
how to become a hobo,historically many people have been forced into becoming hobos because of circumstances where jobs are so scarce that they have no choice but to travel from place to place in search of work there are many theories of the origin of the word hobo ranging from a contraction of the words hoe boys to one from the words homeward bound in any case the american heritage dictionary defines a hobo as one who wanders from place to place without a permanent home or a means of livelihood but the dawn of the internet and increased dissatisfaction with the 9 to 5 routine have led more and more people to wonder if earning a living while on the road is a viable alternative to the daily grind if you re thinking about becoming an opportunistic and resourceful transient worker keeping your costs low your responsibilities simple and your freedom intact here are the questions you ll need to ask yourself and the preparations you ll need to make,remember the differences between hobos tramps and bums hobos are people who travel and look for work tramps are people who travel and don t look for work bums are people who neither travel nor look for work take stock of your skills and experience historically hobos have made their living from manual labor but that doesn t always have to be the case any skill that is in wide demand and does not require an extended time commitment can be useful to a hobo as long as you can advertise your services and earn people s trust ideally through references you can do anything some pursuits that lend themselves to this lifestyle are landscaping and construction many migrant workers who cross international borders find work in this area as it is the least demanding in terms of language barriers having experience is essential

how to pack furniture for moving,moving can be exciting but it can also feel like an overwhelming amount of work packing your furniture is one of the biggest components of any move if you gather the right materials and wrap your pieces carefully you can make sure they survive the move in great shape just make sure to break down larger items before packing if possible you ll also want to take extra care with fragile items by using extra layers of protection,decide which pieces of furniture to take apart moving can be difficult especially if you have a lot of large pieces of furniture if possible you ll want to disassemble items that will not fit through doorways or down a narrow staircase you should also think about taking apart fragile items or highly valuable items as they can be easier to move in pieces a list of items you want to disassemble might include 1 x research source beds armoires or wall cabinets tables desks take pictures of each piece of furniture that you want to disassemble don t forget you ll need to put the pieces of furniture back together again it is a good idea to take pictures of the disassembling process so that you can have a visual reminder of what things are supposed to look like 2 x research source take multiple pictures to record each step of the process you can reference the pictures when you put the piece back together again purchase packing supplies furniture should generally not be placed in a truck without wrapping it in some sort of protective material after you ve completed your inventory consider what you ll need to move each piece of furniture for example items like couches will generally be wrapped in blankets and tape something like a lamp might be wrapped in bubble wrap you can purchase supplies at your local hardware store or online potential supplies include 3 x research source sofa mattress covers or blankets bubble wrap plastic wrap packing sealing tape remove the cushions and take apart the sofa by uncovering the frame start by removing all of the cushions and turning the sofa onto its back unscrew the legs and place those and the cushions aside to move separately use a flathead screwdriver and pliers to remove the staples that secure the covering to the bottom of the sofa 4 x research source roll the upholstery far enough up that you can see the frame of the sofa and the fasteners that hold the arms to the base loosen the bolts or screws that secure the arms with an allen wrench or a screwdriver roll up the upholstery far enough so that you can remove the arms look for the bolts that hold the seat and back of the sofa together remove the bolts and separate the pieces of the frame just as you did with the arms take careful notes so that you remember how to reassemble the sofa only undo as much upholstery as is necessary follow these same steps to take apart an easy chair remove the seat back and wheels to break down a desk chair desk chairs can be broken down easily for a move turn the knob on the bottom of the seat to the left until it is loose enough to remove remove the seat from the bottom of the chair push the lever that lowers the seat lower it as far as it will go to make the base as small as possible for moving 5 x research source if you pull on the wheels they should easily pop off store them in a separate bag for moving all chairs are different if yours is more complex follow the instructions that came with the chair if you no longer have them check the manufacturer s website for detailed instructions for your specific model unscrew table legs to disassemble a table for small tables place them on a surface like a counter or a workbench so that you can see underneath for larger tables you will likely need to get underneath the table for a good vantage point each leg will be held in place with hardware called a leg assembly locate each leg assembly and use a screwdriver to loosen and remove the bolts from each leg assembly once the screws are out remove the braces from the legs you may also need to unscrew the legs from the table gently twist them to the left until they come loose easily pack the braces and screws separately in a clearly labeled bag remove the headboard and footboard to begin taking apart your bed strip your bed of all bedding and pillows remove your mattress and box spring from the frame and place them to the side use a screwdriver to unscrew the headboard and foot board from the mainframe of the bed 6 x research source if your bed frame has slats unscrew each slat and remove them from the frame remove knobs and other removable pieces from dressers and desks if your dresser or desk has knobs remove them by twisting them to the left until they come off you will also want to take off any removable parts on any other items for example if you have a kitchen cart remove the wheels and any handles that stick out 7 x research source if you re moving somewhere locally you can keep non fragile items in your drawers you mat have to stuff the drawer with packing paper so things don t shift around 8 x expert source marty stevens heebner smm c cpo professional move manager expert interview 14 january 2020

the entire circumference of the piece make sure to also cover the top and bottom of the item pretend like you are wrapping a present and make sure to cover everything 10 x research source for larger pieces you will need multiple blankets or pads wrap table and chair legs with blankets or pads it s best if you can remove the legs before packing if they are not removable make sure that they are wrapped very carefully tightly secure the material by going around each individual leg with the padding and the plastic wrap you want to be able to see a distinct outline of each table leg 11 x research source secure covers with plastic wrap 12 x expert source marty stevens heebner smm c cpo professional move manager expert interview 14 january 2020 take hold of the roll of plastic wrap and begin winding it around the piece of furniture for a sofa for example you would start at one arm and go all the way around the sofa with the wrap until you reach your starting point wrap each piece of furniture in plastic wrap to keep the blankets or pads from shifting during the move 13 x research source for long distance moves the plastic wrap will also keep dirt from getting to your furniture place pieces of cardboard on the corners of desks and dressers and on glass tops of tables after the furniture is wrapped add cardboard to the corners of large items to protect pieces such as dressers place several inches of cardboard under the bottom of the furniture bring the rest of the cardboard up so that it covers the base of the item bend the cardboard to cover the corners of the furniture secure with packing tape 14 x research source you can do this for pieces of wood furniture such as a dresser or desk to keep the corners from getting damaged in the move place a piece of strong cardboard over glass tabletops secure with packing tape wrap fragile items with bubble wrap you might want an extra layer of protection for certain items if you are particularly worried about scratches or other damage to a piece of wooden furniture add a layer of bubble wrap on top of the plastic wrap take a roll of bubble wrap and wrap it around the entire piece of furniture securing with tape 15 x research source wrap your mirrors using tape and cardboard use masking tape to create several x shapes on the front of each of your mirrors this will keep the glass from shattering if you accidentally bump or drop the mirror cut small pieces of cardboard to place over the edges of each corner secure the cardboard with tape 16 x research source next cut two pieces of cardboard to cover the front and back of your mirror wrap an old sheet around the mirror then cover with the cardboard pieces and secure with packing tape you can also use bubble wrap to create this protective layer you can also cut two pieces of styrofoam to fit on the front and back of each mirror for an extra layer of protection secure with packing tape if your mirror is small enough to fit in a box place extra padding in the box you can use old sheets or towels or more bubble wrap pack your television by covering it with a cloth and securing with plastic wrap cover your television with an old blanket or cover take two styrofoam blocks and cut a piece the width of your tv screen out of each place the blocks over the blanket or tv cover and secure by wrapping plastic wrap around the screen make sure to tape all cords to the base of the tv so they don t get in the way wrap your lamp in the newspaper remove the light bulb and lampshade from the base of the lamp and set aside wrap the cord around the base of the lamp and secure it with tape wrap the base of the lamp in newsprint and secure it with tape 17 x research source place the lamp in a box and place crumpled newsprint around the sides to pack the lampshade line the sides of a box with newsprint and place the shade in the box place crumpled newsprint under the shade to help it retain its shape wrap bar stools in bubble tape bar stools are generally pretty hard to take apart so your best bet is to make sure they re protected for the move wrap the legs in bubble wrap and secure with packing tape cover fabric seats with plastic wrap to protect them 18 x research source if your stools have removable cushions remove them from the stools and pack them separately pack a baker s rack by covering it with blankets or pads before packing empty your baker s rack move items such as dishes food and cookbooks separately wrap the empty rack in a blanket or pad and secure it with plastic wrap secure any doors with zip ties or rope 19 x

how to make a beach,can t make the trek to the beach not a problem bring it to your own home whether you want to build in your backyard or next to a pond or lake on your property the beach can be moments away winter spring summer or fall,pull weeds and measure the length and width of the beach area get your garden tools and remove all plants from the area you ll be putting in your beach once the area is clear use your tape measure to determine its length and width it may be easiest to use a shovel to remove the top layer of plants or till the greenery under the surface of the soil 1 x research source if you plan on hanging a traditional hammock this is the perfect time to dig some postholes and sink a sturdy wooden 4x4 board 2 x research source purchase sand and gravel gravel will form the base of your beach area and can be shaped to add a dune like contour the amount you ll need will depend on the amount of contour you desire where sand s concerned you ll need enough to cover the entire area at least 6 in 15 2 cm deep beach or mortar sand work best and are widely available decomposed granite can also work as your base and is easy to mold into dunes if you re unsure how much sand you ll need input the length width and depth of your planned beach area into an online sand calculator this number is usually in cubic yards or meters add a plastic liner to deter plant growth if you don t put down a liner over time plants will invade your beach area even if you were really careful when weeding you can pull these up as they push through the sand but a plastic liner will make plant invasions all but nonexistent 3 x research source spread the gravel on the liner if you want a level beach area rake an even layer of gravel onto the plastic liner heap up small hills so that when it s covered with sand it looks like sand dunes when you ve got the contour just right spray it liberally with water and let it sit overnight hosing down the gravel base will harden it making it more stable to prevent too much sand from falling into gaps in the gravel use a little potting soil to fill gaps and holes after the gravel dries 4 x research source finish your backyard beach with a layer of sand spread sand evenly over the entire area though you may want to add some extra to high traffic areas or play areas this will prevent the gravel from being exposed and make your backyard beach more realistic if you haven t plugged holes with potting soil at first it may seem like sand is simply disappearing into the gravel keep layering it on until the sand is at least 6 in 15 2 cm deep keep a rake set off to the side of your beach area so you can redistribute sand when necessary and keep a healthy layer over top the gravel beneath verify you can build your beach some regions may have laws in place to protect the land surrounding bodies of water even those that are manmade like ponds check for restrictions like these with your local zoning board or department of natural resources you might ask about regulations saying something like hi i m planning on adding a manmade beach to a pond on my property are there any laws or regulations i should be aware of moving forward you should inspect the area where you ll build your beach thoroughly accidentally harming endangered plants or animals may still carry a stiff penalty 5 x research source determine your method of weed control if you only layer sand on the shoreline of your body of water plants will eventually spring up and reclaim the area similar to a backyard beach you can use a plastic liner to prevent plant growth beneath your sand 6 x research source as an alternative to the plastic liner you can use regular applications of an herbicide to keep your beach looking sandy and pristine some regions have laws against using a liner or other kinds of plant barriers underneath a fresh layer of top sand 7 x research source purchase large grained sand generally you ll want the largest grain beach or mortar sand you can get outdoors sand is more likely to be blown around your property or washed to the bottom of the body of water large grained sand will be less likely to migrate away from your planned beach area for most outdoor beaches you should plan to cover it in at least 6 in 15 2 cm of sand but do not exceed more than 18 in 45 7 cm 8 x research source there are products you can buy like sand mats that prevent weeds from growing and sand from being washed or blown away remove weeds this may be a time consuming process if your beach area is large a shovel rake and some elbow grease will eventually get the job done but a rototiller backhoe or front loader will make weed removal a cinch rototillers backhoes and front loaders can be very expensive save some money by renting one of these when you need it from your local hardware store or home centers install shade cloth on the bare ground moisture and gasses in the soil and air can cause your sand to be absorbed into surrounding soil especially clay a shade cloth with prevent this from happening purchase shade cloths at hardware stores and home centers 9 x research source create a short wall curb or barrier for your sand unless you have some kind of wall or barrier where your sand transitions to the natural bottom of the body of water your sand will quickly be washed away a concrete curb landscape timber barrier or cross tie boundary all work well for retaining sand be sure you clearly mark the retaining feature with buoys flags or similar things to prevent swimmers from stubbing toes or otherwise harming themselves 10 x research source add the sand and use a sand rake to maintain it now that all the prep work has been done all you need to do spread out the sand after that rake the sand regularly with a sand rake like the kinds used on golf courses to prevent plant seeds from growing if your sand becomes flat and hard use a rototiller hoe or pickaxe to break it up a couple of times every year 11 x research source use surfboards towels and similar items to convey a tropical theme you can also hang hawaiian leis flower necklaces from chairs surfboards bannisters and fence posts to get a tropical feel to recreate a tropical beach setting decorate with bright colors drape colorful beach towels from chairs or lay them out on the sand for sunbathing items made from wood bamboo and linen will add to the beachside vibe try to keep your theme cohesive and consistent grow beach plants by growing plants common to beach areas on your beach it will be even more realistic you may be able to insert some plants right in the sand but others might do best in a pot some plants to consider for your beach arthropodium cirratum rengarenga lily astelia chathamica silver spear austroderia toetoe carex virgata frangipanis yucca faxoniana spanish dagger 12 x research source create a fire pit as the sun sets and the temperature drops many beach parties often turn into beach bonfires collect some rocks or flagstones and arrange these in a circle to create a fire pit depending on where you ve built your beach it may be easier and safer to set out a standalone metal fire pit or brazier 13 x research source in most areas making a fire out in the open requires a burning permit this should be available through your local government offices like the clerk or fire department improve the ambiance of your beach area with lighting natural light should do most of the work for you during the day but direct sunlight can be brutal offer some relief by setting up a canopy or sun umbrella when darkness descends light up your beach area with candles lanterns and tiki torches use string lights to add a magical fairy light feel 14 x research source make a sandbox on top of the beach with an inflatable pool an inflatable pool will keep sand from spreading out in a thin layer making this a perfect place to build sandcastles if kids are around they ll love it include a small bucket plastic shovel and other sandcastle making tools if you re not a fan of playing in the sand why not fill the pool with a small amount of water to cool off your feet when the weather s hot not a sandbox or pool fan use a decorative fountain instead the sound of flowing water will have a calming effect 15 x research source play sounds of the beach with a playlist or music station you should be able to find beach themed tracks on youtube or a music platform like spotify or pandora many white noise makers have an ocean sounds track that you can use to evoke the sense of a nearby body of water even when your eyes are closed calypso and reggae are styles of music often associated with tropical climates 16 x research source hook up some speakers and play this music to accompany your beach scene add finishing touches with beach themed items scatter shells on tables and use woven wicker mats for placemats if you have a small piece of driftwood you might use it as a table centerpiece larger pieces can be arranged around plants and rocks to make the scene appear freshly washed ashore beach toys scattered about like beach balls floaties and surfboards will give the impression of a fun beachside scene 17 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to build a fallout shelter,a fallout shelter protects you and your family after a nuclear attack or disaster you can begin building a simple shelter by digging a trench and covering it with roofing logs and dirt this type of shelter called a pole covered trench shelter is waterproof and radiation resistant when constructed properly though you hopefully will never have to use the shelter you can rest easy knowing you are prepared for anything,choose a building area on stable ground away from obstructions when a nuclear weapon detonates it creates a thermal pulse which can set things 20 mi 32 km away on fire you can often build a shelter in your backyard if you can position it so that both rainwater and water behind dams runs away from it you will also need to consider where the utility lines are in your area so you don t disturb them 1 x research source try to select stable ground where trees and buildings won t fall on your shelter if you re in a city you can build a reinforced shelter in a basement the concrete can protect you from fallout and falling debris research the topography of your area your government s local land survey office will have them available also check with the emergency response office avoid positioning your shelter downhill from bodies of water or below steep slopes keep it clear of flammable buildings print out a blueprint for the shelter you want to make having a clear blueprint will help you construct a stable effective shelter you can find some basic plans simply by searching for fallout shelter blueprints online some plans may even include a step by step overview for building the shelter 2 x research source you can also get blueprints by consulting an architect or drafter they can provide guidance on what shelter best suits your needs most building construction companies can build a shelter for you even if you don t want to hire someone to design a shelter sketch your own plans before beginning construction you can try using a computer program like sketchup stake out and clear the building area for construction plot out the shelter s perimeter according to your blueprint plant a series of wooden stakes in the ground to outline the shelter s perimeter then use shovels axes and other tools to dig up grass trees rocks and other debris in the area 3 x research source clear the land about 10 ft 3 0 m beyond the shelter s perimeter so you have plenty of space to work with the shelter s size is up to you expect to add about 3 ft 0 91 m to the shelter s length for every person who will hide there a basic 4 person shelter is about 10 10 10 ft 3 0 3 0 3 0 m in size dig a trench and move the dirt out of the excavation area begin digging out soil to form the basic outline of your shelter you can do this with shovels although it takes a lot of time and labor move the excavated dirt 10 ft 3 0 m beyond the stakes you will need to keep the dirt away so it doesn t fall back into the trench 4 x research source for quicker work rent a backhoe from an equipment company near you this can get pricey but speeding up the excavation process is often worth it digging a deeper trench means more space and blast protection for your shelter create an emergency exit at the far end of the trench the emergency exit will also serve as extra ventilation at the end of the trench dig a crawl space about 2 ft 0 61 m wide and 3 1 2 ft 1 1 m deep the crawl space will be right below the soil s surface create an exit at the end by digging a small trench to connect the crawl space to the outside world 5 x research source you can build dirt steps as needed to reach the surface pile dirt near the entryway then begin digging into it with a shovel shape the dirt into small steps lay threshold boards over each steps connecting them to side boards with 10 in 25 cm lag bolts always have a second exit in your shelter to guard against emergencies make a second crawl way for the entrance create the main entryway the same way you built the emergency exit this time dig on the opposite end of the shelter you can make this entryway a little wider so you have an easier time entering the shelter keep the entryway below ground emerging away from the shelter s main living quarters 6 x research source the main entrance will not have air pumps or ventilation pipes running through it so it may appear larger by default lay wooden roofing poles side by side over the trench get poles that overhang the trench by at least 2 ft 0 61 m so they are less likely to collapse lay them across the trench s width push the logs as close together as possible to reduce the gaps in the shelter s roof 7 x research source for example try using 9 ft 2 7 m poles over a trench 5 ft 1 5 m wide roofing poles are basically long uncut pieces of timber you can get them from lumber yards roofing suppliers and home improvement stores may also be able to help stack poles in front of the entryways to keep dirt out of them lay a few 6 ft 1 8 m wooden roofing poles between the trench and the edge of each entryway use about 3 or 4 logs on each side tie them together with strong rope or wire also binding them to the closest poles hanging over the trench 8 x research source these entryway poles hold back the dirt you will use to create the shelter ceiling if you don t have them in place the dirt can slide into the entryways blocking them waterproof the logs with a tarp or another plastic material make sure you cover any gaps between the logs so water and dirt can t fall into the shelter you can do this easily by purchasing a tarp large enough to fit over the trench also try overlapping a few smaller tarps 9 x research source you can also fill the gaps with cloth leaves clay or other alternative materials cover the logs with an 18 in 46 cm earth dome begin moving the excavated dirt back on top of the logs make sure the dirt is unable to leak into the living space below the logs as you pile up the dirt shape it into a rounded mound ending right before the shelter s entrances the mound shape will give your shelter s roof plenty of stability to prevent it from caving in 10 x research source for extra radiation protection make the dome deeper try placing a second plastic tarp layer over the dome then pile up another 18 in 46 cm of dirt pack the earth around the entryways to seal out water stack a few shorter roofing poles or sandbags around each entrance tie them down tightly with rope or wire then build up the earth around the poles into slopes 6 in 15 cm deep to drive water away from the entryways 11 x research source make the slopes on all sides of each entryway to ensure that rainwater never enters the shelter hang plastic canopies over the entryways to protect them from water extend a plastic tarp from the roof dome over the entryway sink a few stakes in the dome then tie the tarp in place with strong cords or wires secure the other end of the tarp to the logs or sandbags stacked in front of the entryway to further waterproof your shelter 12 x research source make sure the tarps form a tent shape they need to form a consistent slope so water rolls away from your shelter install a hand operated ventilation pump in the emergency exit choose a ventilation pump with a pipe about 20 in 51 cm wide and 36 in 91 cm tall place the filter on the floor next to the emergency exit then run the pipe along the crawl space letting it emerge preferably above the plastic canopy 13 x research source always use a pump with an option for manual operation the pump will run on its own most of the time but in case of an emergency you can operate it to keep the shelter s air clean set up a toilet in a separate area of the shelter you have several options for installing toilets the most efficient way is a composting toilet similar to what you would see in an rv you will need to install a ventilation pipe running it from the toilet to the surface a good location for the toilet is near the exit furthest from your sleeping quarters 14 x research source to install the ventilation pipe run it through the nearest entryway if possible you may need to dig through the dirt so the pipe exits above the plastic canopy over the entryway you can also try joining the pipe to the air pump s ventilation pipe many shelters do not feature running water so a regular toilet isn t usually an option you may not be able to get clean running water in an emergency so you may need to install an expensive system of tanks pipes and filters if you want more comfort another option is to use small plastic toilets or buckets it isn t ideal but it is an effective way to keep your shelter safe and sanitary seal the buckets and carry them to the surface as needed make beds and other furniture for the shelter with a pole covered trench shelter the best way to set up furniture is to make hammocks loop strong rope or wire around the ceiling poles connect the rope or wire to cloth to create strong but lightweight hammocks you can also try assembling poles and boards together to create bunk beds 15 x research source you do not have to buy bulky furniture get creative and craft your own furniture or assemble makeshift bedding for example you can make a bed by piling blankets even packing together leaves pine needle or hay is a fast inexpensive way to create a bed pack food water and other necessities food and water are the most important supplies so keep them in abundance plan on having at least 1 us gal 3 8 l of water per person per day keep a supply of dry food that will last you about 2 weeks also bring along medical supplies disposal bins and extra clothing 16 x research source you will generally need to be in the shelter for around 3 days but plan on staying up to a month in case of a serious emergency get a good first aid kit that includes bandages tape splints scissors rubbing alcohol and any medication you need for food bring things that don t require a lot of preparation such as lentils jerky and military mres find a room made out of concrete the best shelter rooms are underground although you can convert any concrete room into a shelter a basement is often a great place for a shelter also look for concrete office buildings or other protected structures unlikely to collapse during an event 17 x research source if you have to make an indoors shelter try to choose a room closer to the middle of the building this will put as much space between you and the fallout as possible you can also build a separate concrete room or shelter outside shield the walls with heavy materials like sandbags if you have time stack sandbags near windows and other spots where radiation can leak in the more you cover the walls the more protection you have against radiation makeshift materials like mattresses tables books and even bags of clothes help during an emergency 18 x research source stock the shelter with food and other necessities plan on keeping enough supplies for at least 3 days fill it with clean bottled water and snacks that don t require much preparation be sure to include medical supplies and prescription medication you will also need a sanitation bucket 19 x research source a radio is handy and you can use it to listen to updates it may help you decide when leaving the shelter is safe leave small vents for air at the entrances seal up the entrances with sandbags or other resistant material leave a small gap so that everyone in the shelter has enough air to breathe 20 x research source also consider installing an air ventilation pump you may be able to connect it to ventilation pipes already installed in the building,Home-and-Garden
how to paint a pool,paint is one of the most common pool surfaces it comes in a variety of colors and is an inexpensive alternative to the more elaborate surface options when attempting to paint a pool one must first select the proper paint prepare the pool properly and follow all manufacturer s application guidelines with the right materials and some time and effort you can have a brand new swimming pool without breaking the bank,purchase the same type of paint previously used on your pool surface epoxy chlorinated rubber or acrylic 1 x research source remove a chip and have it tested by your local paint dealer to determine the type of paint that was used drain all of the water from the pool and remove any leaves dirt or debris 2 x research source caulk or patch any existing cracks and holes with hydraulic cement follow the cement manufacturer s instructions clean the concrete surface 3 x research source remove any old paint by using a power washer or a scraper and wire brush ensure that all loose paint has been removed then sweep the area clean use an acid wash mixture of 50 water and 50 muriatic acid to clean the pool surface thoroughly scrub the walls and floor with a scrub brush then rinse the entire surface with clean water clean the surface again with tri sodium phosphate tsp to neutralize the acid and remove dense areas of oil or grease rinse it completely with fresh water re rinse the entire pool including drains lights stairs etc pump out any standing water and allow 3 to 5 days for the pool surface to dry only acrylic paint can be applied to damp surfaces 4 x research source apply the paint with an extension roller start in the deep end and work your way into the low end of the pool use a brush to cut in on the tight areas around pool fixtures such as lights drains and valves allow the paint to dry per the manufacturer s instructions particularly when using an epoxy paint as timing is crucial to proper adhesion typically you must wait 3 to 5 days for the paint to dry before refilling the pool with water 5 x research source refill the newly painted pool with water and adjust the filter and chemical settings to ensure proper maintenance,Home-and-Garden
how to grow your own food,for all of human history people have managed to feed themselves either by fishing hunting gathering or subsistence farming nowadays we can simply head to the grocery store to

how to install a light fixture,installing a new light fixture requires careful planning and attention to detail there s no room for error when it comes to electrical wiring which means you ve got to organize properly and learn the regulations to make sure your project is safe and up to code you can learn to plan your project and install new wiring to light your home,check your local wiring codes and schedule inspections several inspections and permits are required for most residential construction projects especially when it involves installing or replacing new wires simply replacing a fixture usually does not require permits and inspection 1 x research source to make sure you re up to code you may need to schedule the following with the housing administration in your city or country a temporary service inspection rough in inspection final inspection even if you re not doing it yourself any electrical work done by a subcontractor needs to be be inspected usually both rough in and final inspections for example well pumps or external wood fired furnaces decide what type of fixture will work best in the area you re trying to illuminate you wouldn t want to light up a workshop in the same way you d light up a nursery or a kitchen the same way you d light living room think about the purpose of the room to determine where and how you ll light it is it a place for sitting and reading quietly a sconce or wall mounted fixture might be most appropriate is it in the kitchen where you need good directed lighting like over a kitchen island in this case pendant lighting would be ideal to highlight your cooking prep 2 x research source for most jobs you ll be working with one of a few different locations for a new fixture typically you ll install fixtures in the wall in the ceiling or in a pole mount if you re undertaking work that requires close examination like craft or sewing you ll need to consider having both general led can recessed lighting and task lighting pendant fixtures lamps etc the task lighting focuses directly on your work while the general good quality lighting helps dispel shadowing and makes the room comfortable to be in 3 x

unique color tone or range of color tones form which to choose 4 x research source the tones and varieties of bulbs are expressed as a temperature in degrees kelvin warm tones yellow red have lower temperature 2000 while cool tones blue have higher temperatures 8300 for reference purposes daylight is generally accepted to be about 5600 if you re looking for more intimate or relaxing go for warm white around 2700 degrees would be appropriate for the purpose 5 x research source if you re looking for a work light cool white or daylight is better these bulbs are around 4000 degrees when changing a bulb you should obtain one with the same temperature light otherwise colors in the room will be cooler or warmer depending on the tone of the light source this is even more noticeable if there are two or more adjacent lamps of different temperatures determine voltage and current requirements for the fixture the fixture must operate on a voltage available at the location nearly all fixtures available at home centers in north america will be the 120 volt variety or have the ability to choose from two or more voltages by connecting specific wires and leaving others disconnected current requirements for 120 volt incandescent fixtures this includes tungsten quartz halogen is 83 amps per 100 watts a 100 watt fixture can usually be added to existing circuits without incident most fixtures will list a wattage or amperage requirement to avoid overloading the circuit locate a suitable power source find a nearby outlet or an existing junction box in the ceiling that s close enough to branch out from 6 x research source if a suitable power source isn t easily available you might have to run a new branch from the electrical panel it s important to find suitable power sources that are close by it s unlikely that you ll be able to use the basement electrical source to feed a switch on the third floor to operate a fixture that illuminates the front sidewalk that s a lot of wiring plan the wiring route 7 x research source there are three possible ways to wire the circuit for a new installation power to switch power to fixture and installing the power and load point at same switch the three points source switch and fixture need to be connected together all with simple two wire romex cable when there is one switch controlling the fixture if you re wiring multiple switches to multiple fixtures it s important to separate your wring systems to keep them straight the fixtures need to be wired to each other with a two wire cable and the switches need to be wired to each other with a three wire cable the power source can be brought to either of the three way switch boxes or any fixture box with two wire cable the cable between the switch and fixture s is also 2 wire type but must be run from either three way switch box to the fixture box that has the power source do not deviate from the requirement cut openings for the wiring cut openings into the ceiling or wall surfaces for the boxes for the switch es and for the fixture support by first tracing around the box on the wall or ceiling surface 8 x research source be sure to match the switch box height to those in the rest of your home if a fixture is to be installed in the ceiling the box should be a 4 octagon box it is important to note that even if a small light fixture is planned to be installed here consider installing a fan rated box as a paddle fan might be installed here in the future if installing recessed light fixtures no box is installed as a wiring compartment is provided on the fixture itself the open to be cut in the ceiling is provided by the template included with the fixture by most manufacturers or by tracing around the rough in housing opening install the wiring install the romex or other cable between the power source and boxes in the voids of the walls ceilings and floors with a snake or fish tape 9 x research source after determining there is enough ampacity in the circuit to support the additional load extend wiring of the same size from the power source to the switch and fixture locations if running a new circuit directly from the electrical panel the new wire should be sized according to the fuse or circuit breaker size make sure your wiring is up to code national electrical code requirements for wiring need to be followed closely when you re installing a new fixture when you re selecting wire for the job make sure it fits the following constraints a wire smaller than 14 copper is not permitted for power wiring smaller wires 28 through 16 are permitted for low voltage applications such as thermostats and zone valves in gas oil fired heating systems door bells and buttons alarm systems telephones networking etc these wires never enter electrical panels a 15 amp circuit breaker or fuse should have no less than a 14 gauge copper wire connected a 15 amp circuit is designed to safely carry up to 12 amps continuously on a 14 copper wire intermittent loads of up to 15 amps can be carrier for up to several hours 10 x research source if the load of any device or appliance is greater than 12 amps a larger size wire and circuit breaker is required a 20 amp circuit breaker or fuse should have no less than a 12 gauge copper wire connected a 20 amp circuit is designed to safely carry up to 16 amps continuously on a 12 copper wire 11 x research source intermittent loads of up to 20 amps can be carrier for up to several hours if the load of any device or appliance is greater than 16 amps a larger wire and circuit breaker is required

how to make a pot in a pot refrigerator,in a community or situation without electricity storage of food long term can be tricky one simple solution is to build your own pot in pot fridge using basic pots sand and water an idea revived by mohammed bah abba this refrigerator is now being used by many farmers in warm climates who need to preserve their food for a longer time and keep the insects away keeping the sand moist all the time enables evaporation to cool the produce kept inside the inner pot this enables the storage of freshly grown vegetables to last much longer than usual in a hot climate it is also great for using at a picnic or outdoor meal where there is no electricity outside but food or drinks need to be kept cool here is how to make your own,obtain two large clay or terracotta pots one pot must be smaller than the other pot check that the smaller pot fits inside the larger and that there is a space around it of at least one centimetre up to three centimetres fill in any holes at the base of the pots use clay large pebbles cork a homemade paste anything suitable to hand to fill the hole if you leave the holes open the water will enter the inner pot and will also run out of the larger pot making the fridge ineffective 1 x research source putty or duct tape can plug the hole fill the base of the larger pot with coarse sand fill about 2 5cm 1 inch deep and only fill to a height that will ensure the smaller pot sits even in height with the larger pot 2 x research source place the small clay pot into the large pot arrange its base flat on top of the lower layer of sand fill all around the small pot with sand fill it almost all the way except for leaving a small gap at the top pour cold water over the sand do this until the sand is completely soaked and unable to take any more water as you pour do so gradually in order to give the water time to soak into the terracotta 3 x research source take a cloth tea towel or towel and dip it into water place it over the top of the inner pot so that it covers it completely 4 x research source wet hessian or similar fabric also works well allow the inner pot to cool down if you have a thermometer you can use this otherwise test the temperature with your hands keep the pot in pot refrigerator in a dry ventilated space for the water to evaporate effectively towards the outside 5 x research source place vegetables or other items inside for storage 6 x research source you will need to keep checking regularly for the dampness of the sand pour in more water as it becomes drier to keep it well moistened usually this will need to be done twice a day you can add food or drinks to the pot in pot refrigerator if you re having an outdoor party or picnic make one for the drinks and one for the food if you have a lot of items,Home-and-Garden
how to determine how much water plants need,gardening is a fun and rewarding hobby however sometimes it may be difficult to determine exactly how much water a specific plant needs this is because the needs of a plant may vary based on how you grow it the environment the soil type and more ultimately determining how much water a plant needs is a scientific process in which you ll have to engage in a lot of trial and error by looking for signs of overwatering avoiding underwatering and researching the specific plant you have a question about you ll be better equipped to determine how much water a plant needs,provide water based on the native environment of the plant determine where the plant grows in the wild then provide water based on that environment or ecosystem for example if a plant is native to a tropical region and you live in a semi arid environment you ll need to provide a lot more water to it than to plants that are native to your region 1 x research source if you re in a dry location like the desert southwest provide more water to fruit and vegetable bearing plants than you would native plants in addition give more water to ferns and non native flowering plants if you re in a tropical environment you may not need to provide any extra water to fruit and vegetable bearing plants if you re in a temperate environment research the specific plant especially if it is fruit or vegetable bearing to verify it gets enough water soak the area around a plant after you put it in the ground plants you ve just transferred into a new pot or piece of ground should have their roots and the dirt around them soaked immediately for the first week provide water every other day after the first week monitor the plant closely to make sure the soil stays damp provide extra water if the soil is dry 2 x research source at all times in summer this can require watering once or even twice a day test the moisture with your finger stick your finger into the soil around your plant up to the first knuckle if the dirt feels cool damp or moist it has enough water if it feels dry it may need more water 3 x expert source maggie moran horticulturist expert interview use drip irrigation for plants with shallow roots if you have a particular plant with shallow roots you should set up a drip irrigation system this system will slowly release water over a longer period of time as a result plants with shallow roots will have better access to water 4 x trustworthy source food and agricultural organization of the united nations specialized agency of the united nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition go to source drip irrigation is especially useful for fruit and vegetable bearing plants in arid environments tomatoes strawberries and peppers will benefit immensely from drip irrigation ask an expert or someone at a nursery if you have trouble providing enough water to a plant you may want to contact someone who has experience dealing with it nursery employees arborists or plant biologists may be able to provide insight into how much water a specific plant needs read about the specific plant find a book or visit a website that has information about the specific plant you have a question about for example if you re concerned about providing enough water to your tomato plants find a book on tomato plants and the variety you intend to grow and see what the book suggests 5 x research source use a soil moisture meter purchase a moisture meter and stick it into the soil near your plant leave the meter there and use it to monitor the soil the meter will indicate whether the soil is dry moist or wet most plants will thrive if the soil is somewhat moist some meters have a 1 to 10 scale on them the numbers 1 to 3 indicate dry 4 to 7 indicate moist and 8 to 10 indicate wet many plants tend to do well in the 4 to 5 range tomatoes do great in the 5 to 6 range once you ve determined the optimum moisture range for your plant use the meter to stay within it 6 x research source look for standing water at the bottom of the container if your plant is in some sort of container check to see if there is a lot of water built up at the bottom pooled water is a tell tale sign of overwatering this is important as too much water at the bottom of the container could cause root rot and other problems 7 x research source if the pot has standing water try putting it on top of a layer of stones this will help it drain more efficiently check to see if roots at the bottom of the pot are rotting tip up the plant container or dig down to the bottom of the plant if you notice that the roots are brown grey black or slimy they re probably oversaturated with water instead healthy roots should be white solid and crisp 8 x research source root rot is especially common in soils with pour drainage such as soil that contains clay watch carefully for root rot if you re growing vegetables like lettuce beans beets carrots or onions look for green yellow and brown leaves falling off the plant 9 x expert source maggie moran horticulturist expert interview if the soil is moist and you notice leaves falling off the plant you may be overwatering it in this instance water less 10 x research source test soil drainage if you re working with plants in the ground you ll need to do a little work to make sure your soil drains properly to do this dig a one foot deep hole in the ground fill the hole with water and allow it to drain then fill the hole with water again and time how long it takes to drain your results will give you an idea of how well the soil drains if the water drains in less than 4 minutes most trees and plants should do okay there if the soil drains in 5 to 15 minutes most trees and plants will thrive if the soil drains in 16 to 60 minutes plants that need well drained soil will need a lot less water than in other soil if the soil takes hours to drain only plants that grow in swamps or along bodies of water will live 11 x research source watch to see if the plant is wilting wilting leaves and stems may be a sign that you are under watering your plants wilting leaves usually appear limp weak and seem to hang downward healthy leaves should appear crisp and firm ultimately if your plant is wilting you may need to give it more water 12 x research source while it is more likely a sign of underwatering wilting can also be a sign of overwatering to properly determine whether wilting indicates underwatering or overwatering consider other factors such as soil moisture usually if the soil is dry and the plant is wilting it needs more water wilting leaves are an important indication that fruit and vegetable bearing plants may produce low yields or experience other problems check to see if the soil is damp 3 to 4 inches 7 6 to 10 cm deep as a rule the soil for most plants should be somewhat moist about 3 to 4 inches deep 7 6 to 10 cm 13 x expert source maggie moran horticulturist expert interview this is important as you need to make sure moisture reaches the roots of the plant if the soil is not moist below 3 or 4 inches 7 6 to 10 cm your plant may not be getting enough water 14 x research source this is especially important for tomatoes strawberries and other fruits that depend on a lot of water provide 1 inch of water 2 5 cm per week to vegetables whether you re growing in some sort of container or in a garden bed provide about 1 inch 2 5 cm of water a week if you re in an arid climate provide 2 inches 5 cm in addition if you re in an extra hot environment add about ½ 1 25 cm for every 10 degrees above 60 degrees it is okay if this water is provided artificially or through rain calculate the average temperature of your area by adding the daytime high and the nighttime low then divide this by 2 for example if the low is 60 and the high is 80 you ll compute the average temperature as 70 degrees if you re in a temperate climate you d want to provide 1 5 inches 3 8 cm of water per week 15 x research source measure the water your plants get purchase a rain gauge at your local hardware store then place the rain gauge in your garden pay attention to how much water collects in the gauge after it has rained or you have watered your plants if the amount of water the area around your plant gets is less than the recommended amount for the plant and climate provide more water by installing sprinklers or making your own drip irrigator 16 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to dumpster dive,as the saying goes one man s trash is another man s treasure though it may strike some people as an odd practice dumpster diving or scavenging for useful items in waste receptacles is a great way to make sure that perfectly good items aren t going to waste dumpster diving doesn t require any special skill or equipment but it will benefit you to be aware some of the risks and learn the best way to go about it to avoid illness or legal trouble whether you re looking to furnish your home stock your refrigerator or turn trash into cash learning the ins and outs of dumpster diving can make your searches more fruitful,familiarize yourself with your local laws before you jump in headfirst it will be worth knowing the legal risks you face for reclaiming waste items from public containers in most places trash is not considered private property so it s unlikely that you ll be charged with theft however it s possible for dumpster divers to be targeted for other offenses such as invasion of privacy trespassing or vagrancy 1 x research source dumpster diving is generally frowned upon in polite society even in places where it s technically legal if there are fences locks or no trespassing signs on the premises consider yourself warned it may be wise to stay away from locations under tight scrutiny scope out the dumpsters in your area as most people already know you can typically find trash receptacles outside of major businesses but you might also expand your hunting radius to include urban neighborhoods schools churches and public locations like parks and beaches to avoid detection look for dumpsters that aren t in plain sight look up the trash pickup times in your city so you can have a chance to go through a promising receptacle before it s emptied 2 x research source plan your runs for the early morning or evening hours when most people are occupied 3 x research source know what sorts of items to look for public trash disposal sites often contain a wealth of treasures just waiting to be claimed thrifty divers have been known to uncover designer clothing valuable scrap materials and even expensive out of date electronics in the refuse of high end establishments having a basic idea of what s out there and where you re likely to find it will help you focus your search 4 x research source if you re looking for a specific type of find the smartest place to look is at the source for example you ll have a much better chance stumbling upon unused beauty products behind a cosmetics boutique or turning up small electronics at an office supply store 5 x research source keep an eye out for old unwanted furniture and appliances near dumpsters in residential areas prepare yourself mentally willing yourself to climb into a hot smelly dumpster isn t always easy since most people have an aversion to objects like garbage that they find disgusting it can help to take a few moments to collect yourself before setting out remember why you re doing what you re doing and keep in mind that playing a part in helping eliminate unnecessary waste 6 x research source dumpster diving can be messy work it may not be the best pastime for the faint of heart or those with weak stomachs dress appropriately there s a good chance that whatever you wear is going to get dirty or torn so wear older garments that you don t mind ruining comfortable clothing will allow you to move around freely which can be helpful should you have to do any climbing or other maneuvering it s also a good idea to pull on a pair of thick soled closed toed shoes or boots to protect your feet from sharp exposed edges 7 x research source wear pants and tops with long sleeves to minimize your exposure to unsanitary messes 8 x research source if you re going to actually enter the dumpster wear sturdy fabrics like denim nylon or leather and keep as much of your body covered as possible remove any accessories you don t want to lose before you get inside equip other useful gear feel free to bring along anything else that you think might come in handy like a pair of thick gloves or a small stepping stool or milk crate to help you get up into the dumpster night dives should be accompanied by a flashlight or headlamp to make it easier to see don t forget to also bring some kind of spacious container to stash your discoveries in 9 x research source a durable canvas laundry bag can make a great way to transport your finds back home use a long pole to poke around in the trash until something catches your attention if you re careful enough there may be no need to get inside the receptacle at all flashlights may also be necessary during the daytime if the dumpster is especially deep or situated in the shade take only what you can realistically use while you may be tempted to bring back anything and everything of potential value from your dive it s best to limit your haul to the things you have a specific need for otherwise useless items will just accumulate and eventually find their way into the trash again organize your finds into a few separate piles things you can use things other people might be able to use and things you can sell 10 x research source if you don t find anything worth keeping cut your losses and move on to the next spot stay vigilant as mentioned dumpster diving is looked upon with notoriety if you re not paying attention you may end up being surprised by random onlookers business owners or even the police keep a watchful eye over your surroundings at all times or have a friend or fellow dumpster diver on standby to signal you if someone approaches 11 x research source spend as little time in the area as you can get in get the goods and get out 12 x research source be ready to abandon your hunt at a moment s notice don t leave behind a mess if you ve removed anything from the dumpster during your search be sure to return it before you go on your way while you re at it look around for other trash nearby that you can throw away try to leave the area as clean or even cleaner than you found it 13 x research source giving away your presence makes you more likely to be caught red handed on future visits the goal is to economize not to vandalize don t give dumpster diving a bad name go where the food is if you set out with the goal of replenishing your pantry it will be helpful to know where to go for salvageable food items that aren t an obvious health hazard you can almost always find something of use behind restaurants and supermarkets cafes and bakeries are another dependable source as they re required to dispose of freshly prepared food items at the end of the day most of the time these items won t have been left sitting long enough to have gone bad 14 x research source a good general rule is to start your search at a place that sells the type of food you re looking for dumpster diving at popular stores and restaurants is best left for the nighttime hours when you re less likely to be noticed 15 x research source salvage preserved food items first things packaged in boxes jars and wrappers tend to last longer than fresh foods because they receive less exposure to the bacteria in the air these sorts of goods should always be your first choice when on the hunt for a meal look for items that are still in their airtight packaging like canned tuna or individually wrapped granola bars 16 x research source avoid anything that s not sealed or has been previously opened canned and dried goods such as uncooked rice oats and pasta usually stay good for several months after their listed expiration date 17 x research source use out of date foods immediately a bag of soft avocados or a case of mayonnaise may still be safe to eat but you should try to find something to do with them right away the best way to make various edible discoveries stretch if they re nearing or just past their prime is to incorporate them into other foods for instance a bunch of brown bananas isn t particularly appetizing on its own but it will go perfectly in a loaf of bread or a fruit smoothie 18 x research source cook as much of what you bring back as you can this will kill off the harmful bacteria that begins to reproduce when food spoils and may also level out stale and unpleasant flavors 19 x trustworthy source foodsafety gov online portal combining food safety information from the u s food and drug administration the food safety and inspection service and the centers for disease control and prevention go to source most types of produce can be canned pickled or turned into jams or jellies effectively extending their lifespan stay away from questionable items it should go without saying but use your common sense if you come across food that s noticeably rotten or has a foul odor don t eat it the majority of meats dairy products fruits and vegetables that find their way into the garbage fit into this category though they re enticing perishables are invariably the first to go bad you re better off setting your sights on foods that fare well in a wide range of storage conditions and using your best judgment 20 x research source if you do decide to take it with you anyway double check it for signs of mold or tampering first and be aware of the risk you re taking to your health never consume frozen or refrigerated items after they ve thawed to room temperature this could make you extremely sick 21 x research source rummage through trash receptacles cautiously you never know what might be lurking at the bottom of a dumpster or recycling bin broken glass rotting food hazardous materials and other types of waste all pose a potential threat to your health proceed slowly and cautiously while sifting through unidentified rubbish especially if it s hard to see what s around you 22 x research source prop open the lid of the dumpster or have a friend hold it for you so you can work unimpeded 23 x research source watch out for pests trash receptacles are sometimes home to rats opossums raccoons and other scavengers when startled or provoked these animals may be motivated to attack give the inside of the dumpster a quick once over before climbing inside to avoid a surprise encounter with a potentially dangerous pest banging the outside of the dumpster may also help scare off any unwanted company if the dumpster you re attempting to search is inhabited by critters the safest option is to just move on to the next location scavenger rodents are known for carrying diseases that can prove fatal to humans if contracted keep your distance at all costs bathe yourself immediately as soon as you get back home hop in the shower to clean off any dirt and germs you may have encountered during your dive wash with hot water and an antibacterial soap and don t forget to shampoo pay special attention to areas that tend to get missed like inside your ears and beneath your fingernails prolonged or unsafe exposure to garbage can lead to a host of health concerns 24 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source contrary to popular belief a solid personal hygiene regimen is very important for dumpster divers arguably even more important than for normal people clean retrieved items thoroughly soak non electronic finds with warm water and a strong disinfectant to kill bacteria and remove mold and other residue rinse salvageable foodstuffs like produce and packaged snacks with clean water then store them properly or cook and use them immediately after a good cleaning most discoveries will be restored to top shape 25 x research source spot clean electronics with a washcloth and rubbing

how to save paper,trees are an essential part of the planet s ecosystem they provide oxygen clean the air provide shade and food and they re used as homes by many different creatures to create paper and other wood products millions of new trees must be planted each year even so logging can be very destructive to the environment if it pollutes nearby water leads to soil erosion contributes to habitat loss and uses a great deal of energy to help reduce logging there are many things you can do at home school and work to cut down on paper consumption,use reusable cloths instead of paper products around the house a lot of paper is wasted every year on things like paper towels and napkins and if you re using lots of paper products for cleaning drying and wiping your nose you can save plenty of trees by switching to reusable versions 1 x research source to replace paper towels in the kitchen and bathroom use tea towels to dry dishes old rags to clean and sponges to wipe up spills to replace facial tissues invest in a few handkerchiefs that can be washed and reused to replace napkins at the dinner table purchase cloth napkins instead which can be washed and reused as well use real dinnerware instead of paper paper plates and dishes may be convenient but they aren t good for the environment most paper plates just end up in the trash meaning the paper isn t even recycled properly when you have a party or any time the paper plates come out ask to use the real dinnerware instead if your family likes to go on picnics or camping trips invest in reusable plastic dinnerware you can get plates bowls cups and utensils that are durable unbreakable reusable and not made from paper use paper from other plant sources there are times when it s simply not possible to avoid paper like products luckily there are tree free paper products available that are made from alternative plant sources and many of these have a lower impact on the environment hemp is a versatile plant that grows much faster than a tree and produces more fiber hemp can be turned into fabric writing paper greeting cards envelopes and other paper products bamboo is another fast growing species of plant that can be used for alternative paper products you can find bamboo bathroom tissue paper towels and even disposable dinnerware bring your own thermos or reusable mug to cafes disposable paper cups from cafes and restaurants are another way that lots of paper is wasted every year like paper plates many paper cups end up in the trash because they are not recyclable they are usually coated with plastic in the case of uncoated paper cups they are soiled with liquid any time you go to a restaurant or cafe for a takeout drink take a reusable coffee mug or thermos with you for coffee hot chocolate or other warm beverages use reusable grocery and lunch bags many grocery stores provide paper bags to pack groceries you can help your family save paper by investing in reusable grocery bags similarly if your lunches are normally packed in paper bags ask about switching to a reusable lunch bag instead if your family is hesitant about switching ask them to consider how much money they spend on paper bags and grocery bags every year then compare that to the one time cost of reusable bags send e cards lots of people like to send greeting cards for birthdays holidays and other events and this leads to plenty of paper waste not only is the card itself paper but it s also sent in a paper envelope instead of sending paper greeting cards to all your friends and family in the mail send electronic greeting cards for future celebrations there are lots of e card services out there that allow you to personalize designs messages and graphics to suit your taste and the type of celebration e cards are also great for sending out invitations to parties weddings and other events read e books or library books books are great resources for school and work projects and they re great to read as a leisure activity but printed books are still made with paper so you can save paper by using public versions of books that are available at the library or by reading electronic copies instead buying used books is also a good idea because you re reusing something that s already been printed use computers instead of notebooks for school and work school and work notebooks are a great way to keep track of things you re supposed to learn and projects you re working on but you can save paper by keeping electronic notes instead that way you don t have to rely on paper notebooks and you can always have your notes saved to your computer if you re in school ask your teacher if it s ok that you take notes on a computer or laptop instead of in a notebook don t use products that come with excessive packaging one of the biggest culprits for creating paper waste is consumer packaging that s used to wrap and label food toys clothes and other goods to help save paper buy products that have been made with minimal or no packaging many of today s consumer items are wrapped multiple times such as a candy that comes in an individual wrapper within a bag that s also placed inside a box instead look for packaging that has a sticker instead of a full box for instance or a tag instead of an entire container similarly buy items that haven t been wrapped multiple times buying in bulk is a good way to reduce paper waste from packaging next time you or your family go shopping make sure you take reusable bags and buy what you can in bulk dine in instead of using takeout containers at restaurants another large contributor to paper waste is takeout food containers which are often made of paper products or packed in paper bags next time you and your family decide to eat out for a meal request that you sit down in the restaurant instead of taking the food in to go containers most fast food restaurants use paper products to individually wrap all food so ask your family if you can eat at a conventional sit down restaurant for your next night out be selective about what you print at home at school and work you can save paper by cutting down on the amount of material you print off before you print anything ask yourself if you really need a paper copy and only print something if you must when you do need to print something off reduce the font increase the margins and print on both sides of the paper so the project can be printed on fewer pieces of paper 2 x research source if teachers and employers require that you hand in paper copies of projects and assignments ask if you can instead submit them electronically before you print off an assignment letter or personal project proofread it on the computer so you don t have to print off a second draft send receive and store electronic records instead of paper copies most documents these days can be shared and stored electronically meaning you don t have to print off paper copies for your records for instance if you need a copy of an electronic document request that it be sent to you by email for sensitive documents that shouldn t be emailed ask if you can save a copy directly to a flash drive in the case where an original paper copy already exists and you need a record for your files scan a version to your computer instead of making a photocopy 3 x research source when you need to provide copies of documents to friends family teachers or people at work ask if you can transmit files electronically using sharing services email or other electronic methods opt for paperless communications many companies and organizations offer electronic correspondences that can replace paper copies they traditionally send in the mail 4 x research source whenever possible sign up for paperless communications for items like bills newsletters monthly mailings flyers and coupons newspaper and magazine subscriptions use electronic calendars and day timers there are plenty of free calendars and schedulers available online that you can use to plan your days keep track of dates and assignments and schedule meetings and interviews by using an electronic calendar you can save the paper that would have been used on a calendar organizer journal or other type of scheduler both google and apple provide free calendar products there are also plenty of calendar apps that you can use on smartphones or tablets encourage others to save paper to have an even bigger impact you can also encourage friends family classmates and coworkers to save paper as well one of the best ways to reach the most people is to put up signs around the house school or office that inform people how they can help there are lots of signs that you can print off from the internet that will help raise awareness about the importance of saving trees the wwf has signs you can download and print make sure you print or draw your signs on reused paper like the back of an old assignment trash containers and recycling bins are a great place for signs buy recycled paper products there are paper products available that are made with recycled paper which means that no new trees were cut down to make those products when you do need to buy paper products look for things that were made with post consumer waste including bathroom tissues printing paper greeting cards paper bags use both sides of a piece of paper when you do have to print or write things down on paper make sure you get the most out of that paper by writing on both sides if you currently only use one side of each piece you can cut down on paper use by half just by using the other side too 5 x research source writing or printing in a smaller size or font will also help you cut down on the amount of paper you need for notes and projects when writing in notebooks always fill the pages and don t start a fresh book until you ve filled all the pages reuse gift bags wrapping paper newspaper and tissue everybody loves a well wrapped gift but that doesn t mean you have to use brand new wrapping paper for every gift you give instead when you get a gift keep the bag or wrapping paper it came in so that you can use it again for another gift newspaper can also be repurposed as an eco friendly wrapping paper or tissue paper to stuff a gift bag 6 x research source turn old paper products into crafts there are plenty of crafts that require paper so instead of using fresh sheets why not reuse old paper that was already bound for the recycler you can use old newspapers notes cards and other paper to make things like 7 x research source origami wreaths paper flowers paper mâché dolls recycle paper you can t reuse when you do have paper that you can t reuse or repurpose make sure you recycle it instead of throwing it in the trash paper that goes in the garbage just ends up in a landfill but paper that goes into the recycling bin can be sent to a special facility and turned into something new,Home-and-Garden
how to build a swimming pool from wood and plastic,you will require a lot of 2 by 4 pieces of wood at least 8 as long as you want a side of the pool and a lot of other ones for the bracing at least 20 braces will be needed depending on height of pool,build braces for the side of the pool by placing two pieces of wood the length of the pool on the floor find out what height you want the pool and then cut wood to that length minus the width of the 2 by 4 screw the pieces into the wood at minimum 1 distances and maximum 2 distance repeat step 1 and 2 until you have 4 braces like this cut 4 pieces of plywood to the height and length of the braces attach them on the front side of the bracing now you need to build side bracing to hold the water in you can either design your own bracing or use this one build a box of 2 by 4 the height of the pool with another piece of 2 by 4 on the inside going diagonally try to make sure the wood on the inside goes from the top of the pool wall to the ground at the bottom of the base build at least 4 for each side and attach them to the 2 by 4 on the inside of wall bracing attach the walls together by either putting them together and screwing the sides in or you can use a block on the corners and connect them the first one is the simpler and easier one you just require long screws screw the pool walls into the floor from the braces and from the pool walls itself use many many many screws put the pool liner inside the pool walls you have connected and then screw 1 by 4 or 1 by 3 into the top of the pool walls to secure the plastic fill it with water finished,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a volcanic eruption,volcanic activity can result in explosions called plinian eruptions that shoot rocks ash and gas hundreds of feet into the air while not all types of volcanic eruptions are so dramatic they can all be terrifying fortunately most volcanoes are carefully monitored and scientists can usually provide some advance warning before a serious event but if you live near a volcano or get an opportunity to visit one you are always at risk and it s important to know how to prepare for an eruption and escape one alive,know your community s warning system if you live near a volcano your community likely has a plan in place to warn people that the volcano may erupt in many cases sirens and emergency alerts on televisions are used to alert people that danger is imminent local radio stations will also broadcast important advisories since each region is a little different it s important to know the specific warning procedures in your area 1 x research source as soon as you hear a siren turn on the radio to find out what the local emergency management agency advises you may be told to stay indoors keep away from certain areas or in extreme cases evacuate if you don t live in the area and you re just traveling through you should still be familiar with the region s warning system so you ll know what it means when you hear it get familiar with the evacuation procedures if you live near a well researched and well monitored volcano you can probably obtain a hazard zone map from your local emergency management agency or in the u s from the u s geological survey these maps show the probable paths of lava flows and lahar or mudflows and give estimates for the minimum time it would take a flow to reach a given location they also divide the area around the volcano into zones from high risk to low risk using this information you can get some idea of how safe your house or workplace is and you can plan the best route of escape because volcanic eruptions are complex and to some extent unpredictable you should have several alternative routes to reach one or more safe zones develop a household evacuation plan figure out what you ll need to do if you hear the sirens go off map out exactly where your family will go and figure out the safest way to get there keep in mind that if the sky is filled with ash you won t be able to travel far by car since ash interferes with mechanisms in car engines and prevents them from operating correctly talk with each of your family members about the evacuation plan make sure everyone knows exactly what to do and where to meet don t forget to include your pets in your evacuation plan it s a good idea to have a checklist you can run down so you make sure you don t forget anyone or anything in the heat of the moment include a list of the people and animals that should be present the possessions you ll take with you and fast actions you might take to seal up your house to prevent as much damage as possible stock up on necessities store at least a two weeks supply of food and portable water at your home in the event of an eruption water supplies may become contaminated so you can t count on your well or public water keep all your supplies in one place a large container that you can carry for example so that you can quickly bring them with you if you need to evacuate in addition to food and water stock up on the following a first aid kit blankets and warm clothing a battery powered radio and fresh batteries so that you will be able to listen to advisories if the power goes out necessary medications a map of the region be prepared when you re traveling near a volcano if you will be visiting a volcano knowledge is your most important protection before going to the volcano consult with local authorities and heed their recommendations or warnings learn about the hazards you may encounter in the area of the volcano and get a reputable guide to accompany you if possible if you re going to be climbing or hiking near the volcano you should bring a few survival items that will help you survive if you re caught outside without access to shelter you ll need a respirator and goggles to protect your face and help you breathe bring long pants and long sleeved shirts bring plenty of water in case you become unexpectedly trapped by a lava flow and don t overexert yourself you ll be able to react more quickly and run for your life if necessary if you re not fatigued listen for radio or tv advisories if you hear the sirens go off when a volcano erupts immediately tune in to determine if you are in immediate danger where you are and also to find out what is happening around you these advisories will be your eyes to see the larger picture and help you assess the situation and make the right decisions the sirens will most likely be your first warning that an eruption is occurring but you might receive other indications that something is amiss if you see a plume of debris rising from the volcano or if you feel an earthquake tune in immediately make sure your battery operated radio is in working order in case the power goes out it s an important way to stay connected and learn about updates that can affect your safety do not ignore emergency instructions in most cases you ll be told to stay inside but you may be ordered to evacuate it s extremely important to follow the advisories whatever they may be in order to ensure your family s safety most importantly if you re told to evacuate do it right away conversely if you are not instructed to evacuate the area stay where you are unless you can see immediate danger taking to the roads may be more hazardous than staying at home in recent eruptions many people have been killed because they did not heed an evacuation order if you are lucky enough to get advance warning use it wisely instead of trying to hold your ground it s also important to evacuate the area as soon as possible after being told to do so if you wait too long you ll have to deal with ash fall which will muck up your car s engine and make it more difficult to leave get inside if you re caught outdoors unless you need to evacuate the safest place you can be is inside a strong structure close all the windows and doors to protect yourself from ash and burning cinders 2 x research source make sure all of your family members are inside and that your emergency supply of food and water is indoors with you if you own livestock bring them inside their shelter and close the doors and windows if you have time protect machinery by putting it inside a garage get to high ground if you can t find shelter lava flows lahars mudflows and flooding are common in a major eruption all of these can be deadly and all of them tend to travel in valleys and low lying areas climb to higher ground and stay there until you can confirm that the danger has passed protect yourself from pyroclastics while you want to get to higher ground you should also try to shield yourself from pyroclastics which are rocks and debris sometimes red hot that are sent flying during an eruption the most important thing to do is watch out for them and get out of their range sometimes they actually rain down and in some types of eruptions such as that which occurred at mount st helens in 1980 they can land miles from the volcano s crater protect yourself by staying below the ridgelines of hills and on the side of the hill opposite the volcano if you are caught in a hail of smaller pyroclastics crouch down on the ground facing away from the volcano and protect your head with your arms a backpack or anything else you can find avoid exposure to poisonous gases volcanoes emit a number of gases and if you are close to one when it erupts these gases could be deadly breathe through a respirator mask or moist piece of cloth this will also protect your lungs from clouds of ash and try to get away from the volcano as quickly as possible do not stay low to the ground as some of the most dangerous gases are heavier than air and accumulate near the ground protect your eyes as well wear goggles if your mask doesn t cover your eyes keep your skin covered with long pants and a long sleeved shirt don t try to cross geothermal areas hot spots geysers and mudpots are common on volcanoes the ground around these is typically very thin and a fall through could result in serious burns or death never try to cross these during an eruption and otherwise cross them only on safe marked paths mudflows and flooding following an eruption generally kill far more people than pyroclastics or lava you can be in danger even many miles from the volcano never try to cross a lava flow or lahar even flows that appear to be cooled may simply have formed a thin crust over a core of extremely hot lava if you do cross a lava flow you run the risk of being trapped between flows if another suddenly develops remain indoors until you re told it s safe to come out keep the radio on and stay inside until you learn the danger has passed and you re free to go outside even after the eruption is over you might be advised to stay inside until the ash stops falling if you do go outside before it s deemed safe make sure your body is covered from head to toe and that you breathe through a respirator or moistened cloth drink only bottled water until the tap water is said to be clean if you see ash in any water source avoid drinking it 3 x research source if the ash falls for many hours officials might advise evacuating even after the eruption is over that s because ash is so heavy that it can cause roofs to collapse creating dangerous situations for people staying indoors stay away from areas with heavy ash fall volcanic ash is comprised of tiny glass like particles that are harmful to the lungs don t walk or drive in areas close to the volcano where a lot of ash has collected turn on the radio to find out which areas were most severely affected keeping away from ash especially important for people with respiratory conditions like asthma or bronchitis don t drive through areas with heavy ash fall either the ash will clog up your engine and ruin it 4 x research source clear ash from your home and property when you re sure it s safe to go out you ll need to clear the ash from your rooftop and other areas ash is very heavy and can cause roofs to collapse especially when it s wet if wind stirs it up it will be harmful to those who breathe it in 5 x research source wear long pants and a long sleeved shirt and cover your mouth with a mask to avoid breathing in the ash you might also want to wear goggles shovel the ash into trash bags then seal them and dispose of them according to your community s recommendations don t turn your air conditioner on or open your vents back up until most of the ash has been cleared away get medical care if necessary receive medical treatment promptly for burns injuries and gas or ash inhalation once you are safe waste no time getting treatment or an examination keep in mind however that you may need to wait a while if there are people with more serious injuries,Home-and-Garden
how to survive under martial law,martial law occurs when a military assumes the responsibility of governance the rights of citizens are usually limited during martial law and democratic processes are eliminated in favor of authoritarian power though it may not be easy there are ways to make the experience less brutal and survive until the conflict is resolved,prepare for the civil unrest pay attention to current events know when potential threats are coming to the area you may have no warning when another country invades yours 1 x research source however you may know if a hurricane or tornado is coming your way websites like www ready gov are devoted to disaster preparedness stock your home with supplies 2 x research source before martial law is enacted you may be on your own during a breakdown of civil authority be ready to survive at least 72 hours 3 x research source without help protect your home and business after civil authority has broken down people may become opportunistic homes and businesses may be looted 4 x research source secure your home and business in advance board up windows and barricade doors stay in your home with your own supplies until military help arrives recognize the legitimacy of martial law for whatever reason martial law has been declared and you are one of the citizens functioning under it if your country has been invaded i e your area is still under the protection of your country s military or a major natural disaster has occurred you should recognize that martial law might be best for moment the soldiers are there to maintain order and keep you safe until civilian authority can be re established 5 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source show respect and courtesy to authorities 6 x research source they are not perfect human beings and mistakes will happen the best thing you can do is assist and obey keep your head down and don t draw attention to yourself this isn t the time for political activism if you want to survive keep everything you can t live without on your person if you are being moved there may be no time to go back for your things have everything you need on you at all times in case you have to move immediately anything you might be tempted to go back for keep on you if there is some object too big to carry around you may have to leave it in rare situations you may be able to hide something special until you are able to come back for it you may want to consider burying a time capsule in a waterproof container to retrieve when you return follow all directives given to you no matter how odd or strange it is best to do as you are told if a curfew is set be in your quarters by then if you are given a meal time don t think you will be served if you show up late even if you are hungry if certain areas are off limits do not go exploring beyond the boundary your rights are greatly limited until civil order is re established so don t push your boundaries if you want to survive if you are under martial law in a country that you know intends to do you harm e g jewish germans 7 x research source or japanese americans 8 x research source during world war ii you may want to consider hiding from the government instead of being a good citizen you may want to learn military time 9 x research source some watches and phones can be adjusted to show military time automatically in general times are written out differently such that 9 00am nine o clock am becomes 0900 zero nine hundred and 3 30pm three thirty pm becomes 1530 fifteen thirty in other words pm times are 12 greater than normal and times are described as if they are four digit whole numbers without the colon with the hour always represented as two numbers don t drop leading zeros hours may be referred to in hundreds but never thousands obey orders as you are instructed 10 x research source orders are usually quick and fast and without explanation resisting or forcing an explanation may be dangerous military personnel may be given orders they don t even understand they expect you to follow orders just as they are doing time sensitive orders they may not have time to explain or their explanation may cause a panic trust that their goal is to protect you and any failure they would take personally help others as much as you are able the military personnel may be short staffed offer to help as much as you can you will garner their respect this way you may then learn more about what s going on and why things are happening as they are if you find out important information that you have permission to share spread the word make sure other people know what s going on and hopefully everyone will be able to survive the event establish a survival bunker in a hidden location 11 x research source this bunker should be able to keep you and your family safe for several years the best bunkers are usually underground many are underground but in the sides of mountains or hills the goals is to be able to get in and out but for no one else to be able to find you keep your bunker secret 12 x research source by never carrying your phone or gps enabled device with you when you visit even when you turn your gps off you may still be tracked with cell phone tower signals don t discuss your plans with anyone outside your family and resist the temptation to show off on social media stock your survival bunker with supplies 13 x research source everything you would need for several years worth of living this will include food water and medicine you can consult a survival guide or book to determine the best setup think about everything you and your family uses frequently over the course of a year and make sure you have everything you absolutely need some items such as medicines may be difficult to acquire by legitimate means proper storage may also be difficult favor solid form pills over liquids as their shelf life tends to be longer even after the expiration date 14 x research source store medicine in a cool dry place to extend potency and remember that taking drugs after their expiration date is rarely harmful get to your survival bunker as quickly as possible if you are going to stay ahead of the military you will need to move fast as soon as martial law is declared you may not have time to discuss what to do next you may think the military isn t there yet but local law enforcement may start implementing martial law beforehand have everything you want or need in your survival bunker and move there as soon as humanly possible keep a radio on hand to keep track of when martial law has ended most likely you will not be able to stay in your bunker forever you will need to keep contact with the outside world 15 x research source you need to know when it will be safe to emerge since batteries degrade you may want to use a survival radio that incorporates a hand crank for power 16 x research source be cautious of pro military propaganda know what frequencies local militias are broadcasting on and any code words don t listen to just anything but wait until the militias give you the ok that civil authority has been restored stay in your bunker until you are sure it is safe to leave the hardest part of hiding is the isolation however each time you step out of the bunker may risk the fate of your whole family someone may see you entering or exiting your bunker you may accidentally leave tracks or human scent near the entrance search dogs may then be able to find you stay in your bunker as long as you possibly can before emerging if you are in your bunker for a long time prioritize your food based on expiration date eat whatever might expire soon first have a go bag ready for the day martial law is declared 17 x research source if you think martial law is going to be enacted by any military force hostile to you then you should consider being ready will you have a better chance resisting or submitting have a go bag with all the supplies you need to make it from where you are to where you are supposed to be your go bag should be light but fully stocked estimate how far you may ever be from your bunker to determine what you need for your bag you should favor small and light items as you may be carrying the bag this includes basic survival gear and food in case you have to walk or hike to your bunker 18 x research source stash guns ammo supplies and survival gear in a hidden bunker 19 x research source this will be your family s rally point when martial law happens be sure to include everything you will need to wait out the storm your bunker should be equipped such that once you go in you won t need to leave for supplies for months if you have valuables you don t want to leave behind go ahead and store them in your bunker in advance you may not have time to go home to pack before the military rolls into town stocking your bunker with supplies can be difficult and cost prohibitive start with a 72 hour setup for natural disaster preparedness 20 x research source then move toward a two week day bomb shelter once you get the hang of it increase to however long you think you ll need know the rally point established by the local militia most likely you are not the only person or family to see what s coming other people are likely getting ready for the military to take over become part of your local militia and find out what your plans are to resist a malevolent military you may need to be quick in attacking local supply depots and establishing an effective resistance group up with your militia as soon as humanly possible once you have your own home base established with your family protected be ready to move militias survive as long as there are enough people to protect strategic locations your militia will need all the manpower they can get take a few supplies and rations but leave most of it in your bunker your militia should have their own hidden stockpiles 21 x research source of supplies if they will ever be successful be careful not to reveal your home base or inventory of supplies to your militia if the militia crumbles you need a safe place to fall back to if your militia is in danger they may see your home base as a supply depot leaving you and your family in jeopardy establish a chain of command and follow orders 22 x research source until now a military chain of command may have been hypothetical or loosely enforced now its time to follow orders without question establish the leadership structure and who you must report to and who reports to you most likely there will be people in your ranks with prior military experience their expertise will be crucial to maintaining order stay with your militia as you move to a safe location if you survive and fight long enough you may need to move to another safe location this may be a retreat or you may be grouping up with other local militias to form a larger resistance force you may be moving to re establish civil authority regardless if the supplies of your bunker are running out your options are limited you will likely not be alone in this respect you will need to move with the militia to a safe location to continue resisting the government long term,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare used cooking oil for biodiesel,biodiesel is a combustible fuel that is biodegradable and made from vegetable oil or animal fat it is desirable as an alternative to petroleum fuel because it uses renewable resources that are less damaging to the environment to produce and emit less harmful greenhouse gasses when burned as fuel biodiesel fuel can be used in any vehicle with a compression ignition engine that can take regular diesel fuel with the proper equipment and safety procedures you can prepare used cooking oil from your kitchen or a restaurant to make your own biodiesel fuel,obtain used cooking oil locate a source for vegetable oil that has been used in cooking contact local fast food restaurants cafeterias hotels and other commercial food establishments to see if you can take their waste oil or pay a very small fee for it you may compete with rendering companies who also pay restaurants to take used oil off their hands 1 x research source try a restaurant that sells a lot of fried food like french fries or fried chicken as they are very likely to have large quantities of used oil that they need to dispose of ask restaurants if they use canola or olive oil as these are typically the best oils for creating biodiesel avoid hydrogenated oils which are generally higher in free fatty acids and cause problems in biodiesel production 2 x research source you can buy new cooking oil from the grocery store but using waste oil is less expensive and helps reduce waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill or in sewer pipes 3 x research source examine the oil look at the oil you obtain to roughly determine its quality it should look darker than fresh or unused vegetable oil and will likely include small food matter left from the frying process if the oil appears milky or cloudy do not use it as it is likely too high in water content and or animal fats which will interfere in the biodiesel production process make sure to follow the proper procedures to dispose of cooking oil that you do not use contact your local waste management company or ask the restaurant you obtained the oil from to find out how they safely dispose of the oil pour your oil into clear plastic containers take any transparent plastic jug from juice soda or any other household product and pour your used oil into it for storage ensure that any storage jug is completely clean dry and free of any other residue or materials including water use a container with a tight lid and no cracks or leaks the oil may already have come to you in an acceptable container when you obtained it from a restaurant or other source however you will need several clean containers at least 3 on hand for storing oil at each stage of the filtration process label oil containers and all other materials used in biodiesel production clearly at this stage you can label the oil as used oil or unfiltered oil in order to avoid confusion in later steps of the process heat the oil to 95ºf pour your used oil into a large clean cooking pot and heat it to 95ºf over an electric burner to make the oil easier to pour for filtration use a cooking thermometer to monitor the temperature don t use a gas burner for this or any other stage of the biodiesel creation process 4 x research source it s best to complete this process outdoors or in a very well ventilated area wear long rubber gloves an apron and safety goggles to protect against any splashing or spillage try heating slightly more than one liter of oil to produce a liter of prepared oil as some volume is lost during filtering use cheesecloth or a coffee filter to pour oil through place a piece of cheesecloth or a coffee filter into a funnel place the funnel on top of another clean plastic container labeled screened oil or something similar carefully pour the heated oil through this prepared funnel and into the container to catch large food particles 5 x research source for a larger amount of oil you can use a screen placed over a large clean bucket use a screen intended for paint or windows and pour the used oil through it and into the clean bucket discard the cheesecloth coffee filter or screen with the particles that were caught or rinse thoroughly for future use if applicable reheat the oil to 140ºf pour your screened oil back into the cooking pot after washing out the pot thoroughly return it to the electric burner and heat at a consistent 140ºf for 15 minutes to allow any water to separate from the oil 6 x research source monitor the temperature closely with a cooking thermometer the heat should not reach above 140ºf as you will run the risk of steam explosions from the water that settles at the bottom pour the reheated oil into a container to settle after it has cooled return the oil to a plastic container either the one you used last or a new clean container labeled settling oil or something similar let the oil sit for at least 24 hours to allow the water to further settle to the bottom of the container observe the container after 24 hours the water should have settled into a defined layer at the bottom of the container and it will be cloudy and light tan in color not clear 7 x research source transfer the oil to a clean container after settling is complete pour the oil slowly into a new clean container labeled filtered oil or something similar taking care not to pour the settled water in with the oil water can negatively affect the quality of your biodiesel fuel the less water content in the oil the easier the next steps of the biodiesel process will be dissolve lye into distilled water in a glass container add a gram of lye to one liter of distilled water this is a 0 1 lye solution used as a testing device for the ph level of your oil 8 x research source use extreme care when handling lye as it is a toxic substance wear eye protection and rubber gloves at all times handle in a well ventilated space and be sure to label your lye and 0 1 lye solution clearly if lye gets onto your skin neutralize it immediately with vinegar and rinse with cool water you can obtain lye as a household drain cleaning product but you must ensure that it is 100 lye with no other ingredients added if you order from a chemical supplier you can use sodium hydroxide naoh or potassium hydroxide koh 9 x research source use the same ratio of lye to distilled water if you want to make a larger or smaller quantity of test solution you can store this solution with a tight lid for testing of future oil batches add oil to isopropyl alcohol in a separate glass container pour 1 ml of your filtered oil and 10 ml of isopropyl rubbing alcohol warm the mixture gently by placing the container into hot water then stir until the mixture is clear wooden chopsticks work well to stir the oil and alcohol 10 x research source add phenolphthalein solution get phenolphthalein solution from a chemical supplier to use as a ph indicator as it visibly turns from clear to pink at a ph level of 8 5 which is the level you want for creating biodiesel add two drops of phenolphthalein to your oil and alcohol mixture you can use a ph meter ph test strips or a natural food based ph indicator like red cabbage juice instead but you may not get as easy to read or accurate indications as with phenolphthalein 11 x research source you will use this indicator to determine the right level of lye to add to your oil to create an ideal ph level add 0 1 lye solution to your oil and alcohol mixture slowly drip your lye solution into the container with oil alcohol and phenolphthalein stir continuously stop adding the lye solution when your mixture achieves a pink or magenta color and holds that color for 15 seconds indicating the correct ph level 12 x research source add your lye solution using a graduated syringe or pipette so that you can note exactly how much lye is used the number of milliliters used to turn the mixture pink for 15 seconds is the same number of grams you ll need to add to the basic quantity of lye used for the biodiesel process 13 x research source aim for a quality of oil that needs 2 5 3 5 ml of lye to turn the mixture pink you may need to try oil from a number of different sources to find this quality which is ideal for beginners discard oil that requires a very high quantity of lye and try again with oil from a different source 14 x research source ready your main quantity of oil after you ve determined the acidity of your oil you can complete the rest of the chemical reaction to create biodiesel using your filtered oil lye and methanol follow reliable and safe instructions to complete the rest of the biodiesel process note that you will add the results of your titration test the number of milliliters of lye needed to turn your mixture pink to the quantity of lye your biodiesel instructions call for 15 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to be safe when home alone kids,you get to stay home alone you re probably excited but you also might be a little nervous that s perfectly normal you re being faced with new responsibilities don t worry though you can take steps to prevent danger while you re at home as well as learn what to do if an emergency does happen,follow your parents rules your parents want you to stay safe that s why they have rules if you re not sure what the rules are sit down with your parents and write out a list together so you both have something to refer to 1 x research source the rules might cover who you can have over if anyone whether you can go outside and whether you can take phone calls lock the doors and windows while break ins are unusual they can happen the best thing you can do is keep the doors and windows locked when you re inside that way someone can t just walk in without your permission 2 x research source if your family has an alarm learn how to set it so it can protect you while you re home set the alarm to stay preferably instant so that police are notified in the event of a break in avoid opening the door to people you don t know if someone comes to the door it s best to ignore it if you don t know the person if the person is delivering a package ask them to leave it or come back later don t tell them you re by yourself 3 x research source it s also important not to tell people over the phone that you re by yourself at home if someone calls for your parents you can say they can t come to the phone right now can i have them call you back stay away from dangerous items in the house even though you re home alone you don t have free rein to do anything you want you still need to stay away from dangerous things don t play with matches knives or guns for instance also don t take medications unless you know what you re doing don t mix chemicals and cleaners you find around the house as it can create fumes or liquids that can hurt you 4 x research source call your parents if you need to if something happens or you don t know what to do call your parents or another trusted adult they can walk you through the situation so you feel safe again it s best to know your parents cell phone numbers by heart so you ll always be able to call even if you can t see the list of emergency numbers have emergency numbers ready if something happens you need to be ready the main emergency number you need to know is 9 1 1 in the united states they can help with emergencies like fires someone breaking in or injuries but you should only call them when it s truly an emergency if you get a small cut that s not a reason to call 9 1 1 5 x research source keep other emergency numbers on hand such as your parents numbers as well as other people you can call if you have an issue such as a neighbor or family member if you don t have these numbers handy ask your parents to make a list and post it up for you to see easily 6 x research source practice what to say during an emergency call when you call 9 1 1 the operator will want to know a few things they ll want to know where you are your address and what s wrong they ll also want to know your phone number so they can call back if needed try running through a practice call with your parents 7 x research source run through practice emergencies with your parents if something crazy happens you may want to panic most people do it s important to stay calm though one way you can learn to stay calm is to go over what to do when things happen with your parents ahead of time 8 x research source things can go wrong in a house such as a toilet overflowing the smoke alarm going off or something catching on fire in the kitchen ask your parents to go over potential problems with you learn where the emergency exits are you need to be able to know how to get out of your house in different ways of course the back and front doors are good options if there s a fire though you may need to escape through a window to get to safety 9 x research source ask your parents to go over the best ways out of the house learn the basics of first aid if you re at home alone you need to know how to deal with getting a cut or a burn if you have a bad cut or burn you can call 9 1 1 but if you re only a little hurt you can fix it yourself 10 x research source for instance for a cut wash your hands then hold a clean cloth against it to stop the bleeding rinse out the cut with cool water use antibiotic ointment and then put a band aid over it 11 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source for a bruise prop the area up on a pillow apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to help ease the swelling don t keep ice on it for more than 10 minutes 12 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source with a light burn put it in cool running water for about 10 minutes don t use ice when it feels a little better you can use aloe vera gel on it 13 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source ask your parents where your first aid kit is if your home doesn t have one yet buy one or put one together with your parents don t go in your house if you see a broken window or open door if you come home and you see something not right don t go in the house a broken window could mean someone is inside it s better to stay safe go to a neighbor or friend s house and call 9 1 1 you can even go back to school if you need to 14 x research source don t let people you know in if it doesn t feel right even if you know an adult who s knocking on the door you don t have to let them in if it doesn t feel right sometimes even adults you know may not have good intentions trust your gut and call your parents if you re not sure some families have code words so if your parents send someone to help that you don t know you ll know it s okay then you can ask for the code word if someone says your parents sent them check out strange noises of course many houses make odd noises from time to time usually because the house is settling however if you hear a noise that s out of the ordinary you should check it out if you notice signs of trouble take action for instance if you notice signs of someone breaking in get out of the house if you can and run to a neighbor s for safety pay attention to warning signs your home is likely equipped with both smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors when these go off don t ignore them if you don t know what to do it s best to get out of the house and dial 9 1 1 at a neighbor s house 15 x research source if you notice that something is smoking it s likely time to call 9 1 1 so the fire department can help you you can try to work a fire extinguisher if your parents have shown you how to use one however if the fire is more than a very small one get out of the house also if your house has a gas stove or heater always pay attention to gas smells the carbon monoxide detector should warn you but it s always best to get out of the house if you smell gas natural gas has an additive to make it smell like rotten eggs,Home-and-Garden
how to build a generator,our society has become accustomed to using equipment and appliances that run on ac power provided by our local power provider in most cases this is ideal but in some cases ac power is not available ac power may be unavailable because the distribution grid of the power provider is not operating or because no distribution grid exists in the area as would be the case on camping or hiking excursions ac power can be made available in areas that cannot get ac power from a distribution grid by using a gasoline powered generator to make ac power gasoline powered generators also may be used to recharge the 12 volt dc batteries of portable equipment the 12 volt dc batteries allow equipment and appliances to be used in the absence of a power grid but have limited run time available use these tips to learn how to build a generator,acquire an engine the required engine size is dependent on the amount of power that the generator will need to supply a good rule of thumb for a useful compact generator is to choose an engine in the range of 5 to 10 horsepower note that most engines rate their horsepower at a speed of 3 600 rotations per minute rpm these motors are about the size of lawn mower engines and are typically available at lawn equipment stores industrial supply shops or power equipment outlets 1 x research source choose an ac generator head this head will use an internal magnet to create electricity when the shaft mounted magnet is spun by the external engine for most applications output levels of 2 500 to 5 000 watts is suitable in sizing the head use the specification of the manufacturer to determine the engine size needed to drive that head as a rough estimate a generator can produce about 900 749 watts per horsepower is the actual conversion watts per input horsepower heads are available through industrial supply outlets and industrial equipment catalogs select a 12 volt dc alternator this alternator will generate 12 volts dc when the shaft is driven by the external engine the alternator chosen must have a built in voltage regulator a 500 watt alternator is typically sufficient and would require about another horsepower from the chosen engine alternators are widely available at auto parts suppliers 2 x research source fabricate a mounting plate 3 x research source this mounting plate can be made of any sturdy material that can withstand the vibration of the gasoline engine the 3 main power pieces engine generator head and alternator must be mounted so that their shafts are parallel and the shaft attachment areas for drive pulleys are in the same plane mounting holes and mounting hole patterns must be derived from the manufacturer data for each of the 3 major power pieces mount the pulleys a pulley must be mounted to the engine shaft to belt drive the pulleys that will come already installed on the generator head and the alternator this pulley size must be chosen so that when the engine is rotating at the nominal running speed given by the manufacturer the belts will scale this up or down to the pulleys of the generator head and the alternator choose the scaling so that the generator head and the alternator are running at the rated speed indicated on the manufacturer data sheet in most typical generators this will result in an engine pulley of 5 to 10 inches 125 to 250 mm pulleys are available at industrial supply stores and through equipment supplier catalogs run the belt or belts the design of the generator may need different pulleys on the engine to apply proper shaft speed to the generator head and the alternator or this may be workable with 1 engine pulley and 1 belt run the belt over the pulleys and make sure that they are taught slotting the mounting holes of the engine will provide good adjustment to achieve this a v belt is preferable to a standard belt as it will have less tendency to slip belts may be acquired from the outlet that supplied the pulleys mount the gasoline tank to the mounting plate reconnect the gasoline supply fill the gasoline tank and place the fuel feed lines to the engine,Home-and-Garden
how to be safe during a landslide,landslides occur when large amounts of wet debris including rocks earth and trees slide down a slope they may occur as a result of fires earthquakes volcanic eruptions storms or human activity landslides are particularly dangerous because they strike suddenly move at extremely high speeds and travel long distances 1 x research source although landslides are often difficult to predict you can prepare for a landslide by following proper safety protocol familiarizing yourself with the warning signs and making an emergency plan,keep yourself alert and awake landslides can occur quite suddenly so you need to be ready to take action at a moment s notice many landslide related deaths occur while people are asleep 2 x research source if you are with other people work together to keep one another awake watch and listen for warning signs of a nearby landslide including sounds of falling debris or changes in water clarity or flow it is imperative that you familiarize yourself with landslide warning signs especially if you live in an at risk area keep reading to learn more about landslide warning signs in detail listen to a local news station for updates using a battery powered radio or television listen to your local news station for updates about the weather be alert to warnings about intense rainfall which can trigger landslides 3 x research source evacuate if it is safe to do so sometimes your local law enforcement will order an evacuation but other times they may not be aware of a landslide until it is too late if you think a landslide is imminent and it is safe to leave evacuate immediately contact your neighbors and your local police or fire department to warn them of danger 4 x research source be sure to bring your animals with you don t forget to bring your emergency kit which contains essential items like food water and medication you ll learn how to make one in a later section be cautious and alert while driving if you need to drive to leave a dangerous area proceed with caution beware of flooded roads collapsed pavement fallen debris and washed out bridges do not cross flooded streams instead turn around and try to find an alternative route 5 x research source move to a second story if possible if it isn t safe to leave the building but you believe a landslide is imminent move to the building s second story if possible 6 x research source move out of the path of the landslide as quickly as you can landslides move very quickly much faster than you can run or walk trying to outrun a landslide is futile instead remove yourself as fast as you can from the path of the landslide 7 x research source before crossing any bridges always look upstream to see if a landslide is approaching if this is the case do not cross the bridge and move out of the path of the landslide avoid river valleys and other low areas these areas are especially dangerous when landslides are imminent so stay away 8 x research source curl into a ball if you cannot escape in some cases you may not be able to escape if you are trapped in the path of a landslide curl up into a tight ball and protect your head 9 x research source go to a public shelter your local community should have a designated public shelter go to the shelter if your home is unsafe or the authorities have called for an evacuation 10 x research source to find the shelter closest to you text shelter your zip code to 43362 4fema for example if your zip code is 56789 you would text shelter 56789 avoid the area where the landslide occurred landslides may recur in the same location avoid this area and seek shelter 11 x research source check for trapped and injured people you should not enter the area where the landslide occurred however if you can see people who are trapped or injured in the area notify the authorities immediately 12 x research source help neighbors who need special assistance infants the disabled and the elderly may experience extra difficulty in emergency situations if it is safe to do so help your neighbors with special needs remember that neighbors with large families may require additional assistance as well 13 x research source assess the area for damage and safety report any damaged utility lines roadways and railways to the authorities if you are in a building examine its foundation chimney and surrounding land to determine if the structure is stable if the area appears unsafe leave immediately 14 x research source replant the affected area landslides often destroy vegetation without vegetation the area is more susceptible to erosion and flash flooding which can lead to another landslide replanting the affected area helps prevent future landslides 15 x research source talk to a geotechnical expert if your property was damaged in the landslide consider talking to a geotechnical expert to reduce landslide risk the expert can evaluate your property and determine what modifications if any should be made to ensure your safety 16 x research source look for new areas of moisture if you see springs or puddles in areas of the ground that are usually dry this could be a sign of an imminent landslide 17 x research source look for warping in your home take note if your deck patio or concrete floors are tilting pulling away from the building or cracking sticking doors and windows could also indicate warping that precedes a landslide 18 x research source broken water lines or other utilities may also be a warning sign look for warping and movement in the surrounding area sunken roadbeds and leaning fences telephone poles and trees can signal an imminent landslide 19 x research source notice unusual sounds a faint rumbling sound that gets louder and louder could indicate an approaching landslide sounds like cracking trees or scraping rocks may signal moving debris from a landslide 20 x research source monitor changing water levels a sudden increase in creek water levels is a warning sign as is a sudden decrease in water levels despite recent rain 21 x research source if you live near a waterway check the water s clarity a change from clear to muddy could mean a landslide is imminent follow proper land use procedures proper land use procedures dictate that you should not build near mountain edges steep slopes or natural erosion valleys these areas are prone to landslides 22 x research source contact local officials about past landslides landslides tend to happen in the same area where they have occurred before talk to local officials about landslides in your area if you are in an at risk area consider getting a site analysis of your property this will help you determine any necessary corrective measures 23 x research source you should be especially attuned to landslide warning signs if you live in an at risk area consider building retaining or deflection walls retaining walls channels and deflection walls can shield your property from landslide debris and divert debris flow if you live in an area that is vulnerable to landslides consult a professional to see what should be done 24 x research source beware if your channels or deflection walls cause debris to flow into a neighbor s property you may have to pay for damages talk to an insurance agent if your area is at risk if your area is vulnerable to landslides talk to an insurance agent to see if your insurance covers landslide related damage although landslide insurance is not usually available some flood insurance policies cover damage from landslide flows 25 x research source make an emergency kit an emergency kit contains the essentials that your household will need during an emergency make your kit in advance so it is ready at a moment s notice your kit should contain enough food and water to last for at least 72 hours as well as supplies like medications flashlights batteries cell phones copies of personal documents and cash 26 x research source remember that landslides can cut off services like electricity sewage treatment gas water and telephones pack supplies in your kit that will allow you to deal with these outages choose food that is non perishable and can be prepared during power outages pack any important items that would be difficult or impossible to replace discuss safety protocol in the event of a landslide talk to your family about the appropriate actions to take in order to stay safe during a landslide especially if you live in a vulnerable area be sure to discuss evacuation procedures as well as safe locations and areas to avoid 27 x research source understand how to get emergency alerts make sure everyone knows how to get emergency alerts from local officials whether it be via phone television or radio talk to

how to rehab a property in the proper order,when buying property for rehabilitation it is important to do your house clean up and repairs in a particular order you don t want to get ahead of yourself or waste time and money on the project approach the process systematically and don t get frustrated if things don t go according to plan here are some pointers to help you rehabilitate a house or commercial property,inspect the property before you begin to rehab thoroughly inspect the property note which items are in good condition and which areas need work it s helpful to have a professional inspector walk through with you he or she will be able to identify things that you may miss in the u s you can find a qualified inspector through the american society of home inspectors 1 x research source ask the inspector questions as you go through the property the home inspection should include the heating system air conditioning or hvac system interior plumbing electrical system the roof the attic any visible insulation walls ceilings flooring windows doors foundation sewer line and the basement 2 x research source if you are not a contractor you should not conduct the inspection alone take pictures of everything during the inspection your inspector will typically take photos of problem areas for their records but you should have documentation for your purposes as well the cost of an inspection depends on the size of the property 3 x research source develop a checklist once you identify areas that need work create a rehab checklist this will help you stay on track and not miss any repairs include both interior walls paint etc and exterior items e g landscaping gutters and outside lighting 4 x research source the checklist should be very detailed and describe everything that needs to be done to the property 5 x research source the inspection report can be used to generate the checklist create a budget go through your checklist and decide how much each repair will cost an excel spreadsheet is a great tool to use for your budget the budget should be itemized for each individual repair if the cost of your repairs exceeds your budget you will need to make some changes to the checklist 6 x research source budget for unanticipated problems these are bound to happen new issues may arise once you begin the rehab process if you plan to sell the property once rehabbing is finished consider how much you will be able to sell the property for 7 x research source work with a contractor having a good contractor will make the rehab process much easier take your time when you are searching for a suitable contractor contractors can be found through referrals your local building department real estate investment associations and general job boards pre screen any candidate to determine if he or she is a good fit for your project 8 x research source pre screen questions should cover these considerations a contractor s experience you want at least three years equipment a contractor should have his her own equipment employees you want to see adequate support to complete the job licensing a contractor should be licensed by state or other local jurisdiction 9 x research source insurance liability and worker s compensation subcontractor use determine whether the contractor will be using subcontractors for the job referrals look for at least three positive referrals 10 x research source each contractor you re interested in should submit a formal bid choose the contractor who fits your budget and demonstrates the ability to do a good job have a walk through with the contractor once you have chosen a contractor you may need to do another walk through of the property your contractor can also help you make adjustments to your budget and checklist 11 x research source set a timeline for completion once you have everything in place with the contractor this will keep all involved parties accountable and on the same page get any necessary permits permits are typically required for rehabbing a property having the required permits in place will help you avoid violation of local building codes contact your local building department to determine what you need this will vary based on the type of work you ll be doing 12 x research source typical renovations that require a permit include installing new electrical wiring expanding floor space installing a fence over six feet tall and anything that involves a public sewer line tasks such as installing a roof putting in new flooring painting and replacing windows and doors usually will not require a permit your contractor can help you procure permits begin with demolition and trash removal remove any trash inside or outside the building remove any items that are damaged or that you will be replacing flooring cabinets appliances light fixtures toilets water heaters etc outside work may include trimming any dead trees or bushes and removing garage doors fencing sheds decks and siding address any roofing or foundation issues if the property needs new roofing this should be done before you begin working on any of the interior repairs you do not want any water leaking into the structure slab or block and beam foundation repairs must be made at this time as well fixing exterior issues first will draw less attention to the property while it is being rehabbed 13 x research source install new doors windows and trim exterior doors and windows should be addressed once the foundation is finished this will protect your property from weather and the intrusion of animals new windows and doors will also make the property look less like a construction site count the number of doors and windows you will need and take measurements before you purchase the items measure very carefully new entry doors are a nice way to change the look of a property and add value 14 x research source work on the plumbing and the heating ventilating and air conditioning system hvac plumbing repairs may include water heaters tubs and showers toilets and water gas lines you may need a new hvac system or repairs to the existing one the electrical system can be worked on during this time as well 15 x research source be careful if installing an outdoor air conditioning unit before someone is occupying the property full time you do not want it to get stolen hang and finish the sheet rock plasterboard you can either install new sheet rock or repair the existing sheet rock it is cheaper to repair existing sheet rock once you are finished with the sheet rock you can work on the wall and ceiling texture 16 x research source paint the ceiling and walls protect the floor with plastic or canvas and use painter s masking tape to protect the areas you don t want painted 17 x research source windows and hinges should be covered with tape as well 18 x research source chalk or apply spackling to the trim and baseboards before you start painting use a primer on the walls before applying the paint walls should be cleaned before you start painting some painters lightly sand and clean a wall again after the primer is applied paint the walls using a v or w shaped stroke and avoid using a straight up and down motion 19 x research source install light fixtures flooring and appliances stoves dishwashers washing machines dryers etc lighting is a great way to change the look of a property and is relatively inexpensive compared to other repairs flooring may include vinyl or ceramic tile hardwood carpet or laminate 20 x research source the flooring is installed later in the rehab process to avoid getting paint on the floor and to avoid damage from workers going in and out of the house because you want your floors to look fresh when you re finished you might consider doing the bulk of the interior work before installing flooring at the very least try to protect new flooring from heavy foot traffic during the inside work add the finishing touches once everything is done go through and examine all of the work that has been done you may need to touch up paint or do some last minute adjustments to the plumbing hvac or electrical systems you should also thoroughly clean the property a final inspection is a good idea as well landscape the property begin working at the front because this is what people will see first fences patios decks sidewalks porches and driveways should be taken care of first once those items are finished add soil for planting flowers bushes etc the back yard should be addressed last 21 x research source determine how much sun your property gets before you buy plants if there are many trees present get plants that do not require a lot of sunlight speak to someone at a garden center about your ideas and ask for suggestions about the type of plants that will work best for your property consider how much time your landscaping will require if you do not have a lot of time to devote to the yard look for low maintenance options if your windows are low plant low growing shrubs trees and ground cover instead of taller plants you do not want to obscure the view,Home-and-Garden
how to close in an unwanted in ground pool,filling an in ground swimming pool can lead to all sorts of unexpected problems once the pool is empty it may become buoyant while sitting in the ground if the soil conditions are right the pool can actually begin to float up out of the ground which can cause soil erosion or even foundation problems for a nearby house here is an inexpensive and easy method to rid yourself of an unwanted in ground swimming pool,drain the pool 1 x research source do this when the soil is dry so it will be unlikely for the pool to float out of the ground if the water contains chlorine or other harmful chemicals make sure it s not going into storm drains or other places it could cause environmental damage use a jackhammer sledgehammer or other tool to smash holes into the bottom of the pool this will allow water to drain out of it in the future remove any top decking concrete walkways coping tiles and any other concrete around the pool that you don t want anymore toss it into the pool over the holes you have made cover the old cement with a layer of crushed rock then cover this with a layer of sand or just fill it up the rest of the way with dirt if possible tamp it down as you go so you will have less settling over time be sure that the last foot of dirt is quality topsoil if you want to plant anything on top of it,Home-and-Garden
how to level an existing house,foundations settle over time even brand new houses experience some movement of the foundation the question is how do you level a floor that sinks toward the center of a home and how much of this can homeowners do of course this probably isn t something you should attempt on your own with zero experience however having an idea of what goes on can help you make the best decisions for yourself and for you home,consult a qualified structural engineer first the structure may not be as you expect and you may cause more problems than you solve 1 x research source determine how far the middle of the house needs to be lifted with a taut string water or laser level make a straight line from one side of the foundation to the other you may find this task easier if you hold the string off the sagging floor joists by attaching blocks of the same thickness at opposite sides of the basement nail them to the underside of the joists as near the foundation as you can measure the distance from that line to the bottom of the floor joists repeat this process in several locations under the house 2 x research source when you know where the lowest portion of the center is located mark that location 3 x research source build a temporary post using concrete blocks or large blocks of wood make sure that the post is located on firm level ground under the house alternate the placement of each layer of blocks by 90 degrees to improve stability 4 x research source buy or rent a hydraulic jack when the space above the temporary post is adequate to place the jack and reach the structural member above start jacking the house up as the house moves add smaller blocks to support the center of the structure at the new elevation 5 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source when the lowest point has been raised to the height of the next lowest points remove the jack carefully allowing the house to rest on the temporary post 6 x research source check for problems that may have been created by movement of the house see warnings below sheetrock cracks may appear build another temporary post and repeat the process when the floor is level and stable on the temporary posts it is time to prepare for permanent supports existing supports may be usable with minor modifications check the bottom of the supports for rot or other signs of trouble if the bottom of the posts are no longer sinking they can remain in place by cutting the center supports shorter a new beam can be placed on top of the shortened posts to support the center of the house 7 x research source,Home-and-Garden

applications in order to get your air supply right you ll want to arm yourself with the right knowledge here s how to do just that,analyze the requirements of the equipment that you will be powering are you going to be using the compressor to power machinery or to power pneumatic tools or to simply inflate a tire you ll probably want a compressor with a tank if you plan on using tools that require high flow you may want a portable compressor without a tank if you plan on merely using it for air brushing or filling a tire since there is no tank to store the compressed air the tankless type will run continuously which usually isn t an issue since they are usually quite small and therefore make minimal noise in particular consider pressure and volume requirements of any tools you may be using obviously heavy duty tools require much more pressure and in turn more volume if you fail to choose a compressor that s large enough for your intended use you will find yourself periodically waiting for the tank to fill up thereby decreasing your work efficiency if the portable air compressor is for airbrushing for example 5 liter 1 3 us gal a small tank capacity and around 30 psi of sustained air pressure would be adequate understand the types of compressor available 1 x research source essentially there are two different kinds of air compressors reciprocating and rotary screw the most common type you ll likely see for sale somewhere is the reciprocating piston type it has a cylinder with a piston that moves up and down and a one way valve on top of the moving piston some air compressors utilize a dual piston setup for higher flow and or pressure the other type of air compressor is the rotary screw these are designed for continuous use and are often used with tools that run for several seconds or minutes at a time such as impact wrenches and jackhammers and in industrial applications piston compressors come in single stage and two stage single stage tops out at about 150 psi 2 x research source two stage compressors use two pistons usually of different size to deliver around 200 psi the larger piston compresses air to about 100 psi and the second piston compresses that air to near 200 psi be aware that a single stage compressor may have two pistons but it is still considered a single stage because the second piston will be the same size and only maxes out around 150 psi the benefit of this design is that it compresses air quicker than a single piston compressor just because an air compressor has dual pistons doesn t mean it s a two stage compressor 3 x research source single stage compressors are adequate for powering most pneumatic tools caulk guns spray guns glue guns and of course as well as for inflating tires and rafts dual piston whether single or two stage compressors are more often used when owners expect higher usage 4 x research source look at the horsepower hp of the air compressor a common range for horsepower on an air compressor is between 1 5 and 6 5 hp air compressors with larger hp capacity exist but are usually reserved for industrial uses and offer far greater psi there are many blogs and articles online indicating horsepower ratings have changed in recent years it is probably best to look at the flow rates instead of hp ratings if you are comparing today s models to much older ones 5 x research source small scale uses won t require as much horsepower as industrial uses while horsepower is a valuable marker in determining your air compressor it shouldn t be the only one more valuable will be a cfm rating or cubic feet per minute if you can find one read more below for a detailed discussion of cfm try to look at cubic feet per minute cfm cfm is a measure of volumetric flow easy enough right the difficult part is that cfm changes depending on the psi of the compressor meaning that two tools with different psi won t necessarily have cfms that you can simply add together which is what you want to be able to do this is where things get tricky let s try to keep it simple 6 x research source look for or ask about standard cfm scfm when evaluating compressors standard cfm is measured as 14 5 psia at 68 f 20 c with 0 relative humidity 7 x research source if you choose not to use scfm be sure to use cfm numbers that are all pegged at the same psi when you ve got the scfm of all your air tools that you ll be using simultaneously add up their scfms then add 30 to that as a safety buffer this should give you the maximum required cfm usage you ll need to complete the job when choosing an air compressor you want to get close to this number so that you don t waste time with a too small unit or waste money on a too large one say for example that you re using a grease gun 4 cfm 90 psi framing nailer 2 cfm 90 psi and dual sander 11 cfm 90 psi at approximately the same time add all the cfms to get 17 cfm 90 psi as your max required cfm consider space and portability 8 x research source for example will you be able to roll the compressor or lift it off the ground if you need to air compressors can be small portable items or larger more powerful fixtures portability is convenient but if it will stay in one corner of the garage you may be able to use a longer hose instead and have a higher capacity compressor essentially does this compressor need to supply a nail gun on the roof or just fill tires in the garage consider your power source 9 x research source will you have the luxury of electricity at all times or will you be in environments without electricity if you ll be next to an outlet at all times you can choose a drive system with an electric motor most electric air compressors will run on 110v us but some larger ones run on 240v find out before you make the purchase alternatively you ll need to consider mobile air compressor options mobile air compressors can run off gasoline or diesel engines be integrated into a vehicle s existing engine or use a hydraulic port or other pto fortunately there are many modern ways to power an air compressor if using a tank mounted compressor determine how large your tank should be if you ll only need your air compressor for short bursts of time such as when using a nail gun you can get away with having a small tank if you ll be working for extended periods of time with your compressor you ll want the tank to be bigger tank sizes are usually measured in gallons 10 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to move,moving can be both one of the most exciting and most stressful experiences of your life the trick to a painless move is to prepare your bullet proof moving plan well ahead of schedule and

the weeks leading up to your move eat as much of the food in your fridge freezer and pantry as you can so you can avoid heavy cans or melting or messy food items pack for the move though packing your stuff will take a long time as long as you re organized and have a good plan in advance it shouldn t consume your life you should start packing at least a few weeks in advance so you have enough time to pack everything but not so far in advance that you re surrounded by clutter and start packing away the things you ll need here s what to do 1 x research source get your cardboard boxes ready you will need more cardboard boxes than you think you can get them for free from your local grocery store find them under free stuff on craigslist get them from a friend who recently moved or just buy them if you want to save time 2 x expert source marty stevens heebner smm c cpo professional move manager expert interview 14 january 2020 label all of your boxes carefully 3 x expert source marty stevens heebner smm c cpo professional move manager expert interview 14 january 2020 you should write where each box should go on the tops and on the sides of the boxes so you ll know where the boxes should go even if they re stacked on top of each other pack a box of essential items you should do this on the morning or night before your move the box should include bathroom necessities such as toothpaste shampoo soap your shower rods and curtain and towels as well as any overnight essentials like your bedspread blanket pillows and pajamas also if you can t live without caffeine pack away your coffee maker or tea and tea kettle pack all the items that go in the same room in one box don t worry about separating your books from your notebooks if they ll both go in your office just put everything that goes in the same part of your room in one box so you can unpack the stuff more easily have a packing station in your house instead of cluttering each of your rooms with a few boxes pick one place to keep all your packed items keep your hardware in a prominent place make sure your toolbox is on hand when you move so you start assembling your furniture again you can either put it in your essentials box or keep it in the cabin of your moving truck or your car hang on to your essential paperwork hold on to any paperwork that is related to your old home your new home or your moving process don t pack it away with the other stuff that goes in your desk or you won t be able to find it in a pinch ask some trusted friends for help in advance whether your friends are heroically helping you move all of your boxes or if they re just hanging out for moral support you should let them know when you re moving well advance send them an email or give them a call asking for their help on the big moving day don t forget to reward your friends for helping you though they re offering to help you out of the kindness of their hearts you should still make sure to take them out to a restaurant after the move or to order in beer and pizza set up the utilities in your new home and coordinate services and places ahead of your move call ahead to make sure you have heat and electricity in your new home or your move will be off to a very unpleasant start 4 x research source utilities include water gas electric often bundled telephone tv internet also often bundled home security and refuse services that you ll need to coordinate once you move in include address change through the usps website as well as anything tied to your address for example insurance banking or car licenses and registration places to locate include the nearest hospital fire station police station village hall country government post office park district animal hospital library public transportation and school hire a removals van if you re tackling the move by yourself then you ll need to arrange to pick up a removals van on the morning of the move make this arrangement well in advance or it may be tricky to hire a van exactly when you want it for a reasonable price during a busy moving season 5 x research source compare the prices of a few companies before making your decision pick up your vehicle on the morning of the move get there early to avoid waiting in a queue on a busy moving day pack your moving truck packing your moving truck won t be a big challenge if you plan in advance and have the help of a few trusted friends when you do it here are a few things to keep in mind as you pack your moving truck 6 x research source remember that you will need at least two people to handle things other than lifting and hauling they will need to organize the things that need to be loaded by keeping the packed boxes close to the door easily accessible disassemble your furniture take apart any lamps tables with removable legs bookshelves and entertainment systems protect your furniture wrap all of your items with packing paper bubblewrap and tape as you load them into the truck load the heaviest items first into the back of the truck this includes your fridge washer dryer and other appliances as well as your heaviest boxes load the heaviest boxes stack them like bricks to form layers of walls that fill the back of the truck use t stacks to make the boxes more stable make each vertical seam make a t with the horizontal layer below it like bricks in a house avoid vertical pillars of similar sized boxes to maximize space it is essential to stack high stable walls early on next load your longer items into the truck this includes your bed and shelves lean them against the sides of the truck pack your remaining boxes into the truck create three layers of boxes which includes the heaviest boxes on the bottom the medium sized boxes in the middle and the lightest boxes on top once you re done with each layer tape it together with packing tape put in your remaining items the trick is to make everything fit snugly together but don t pack it so tight that it looks ready to explode when using the ramp of a box van such as the vans pictured make sure the ramp has been fitted into place once you have fully extended the ramp from under the truck you will find two prongs that will fit into slots on the lip of the van s cargo space this will ensure that the ramp is flush with the lip and make it a breeze to use the dolly this step is often overlooked make sure the dolly is one of the last things to get loaded so you will have it as soon as you arrive at the new house drive your truck to your new location carefully drive the truck to your new home be prepared to drive slower and more carefully than you would do in a car driving a moving truck takes a big adjustment 7 x research source remember to go slowly and stay calm because the drive may be stressful unload your stuff if at all possible back the truck up to the new house so that the ramp will extend onto the porch use all of your crew as spotters to make sure you are clear of any obstacles when you are close to the porch extend the ramp and hook it in place and have a crew member carry the opposite end most ramps will not latch properly unless the end is on the ground once you have the ramp set up here s how you can unload your stuff have a plan for where you re going to put the large items in each room do a walk through with the movers and show them where the larger items go such as the sofas tv cabinets beds dressers night stands etc choose where to put the boxes and small items in each room based on that 8 x expert source marty stevens heebner smm c cpo professional move manager expert interview 14 january 2020 that way the boxes won t be in the way when the big furniture comes in and you won t have to move the boxes again you can put post it notes on the wall if necessary return your moving truck you will have arranged whether you will do this the same day or the next morning research to find the best company if you want to move with the help of a moving company you will have to spend a lot more money for your move but you will save yourself from the stress of having to move your boxes drive a moving truck and unload your boxes look for a company that has insurance and workers compensation just in case there s an accident 9 x expert source marty stevens heebner smm c cpo professional move manager expert interview 14 january 2020 finding the right moving company is a big commitment so you need to do your research carefully before you make a decision 10 x research source avoid the internet at first this is the easiest way to get caught in a moving scam instead check out the listings in your phone book call a local real estate agent or ask friends for their recommendations pick a place that will do an in home estimate if they won t hang up the phone make sure the company will be doing it themselves and not sub contracting to have someone else do it make sure the company can give you a your rights and responsibilities when you move booklet get as much information about the company as you can try to pick a company that has been in business for at least ten years ask about the included services and for a list of references once you ve narrowed your search to two or three companies go online to find out if they are legitimate you ll need to have the company s dot and mc license numbers to do this now you can make sure that the company is not only authorized to perform your move but that they have insurance to do it 11 x research source first check out safesys org type those dot and mc numbers into the site and see what comes up next make sure the company checks out on the fmcsa licensing insurance site link on the bottom of the report you get about the company last check out the better business report to read up on the company have the company come to make an assessment the company will send a representative to check out all of your stuff and to give you an estimate about how much it will cost to move it all the company will give you an estimate based on what they see in your home 12 x research source don t use a company that will only give you an estimate based on cubic feet if you really want to find the best company you can arrange to have two or three companies to come and make an assessment and pick the one with the best service and best prices but this will be more time consuming make a deal with the moving company decide on a rate that works for both of you and sign a contract that is well detailed and suits your needs never sign a blank contract through your arrangement you will decide on the moving date move with the movers now that you ve chosen your moving company and have decided on a date it s time to prepare for the big move though you won t be doing any heavy lifting you should still be around when the movers transport and unload your stuff this will be an exception if you re arranging them to move your stuff into your new place when you won t be there when the movers are unloading your stuff stay out of their way don t offer to help unless they have questions reward your movers once they ve done their hard work or even while they re doing their hard work order some lunch for them if you want to be nice and make sure to give them a generous tip 13 x research source unpack your stuff now that you ve unloaded your stuff at your new home it s likely that you re feeling overwhelmed have patience and don t force yourself to start unpacking everything right away just focus on getting it done little by little and you ll have your new place ready in no time here s what you can do 14 x research source unpack your essential items first unpack the stuff from your essential stuff box put up your shower curtain in case you need a relaxing shower and make your bed if you just want to collapse try to unpack your kitchen items early on though you should relax and eat take out when you first arrive at your new place you can t do that forever the sooner your kitchen is set up the sooner you can start living a normal life assemble all of your big furniture make sure you assemble it in the room where it belongs do only as much as you can each day though you shouldn t wait months to unpack you are probably overwhelmed after your move so unpack as many boxes as you can until you need a break remember to take the time to enjoy your new surroundings go shopping once you ve started the unpacking process it ll be time to go shopping for any items you may need your shopping can include going to the grocery store to stock your fridge buying any furniture you may need or replacing items you can t find take it one step at a time if you really need a lot of new items make a day of it but if you just need a few things you don t have to do it all at once get to know your new neighborhood once you re far along in the unpacking process or just feel like taking a break it s time to get to know your neighborhood this is a great way to feel more comfortable in your new surroundings and to feel like your stressful move will pay off in the end here s what to do go for a walk not only will this relieve stress and give you great exercise but you will have a better sense of the feel of your neighborhood what your neighbors are like and what stores or parks are near you look online or in a local newspaper to check out cultural attractions bars or restaurants see what your new hood has to offer tell your facebook friends that you ve moved to a new place ask if they have any recommendations of where to go or even where to shop even people you barely know will be happy to offer advice on this topic get to know your neighbors be friendly to the people in your neighborhood you ll end up making more local friends and

how to build a concrete pool,concrete is responsible for some of the highest quality swimming pools ever built when constructed properly a concrete pool lasts for years before requiring basic maintenance or repairs concrete pools are made with shotcrete or gunite mixtures of concrete or sand sprayed onto a metal frame plan carefully and hire contractors to make you a fantastic pool capable of lasting for decades,choose a place to build the pool find a place on your property with enough room for the pool a spacious backyard area is usually the best option note any obstacles that will need to be removed such as trees rocks fences or even utility lines removing these obstacles takes additional time and money 1 x research source think carefully about what you want out of a pool leave space for features like pump systems and diving boards to estimate the size of these features calculate the size of your pool or how much water it will hold then look for suitable products underground obstacles like utility lines are difficult to find without digging call your local utility companies for advice ask them to send a technician to mark the location of your lines the location you choose affects your pool put your pool above a slope so debris doesn t wash into it during rainy days keep it in sunlight to warm the water naturally sketch a basic design for your pool pick up a pencil and a piece of paper then create the pool you plan on constructing settle on the pool s shape and size then begin planning the features including pool steps lighting and other accessories factor in limitations like the yard space you have available to choose the right pool for your situation 2 x research source an average concrete pool is something like 10 ft 20 ft 3 0 m 6 1 m in size with a depth up to 10 ft 3 0 m all of these dimensions can be changed depending on your ideal pool the concrete pool needs to be at least 6 in 15 cm thick so widen and deepen the outline as needed to compensate keep in mind that each additional feature raises the cost and time commitment of building a pool take your design to a professional pool builder for advice search your area for some trustworthy contractors with experience building concrete pools a good contractor will take a look at your plan and give you advice on how to improve it ask to see a valid contractor s license with pool specialty licensing before hiring anyone 3 x research source at the very least you need contractors to approve your design before you can get a building permit you have to do this even if you plan on building the pool yourself look for subcontractors specializing in areas like plumbing and electrical wiring they can help finalize your design apply for the building permits required by your local government since building a pool involves changing the land and lots of safety concerns you have to get a permit before construction starts head to the building department at your local city hall to apply bring your finalized design to show what you plan on constructing 4 x research source if applicable consult your neighborhood s homeowners association guidebook before completing your application some places restrict pools depending on where you live you may need to get a separate electrical permit before beginning construction if you hired a pool builder or subcontractor ask them for help getting the necessary permits many companies handle the application process by default measure and mark the pool s dimensions on the ground use marking chalk to create a temporary outline for the pool spray the chalk directly on the ground note the pool s borders then the placement of walls steps and other accessories that need to be placed during the excavation remember to dig out enough space to create the thick slabs of concrete for the pool s floor and walls dig out the soil to create the basic shape of the pool the quickest way to do this is with a backhoe locate a rental company or hire a subcontractor to get the job done set the excavated soil away from the edge of the pool use a tape measure or marked measuring sticks to keep track of the pool s depth 5 x research source for example if your pool needs to be 6 ft 1 8 m cut a 6 ft 1 8 m pole to use as a reference make references for the deep and shallow end if your pool has them remember that you can always put dirt back if you dig too far down dig out the soil by hand if you can t get a backhoe use a spade or alternative digging tools some areas aren t accessible to heavy equipment and have to be dug out the old fashioned way make sure you have your permit and know about any utility lines in the ground hitting a utility line is a big problem hire a contractor to take care of any utility lines needing to be moved the leftover soil can be sold disposed of by a contractor or repurposed for other projects such as for plant beds level the pool s bottom and walls with a rake even out the bottom of the pool as much as possible with a steel tined rake then take care of the walls flatten the soil as needed with a tamper tool when you re done test various areas of the pool by holding a large carpenter s level over the soil properly leveled pools are stronger and more resistant to damage so take the time to get this foundation perfect 6 x research source to keep track of the pool s levelness install stakes in the pool s corners run strings between them pack the soil to the same height as the string to ensure it stays level throughout the pool shape your pool according to your original design for instance your pool may have a sloped floor make the slope as gradual as possible raking the soil smooth to protect your pool from damage later frame the pool with steel rebar and plywood boards choose rebar rods about 0 625 in 1 59 cm in diameter lay them along the pool s interior in a crisscross pattern spacing them out by 2 1 2 in 6 4 cm keep the rebar about 3 in 7 6 cm above the soil then stand 1 2 in 1 3 cm thick plywood around the upper edge of the pool to prevent poured concrete from spilling out 7 x research source use a rebar bender to fit the metal along the walls bind bars together as needed with metal ties from a hardware store the rebar forms a frame that strengthens the concrete after you pour it always place the rebar net before adding the concrete install the plumbing lines underneath the rebar and plywood refer to your original design to figure out where to place the plumbing lines you will need to dig trenches to guide pvc pipes from the pool to the pump and filtration system make the pipes emerge inside the pool underneath the plywood barrier hook the pipes up to the pump and filter system when you re done 8 x research source contract a plumber to take care of the water lines pool plumbing is complex and building codes vary from community to community a good plumber will make sure your pool works safely wire the pool s filtration system and other electrical components call an experienced electrician to connect pool accessories to your community s electrical grid the electrician will lay wire from the pool s pump and filtration system to your home they will also hook up lighting systems and other optional components in your design 9 x research source leave the electrical work up to a professional messing with community power lines is illegal and dangerous poor wiring increases the risk of fires and electrical shock pour concrete into the pool to create the bottom slab purchase plenty of shotcrete mix or gunite place it all in a mixing truck equipped with a big hose or dumping rail dump the concrete onto the rebar or spray it out with a hose attached to the truck use enough concrete to make the pool floor at least 6 in 15 cm thick 10 x research source to make pouring the concrete easier begin spraying the walls as you lay concrete on the floor so you don t have to walk back and forth across the wet mix as much spray the walls to coat them with concrete put on some sturdy work boots you don t mind getting wet then step into the pool coat the walls to make a layer of concrete at least 6 in 15 cm thick also add concrete to the top lip of the pool marked off by plywood 11 x research source take care not to spray over any exposed pipe openings cap them and spray around them smooth the concrete out with a concrete float step down into the pool to access the concrete slabs you will need a float which is like a big broom for concrete push the float over the floor to level it then do the same for the walls 12 x research source you can also use a big metal straightedge to smooth out difficult spots along walls and corners the straightedge is also helpful for smoothing out steps into a block shape cover the concrete with a plastic sheet for at least 5 days for a long lasting pool let the concrete cure before continuing to work on it purchase a big plastic sheet from a hardware store make sure it covers the entire pool flatten it against the concrete then pin it down with stakes bricks and other heavy objects 13 x research source if you don t have a good plastic cover spray the concrete with water from a hose 3 or 4 times a day keep it saturated to prevent it from drying out you can also place damp canvas or burlap over the concrete to protect it add water to the cover as needed to keep it moist coat the pool basin with tile to waterproof it glass ceramic and porcelain tiles are some of the most popular ways to finish a pool mix mortar then spread it over the concrete with a trowel after waiting at least 24 hours spread grout over the mortar place the tiles on the grout leaving a 1 8 in 0 32 cm gap between each one 14 x research source leave a 6 in 15 cm gap between the lip of the pool and the top row of tiles make sure the mortar and grout resist chlorine and other chemicals in the water tile lasts up to 10 years on average and resist stains better than other finishes though it tends to be a little more expensive some other finishes to try include plaster stone or a water resistant epoxy paint alternative finishes last 5 to 8 years on average install coping around the lip of the pool coping is visible and provides walking room around the pool s edge tile is a common option but you can also get concrete marble or stone each style adds a different aesthetic to your pool but they all waterproof the exposed concrete wait at least 1 to 2 days for the tile and coping to cure before adding water to the pool 15 x research source install the coping with mortar and grout like you did when lining the pool s interior cover the 6 in 15 cm gap you left inside the pool then arrange another row of coping material around the pool s rim fill the pool with water you now have a concrete pool in your yard all you need to do to make it functional is add the water run garden hoses from nearby water spigots to begin doing this takes a long time so find alternative ways to bring in more water try renting a water truck to dump large amounts of water into the pool 16 x research source if you can t get a truck to the pool continue using a hose it may take all day but with a little patience you will soon have a functional pool watch the pool for leaks and other issues empty the pool before attempting a fix,Home-and-Garden
how to build a safe room,your safety and the safety of your family and friends is the top priority if you live in a part of the country that has extreme weather such as windstorms tornadoes or hurricanes it s important to have an area in your home or business that can keep you safe during times of emergency it s also important to plan for safety in the event of a home invasion or robbery a safe room is a reinforced secure and well stocked area that can keep you safe in times of emergencies if you are skilled at construction you can build a safe room that will help to ensure that your family will be safe and protected no matter what the future brings,plan for safety before building your safe room you must take several factors into account to ensure that the safe room serves its purpose of protecting its occupants and does not pose a hazard it is crucial that you start by reading the government manual available at www fema gov pdf plan prevent rms 453 fema453 pdf this manual will provide design considerations potential risks structural design criteria information about air filtration and other considerations that will keep you and your family safe if you do not read this manual you risk designing a safe room that could put your family at risk through faulty design or construction however the details provided by fema in their p 320 drawing series are at least for wood framed construction only a starting point learn about the particulars the safe room s construction and design must be reinforced and built to withstand storms and threats of attack be sure you understand these factors as you plan and build the safe room there are 5 levels of tornadoes and 5 levels of hurricanes for instance each demanding different levels of protection if you live in an area that has never experienced an ef 3 tornado there is questionable need to have an ef 4 rated shelter for instance the room must be constructed out of material that can withstand high winds as well as heavy debris that may be flying around for instance in a tornado situation concrete walls are a great choice but if you want to adapt an existing wooden walled room you can reinforce the insides of the walls with steel sheathing 1 x research source the room should not have windows but if it does they should be very small too small for a burglar to crawl through and constructed of plexiglass to prevent shattering 2 x research source the room must be anchored securely to ensure that it does not lift or overturn in high winds or a tornado 3 x research source you will need to design the walls door and ceiling to be able to stand up to high wind pressure as well as resist penetration or crushing from flying or falling debris note that fema s p 320 design guidelines make no mention of the varying storm strengths and thus appear to be designed to protect against an ef 5 tornado which has twice the wind speed of an ef 2 that does not mean however that protection against an ef 2 tornado need be only half as strong a structural engineer will be needed to make those decisions 4 x research source you need to make sure that the spaces where the room is connected like wall and ceiling joints are designed to withstand wind additionally the structure should be independent of surrounding rooms in your home or business so that any damage done to the home will not affect the safe room 5 x research source a below ground safe room must be able to withstand flooding or water accumulation in the event of heavy rains 6 x research source the door should open inwards in the event that a storm piles debris outside the door it should also be constructed of heavy material that cannot be kicked in by an intruder or blown in by a storm solid wood or metal doors are a good option consider using an exterior heavy wooden door for an interior safe room and reinforce the sides with metal for added security 7 x research source know the best place to build or create a safe room the safest place for a safe room is underground a first floor interior room is also a good location 8 x research source if you have a basement this is the most ideal location for a safe room if you are concerned about tornadoes or other storms with high winds it is the most secure location away from exterior walls 9 x research source the garage is also a great option as it usually has quite a bit of space for construction and provided you keep the garage tidy less risk of falling debris during a storm 10 x research source plan the type of safe room you need depending on the number of people you need to accommodate the available space you have to work in and your budget your choices might vary the goal is to be safe but some safe rooms may be more convenient or attractive than others a yard bunker safe room is designed to be dug into and installed underground one outside door opens to above ground and you can purchase units to fit any number of people steel or concrete is your best choice because fiberglass shelters run the risk of cracking above ground shelters can be attached to the outside of a home or they can be situated within the interior some can be designed so that they are indiscernible to the untrained eye and other rooms are large enough to accommodate many people for example at a school or church these can be built or purchased prefabricated which is slightly pricier but will ensure that they are built to code if you are in the construction phase of a new home or business the safe room can be built into the plans as an additional room in the building obtain or create a construction plan before beginning construction its important to create accurate plans that are designed to government specifications this will ensure that your safe room can live up to its name you can obtain free safe room construction plans and specifics at https www fema gov media library assets documents 2009 you can use these to design your own safe room or work with a contractor on its construction purchase code guidelines to help you plan to build your storm safe room to code these guidelines are written by the international code council which sets code standards worldwide gather your supplies and begin construction depending on the plan you follow you will need various supplies potentially including concrete steel bars a heavy wooden door and deadbolts consider using anchors that are power driven around the unit s wall perimeter to avoid horizontal movement and uplift in relation to the concrete floor slab these are available for masonry as well as wood framed construction to avoid vertical movement of the roof assembly look into simpson strong tie anchors for wood framed structures be sure that your ceiling and walls are securely anchored to the bottom plate fema s p 320 design guidelines should be consulted but due to their incompleteness and errors with respect to metal ties be cautious wood framed structures will use plywood as protection against flying debris and on each side of the stud framing to strengthen the wall the layers and thicknesses will depend on what amount of protection you desire a layer of sheet steel or kevlar can be added again according to the amount of protection you need placing any inside protection on the room side and any outside protection under the outside plywood or you can fill between the studs with masonry units install a door with a 2 inch 5 cm dead bolt lock select your room to retrofit retrofitting an existing room in your home or business is the cheapest and simplest way to protect your loved ones from storms or intruders while building or installing a prefabricated safe room can cost between 2500 6000 you can retrofit an existing room for a thousand or less choose a room that is in the interior of the house with no windows or skylight and no walls shared with the outdoors a large walk in closet works well 11 x research source replace the door a safe room needs a door that can withstand high winds or being kicked in by an intruder and should ideally open inwards rather than outwards in case debris is stacked outside the room during a storm remove the existing door and doorjamb replace the doorjamb with a steel one and reinforce the surrounding wood with steel angle iron which will prevent the door from being kicked or blown in 12 x research source replace the door with a heavy solid wood door such as one sold as an exterior front door for a home or with a heavy steel door mount it so that it opens inwards rather than out 13 x research source install locks you can choose if you want to use a traditional deadbolt or a keyless deadbolt the keyless deadbolt has the advantage that you don t have to find the key in case of an emergency but can be dangerous if you have small children in your household who may lock themselves inside 14 x research source before installing the new locks and doorknob reinforce the wood around them by installing steel or brass strike plates which you can purchase at most hardware stores 15 x research source install the locks so that the door locks from the inside if it s a traditional deadbolt be sure to make a copy of the key and keep the keys in two separate but easily accessible locations where you can find them immediately in case of emergency reinforce the walls and ceiling if you are adding the safe room to new construction you can reinforce the walls and ceiling with concrete chicken wire or steel sheeting before adding dry wall and paint to the walls if not you will need to tear out the existing drywall to reinforce the walls the most cost effective way to reinforce the walls is by pouring concrete into the cavity between the 2x4s in the walls then screw plywood or 1 1 8 oriented strand board to the 2x4s on either side you can then cover this with drywall and paint 16 x research source you can also screw steel sheeting to the 2x4s and cover with drywall and paint you will need to use steel sheeting or chicken wire in the ceiling which can be done from the attic if you re in a one story home or applied directly to the ceiling less attractive but chances are good no one will be looking at the ceiling of your closet safe room contact a contractor for help if you want to create a more complicated or stand alone structure its important that it is up to code if you don t have a lot of experience with construction you can contact a contractor or local storm shelter company for help planning and installing your project ask around for recommendations of local contractors ask family or friends who have recently remodeled or done construction work or contact the national association of the remodeling industry or a local building inspector who will be able to point you in the right direction 17 x research source consider luxury details a basic safe room will keep your family safe but if you want to add additional features for a more high end safe room particularly for a very expensive home that is at risk of burglary you have several options a camera monitoring system a high end security system installed by professionals can allow you to monitor your home from the inside of the safe room in the event of a home invasion 18 x research source a keypad entry a keypad can allow you to lock the door to the safe room instantly in the event of a home invasion instead of wasting precious time locking deadbolts 19 x research source stock your safe room with food and water in the event of a storm or terrorist attack you may have to stay in the safe room longer than expected it s important to be prepared with essentials for your family as well as any unexpected guests who may have to share your safe space start with a minimum of three gallons of water per person that fits in the occupancy of the room 20 x research source its easy to see how supplies can quickly fill up the safe room space if you have a safe room that accommodates five people you ll need fifteen gallons of water store nonperishable food items in the safe room such as cans of beans or ready to eat soup don t forget a can opener boxes of cookies or crackers granola or protein bars and cans of infant formula or powdered milk while it s a good idea to plan for a three day stay in the shelter if you have enough space it s a good idea to store more in the off chance that a hurricane or tornado could wipe out the neighborhood you might need more supplies to help support your neighbors until help arrives remember to periodically rotate your supplies so that nothing expires or goes rancid even nonperishable foods expire eventually consider other supplies you might need in the event of a storm you may need other supplies to support you and your family until the storm is over or until help arrives you will need a battery operated radio at least one large flashlight and several extra batteries 21 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency

how to desalinate water,desalination or the removal or salt from water can be used to produce drinkable water from seawater or brackish water 1 x research source scientists are studying ways to use desalination on a global scale but you can desalinate water yourself with just a mug a bowl and some sunlight,use bottled drinking water and iodized salt before you can desalinate the water you will need to create saline water or salt water do this by buying a bottle of drinking water and iodized salt from your local grocery store you can also use a bottle of tap water if you do not want to buy a bottle of water 2 x research source if you happen to live near an ocean you can skip these materials and fill a bottle with seawater seawater is full of salt and great for use in the desalination process get a heavy ceramic mug and a large glass bowl you will use the ceramic mug as a container for the desalinated water and the large glass bowl will act as a receptacle for the salt during the desalination process the glass bowl should be big enough to fit the mug 3 x research source you will also need a piece of plastic cling wrap enough to go over the glass bowl and a small weight like a rock make sure you have access to a spot with direct sunlight like a window sill you will need to place your desalination device in direct sunlight to warm up the water in the device and create humid air the humid air will then condense into water droplets that you can drink 4 x research source pour 1 inch of drinking water into the mug you do not want to fill the mug up too much just until it appears 1 inch deep with water 5 x research source mix enough salt into the water so it tastes salty start with a small amount of iodized salt and taste it to ensure it is salty make sure you fill the mug with more water if you drink some of it as you want there to be a depth of about 1 inch of water in the mug put the salt water into the large glass bowl you will then need to rinse and dry the mug to ensure there is not salt residue in the mug 6 x research source once you have rinsed and dried the mug you can put it in the center of the glass bowl in the 1 inch of salt water cover the glass bowl with plastic cling wrap make sure the cling wrap is stretched tightly over the mug and the sides of the bowl with no open areas around the rim of the bowl place the bowl in direct sunlight look for a window sill or a spot on your deck outside that gets lots of direct sunlight and make sure the bowl is on a nice even surface in the sun 7 x research source place the small weight or rock on the top of the plastic wrap right above the cup the plastic wrap should sag in the center of the cup due to the weight of the rock this will ensure the condensed water falls into the cup so you can drink it leave the bowl in the sun for three to four hours after several hours in the sun there will be a build up of humid air in the bowl this will lead to the formation of water condensation on the plastic wrap the water droplets should then flow downward into the cup check the cup for fresh water after the bowl has been in the sun for three to four hours check the cup for a small amount of water remove the plastic wrap and drink the water in the cup you should taste pure clean fresh water that has been desalinated 8 x research source this desalination device works by using the sun to warm up the salt water the plastic wrap helps to trap the water vapors in the bowl as the salt water evaporates because the top of the plastic wrap is much cooler than the rest of the bowl the humid air in the bowl condenses on the top of the plastic wrap and forms water droplets over time the water droplets on the plastic wrap grow larger and start to flow to the center of the bowl due to the weight of the rock as the water droplets build up they grow heavier and eventually fall into the cup the result of this simple desalination device is a cup of fresh drinking water that does not contain any salt,Home-and-Garden
how to build a pulley,pulleys are simple machines that make lifting heavy objects easier they distribute weight to reduce the amount of force it takes to lift something up with a compound pulley you can lift an object using half the force it takes to lift the same object with a simple pulley you can easily make either type of pulley using a few simple objects around your home,cut through the middle of a wire hanger use a pair of scissors or wire cutters to cut through the bottom of a wire hanger make sure your cut is directly in the middle of the hanger so you can easily put your spool on leave the top of the hanger intact so you can hang it when you use your pulley 1 x research source if you don t have a wire hanger you can make the axle for your pulley by propping a broomstick between 2 tables or counters instead secure it in place by setting a heavy object on one end of the stick put a thread spool onto the bottom of the hanger and bend it closed gently pry open the cut you made in the hanger and slide a thread spool on it the size of the spool doesn t matter as long as it fits onto the hanger slide both parts of the hanger through the center of the spool and use pliers to bend the ends into hooks to keep the spool in place 2 x research source you can buy a spool from a craft store or you may reuse one that you already have from thread or twine hang the pulley system on a rod or dowel look for an open rod or dowel in a closet or set one up between 2 tables if you need to set a weight on top of the rod to prevent it from spinning or moving around use the hook on the hanger to hang it on the rod or dowel 3 x research source loop a string over the top of the pulley cut a piece of string or twine so it s about twice as long as the distance from the floor to the bottom of the wire hanger drape one side of the string over the spool so both sides are the same length 4 x research source if you plan on doing a lot of experiments with pulleys you can tie a small metal hook to one end of the string so it s easier to hang weights 5 x research source you can also use twine if you want your pulley to be slightly stronger tie weights to one end of the string use things that are lightweight such as a few washers or a thin textbook as your weights tie the end of the string around your objects so they don t fall out while you re lifting them let the loose end of your string hang down freely on the other side of the spool set the weight on the floor to start your experiment pulleys make your work easier by distributing the weight and forces across the different sides of strings be careful not to choose anything too heavy since it will cause the metal hanger to bend and deform pull down on one end of the rope to lift up the weight grab the loose end of the string and pull it straight down the spool will rotate around the hanger and reduce the amount of friction making it easier to lift the weight on the other side tie the loose end of the string to a sturdy object if you want to suspend your weights in the air keep trying the pulley with different weights to see how much you can lift 6 x research source place 2 cardboard boxes across from one another on a raised surface use 2 boxes that are the same size and thickness such as cereal or packing boxes set the boxes on a flat surface like a table so they re about 5 6 in 13 15 cm apart make sure the edges of the boxes are parallel with one another 7 x research source thicker boxes will be able to support more weight while thinner boxes are more likely to rip while you use your pulley slide a thread spool onto the middle of a pencil use an old wooden spool or one that you bought from a craft store slide a pencil through the center of the spool to create an axle that it can rotate freely around 8 x research source you can also buy pulley wheels from your local hardware store if you don t have any spools poke 2 sets of holes in the boxes so they re 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm apart sharpen a different pencil and slowly poke the point through one of the boxes make another hole in the second box that lines up with the first hole you made make another set of holes 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm from the first set 9 x research source put both pencils in the holes so they re perpendicular to the sides of the box feed the eraser end of one of the pencils through the hole in one box and the pointed end in the hole across from it then put the pencil with the spool in the other set of holes make sure the boxes are spaced about 5 6 inches 13 15 cm apart and the spool is in the center of the pencil 10 x research source make sure the pencils fit tightly in the sides of the boxes if it doesn t use modeling clay inside the boxes to hold it in place tie one end of a string to the pencil without the spool cut your string so it s twice as long as the height of your boxes from the floor loop the string around your pencil and tie a knot to secure it in place drape the loose end of the string over the spool on the other pencil 11 x research source you can also tie the string around the pencil before you put it in the box slide a paperclip onto the string so it s between the 2 pencils feed the other end of your string through the center loop of the paperclip keep sliding the paper clip down the string until it s between the 2 pencils let the paper clip rest on the table surface for now 12 x research source if you don t want the paperclip to move around you can tie a knot in the string to secure it in place hang a small load on the paper clip bend open the paperclip to form a small hook and slide a few small weights on it such as washers or metal beads make sure the weight rests on the table surface and isn t suspended in the air 13 x research source try using the same size weight that you used on your simple pulley so you can compare the difference between the 2 of them heavier weights may rip through the boxes or break the string pull the string over the spool to lift the load the spool will rotate around the pencil and make the weight easier to lift since the other end of your string is tied to the pencil you will use half the force that it would take to lift it with a single pulley 14 x research source because the weight is distributed between the string and the spool you can move the weight twice as far with the half the amount of force you can add more spools and pencils to make lifting the weight easier,Home-and-Garden

enforcement officials may be able to issue a citation call your local code enforcement to find out how to file a claim then report your landlord for not complying with local codes 17 x research source if your area doesn t have code enforcement call your city council official mayor s office city manager s office or the law enforcement non emergency line they can advise you on who to contact about this issue consider a lawsuit if nothing else helps you can sue your landlord to force them to address the secondhand smoke and you might sue your neighbor for damages however it s often expensive and difficult to pursue a lawsuit so it s best to only do it if you have no other options if you think a lawsuit is right for you talk to a lawyer to find out if you have a case 18 x research source you ll need to prove that secondhand smoke is harming you so make sure you have good documentation about what s been happening additionally it s best to have medical records that show you re being treated for conditions related to the smoke,Home-and-Garden
how to get a land survey,land surveys are of utmost importance when purchasing new land or a new piece of property and if you are building anything new near the property line such as a fence or a shed getting a survey can keep you out of expensive legal trouble fortunately there are a few ways to get a land survey done and find a good price for the service,determine if you need to have a survey done there are 6 situations in which a land survey should be performed 1 x research source get a survey done if you are buying a new piece of property the reason is simple you need to make sure that what you think you re buying is actually what you re buying most lenders will require a survey anyway get a survey done if you are constructing anything new on your property most zoning ordinances and neighborhood codes will specify a required setback from your property line if you don t know precisely where your property line is you won t be able to adhere to this regulation get a survey done if your property has any access easements all property owners are entitled to access their property and this often requires getting easements to allow the use of a neighboring land parcel for access easements should specify very clearly the centerline and width of any access corridors get a survey done if you are selling your property having a current survey on file will greatly improve the marketability of your home buyers will be more interested in your property if you give them the confidence that a proper survey has been performed get a survey done if you need to verify the acreage of your property for tax assessments your local jurisdiction may require you to have a current survey on file to correctly assess property taxes get a survey done if your neighbor starts building anything new if you suspect your neighbor is encroaching on your property or violating setback regulations you need a survey on your own property to initiate any legal action contact several local surveying firms to get cost estimates have your deed ready because surveyors will generally not give an estimate unless they have a copy of your deed explain the reason why you need a survey and any other concerns you might have 2 x research source compare the estimates from the surveyors you contacted good surveying firms will do their research before providing a bid make sure that they ve checked for any previous surveys done on your property by government offices or private surveyors surveys will cost less if some of the boundaries can be quickly verified through previous surveys 3 x research source select a surveyor when you re happy with a company s bid sign the contract included with the bid and return it to the company you will generally have to pay a retainer fee at this point make sure that you clearly understand how long it will take the surveyor to complete the survey before contracting with them 4 x research source allow the surveyor to perform the survey when the job is done you should receive a signed certificate from them certifying that the survey has been recorded 5 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to make a clothes line,drying clothes on a clothesline is a green option dryers are one of the household appliances that use the most energy so using a clothesline not only helps the earth but also saves you money making your own clothesline is a practical innovative option for those who are environmentally conscious or on a budget,find out if you can have a clothesline not all neighborhoods subdivisions and cities allow clotheslines some people believe that they look bad in yards or neighborhoods check with your home owner s association or city ordinances mark an area where you will place the clothesline most loads of clothes use 35 feet of line the length of line needs to accommodate at least one load the area you place the clothesline in shouldn t be a high traffic area make sure it s not in an area where people or dogs frequently walk you also don t want the clothesline to hang over anything like flowers a pool or shrubbery don t make the line any longer than that the longer the line the more sag the line will have 1 x research source avoid placing your clothesline under trees that drip sap leaves or other material you also want to avoid placing your clothesline under trees with a lot of birds 2 x research source if you want to dry colored clothes make sure there is a spot in the shade so the colors don t fade you can spread clotheslines between multiple posts or multiple trees if you plan on drying many loads at one time determine how high the poles should be when building your clothesline you want to make sure that it is the proper height you don t want the clothesline to be too tall so that you can t easily hang your clothes on the other hand you don t want the line to be too low so that larger items such as blankets and sheets touch the ground the wood for your posts need to be taller than how high you want the poles part of the pole will be in ground for a 6 ft clothesline you will need at least wood that is 8 ft tall purchase the materials to make a proper clothesline you need to purchase the right materials you will need 2 4 x 4 x 10 treated wood posts 2 2 x 2 x 8 treated wood posts 8 1 4 x 6 hot dip galvanized lag screws and washers 2 1 4 x 8 galvanized lag bolts 8 eye hooks 2 clothesline tighteners 2 quick links 100 ft clothesline 2 bags quikrete 3 x research source gather the tools to make a clothesline you will have to saw wood drill holes for bolts and dig a hole into the ground to accomplish this you need the following tools miter saw drill and bits clamps post level post hole diggers bucket optional measure the posts most clotheslines are approximately 6 ft tall two 10 ft posts work well for this because it gives you the height and allows 3 4 ft of the post to be buried underground you can also use a 8 8 1 2 ft post instead if the posts are too long you need to cut them however these two posts may not need to be cut at all if you live in a climate that experiences a deep freeze in the winter make sure to put your posts below the freeze line so they don t shift decide if that is 3 or 4 ft or more 4 x research source you may also need to bury the post deeper in the ground if you live in an area with sandy or unstable soil cut the angles in your crossbeams take the two 8 ft posts and cut them in half this will give you four 4 ft posts then take two of the 4 ft beams and cut them in half so you have four 2 ft beams these will be used for the cross braces that should give you one 4 ft crossbeam and two 2 ft braces for each clothesline post cut 45 degree angles into the ends of the 2 ft beams to do this adjust your miter saw to the 45 angle these beams will be the braces make sure you double check your angles before cutting the wood messing up the angle means you will have to get another piece of wood the crosspiece can be around 3 ft long if you want you can also cut the ends of the crosspiece at an angle if you don t want flat edges drill the holes measure and mark the center of the crossbeam and the center of the top of the post the center mark will be on the edge of the crossbeam at the top that faces the sky the center mark on the post will be on the top which is the edge that the brace sits on drill a hole that is a little narrower than the lag bolt in the center where you made your mark connect the crossbeam to the post with the lag bolt when complete the crossbeam will sit on top of the post in the shape of a t screw the braces to the posts fit the braces against the post and crossbeam you want to drill the holes near the bottom at an angle so it will connect to the post and then through the top so it will connect to the crossbeam and brace drill holes into these areas making sure the hole is centered on the wood the braces will fit snugly against the beam and post because of the angle you cut into each end clamp the wooden braces in place to stabilize them 5 x research source drill the holes into the beams and screw in the bolts install the eye hooks measure the spaces for your eye hooks evenly along the crossbeam make sure not to start at the very edge try starting around 6 inches from the edge for 4 hooks you want to space them 10 12 inches apart pre drill the holes and then twist the eye hooks into the holes you can use the handle of your screwdriver to twist the hooks into the wood you may want to install 3 eye hooks instead of 4 depending on the length of your crossbeam 6 x research source dig the holes use post hole diggers to dig the holes where you marked them earlier the holes need to be about 1 2 ft deep if you live in a warmer climate and 3 4 ft deep if you live in an area that is prone to deep freezes or a sandy area 7 x research source the holes need to be 12 in wide 8 x research source before you dig any holes in your yard double check to make sure there are no gas water cable or telephone lines in the area where you are digging level the posts drop the clothesline posts into the holes place a post level onto the post make sure to get the posts level before pouring any concrete get someone to help you or try adding dirt and packing it into the hole to help hold it while you adjust 9 x research source pour concrete pour 1 bag of dry concrete mix into each hole add water from the garden hose mix the concrete with a mixing stick to combine the concrete until it is a uniform consistency use the level again to make sure the posts are level before the concrete has a chance to set let the concrete set for 24 72 hours 10 x research source you may want to pour the bag out in stages this may make it easier to mix and keep the post level as you add the concrete continue to tamp it down with each new section of concrete so that everything is as compact as possible 11 x research source you can also mix the concrete in buckets before you pour it into the holes use rope or heavy string to keep the post straight while the concrete dries replace the dirt once the concrete has completely dried shovel the dirt back on top to cover the concrete pack the dirt down to make sure the hole is secure attach tighteners connect two clothesline tighteners to outside eye hooks on one post you can buy these at home improvement stores the tighteners allow you to make sure that your line is taut without sag and also allows you to tighten the line if it starts to sag over the years from weather and use attach clothesline buy a 100 ft cloth clothesline from a home improvement store cut the clothesline in half tie one end of the rope to the inside eye hook beside the tightener if your posts are too far apart you might have to buy two packs 100 ft cloth clothesline and string one through each side cut off the excess when you re finished if you want to prevent frayed ends tape the ends of the rope or burn them with a cigarette lighter stretch the clothesline between the poles pull the rope to the opposite post and loop it through the matching inside eye hook pull it across and through the outside eye hook stretch the rope back across to the original post where it should meet up with the tightener pull the rope through the tightener tighten the rope trim any excess rope each rope should go through 4 eye hooks in all one on the inside and one on the outside on each post install pulleys instead another option is to attach pulleys to the eye hooks instead of tying the rope directly to the hooks and looping around pulleys can be purchased at home improvement stores attach them to all eye hooks wrap the clothesline around both pulleys on either post tie one end of the rope to the hook on the end of a tightener and pull the other end of the rope through the tightener you will have a movable tight loop of rope threaded through each pulley 12 x research source make sure to knot both ends securely and cut off any excess rope,Home-and-Garden
how to clear land,clearing land can definitely be a big job but if you take it step by step it is doable start by sizing up the situation to determine how much of the job you can handle yourself and which portions of the project might require outside help once you ve determined if you need the help of a contractor or other expert just take things a bit at a time clear away any standing debris for instance then fell any trees and cut down remaining vegetation after you patch up any holes and smooth out the land it will be ready to go,decide if you need outside help if you are working a large plot it can take a lot of time you should also inspect your land to see if there is anything that would make clearing it especially difficult like very large trees or steep hillsides if you don t have the time tools or know how this is a job you should get a contractor or other expert to help out with depending on the complexity of your project you might hire a contractor to do all of the land clearing for you alternatively you could hire people to take care of some aspects of the land clearing and handle others yourself for instance you might feel prepared to clear brush and fell small trees but could hire an arborist or logging company to handle any that are especially large check and see if you need a permit depending on where you live there might be protected vegetation concern about soil erosion or other factors that impact land clearing before you take on a big project check with your local land planning agency to determine if you need permits 1 x research source if you hire a contractor they may be able to handle the permit process for you set a budget contractors may work on a fixed price per square foot or land if you have a large plot this means the overall cost can rise quickly even if you are planning on clearing the land yourself expect to have some costs for running and maintaining your equipment buying any necessary tools or supplies paying for the removal or dumping of debris etc 2 x research source contractor costs will vary depending on your location and the equipment needed get an estimate from a contractor if you will use one before you settle on a contractor shop around ask a few to give you an estimated price for clearing your land then choose the best contractor you can within your budget contractor costs will be based on things like 3 x research source the size of the plot how quickly the land needs to be cleared whether the plot has any features that make clearing difficult steep hills remote location unusual soil types etc the time of year whether any subcontractors will need to be hired demolish any existing structures if there are any old buildings sheds stables or other structures on the land you ll need to knock these down use a wrecker bulldozer or other heavy equipment to take care of the job quickly when you re done dispose of the debris 4 x research source check with local sanitation companies to see if you can rent a large construction dumpster for the debris remove standing debris rocks fallen limbs and trash will all need to be out of the way picking these things up will make it easier to get equipment in to clear vegetation and trees 5 x research source consider checking with local excavation companies sand and gravel suppliers and other heavy equipment dealers to see if you can rent a debris grate this is a large heavy front loading piece of machinery that may help in the debris removal process if there are any boulders you need removed wrap a heavy duty chain around them then attach the chain to a tractor and drag them out of the way mark and protect all desired vegetation that can t be temporarily moved fence off any trees that you want to keep with brightly colored construction fencing or wrap landscape fabric around their base to protect them install fencing around smaller plants as well use brightly colored forestry flagging ribbon to clearly mark all desired vegetation mark all low tree branches with ribbon to avoid damage caused by operating equipment under the tree canopy continue providing water to the plants as needed fell any trees if you know how to work a chainsaw you can handle a small plot without much trouble if you have a large plot with lots of trees however rent some professional equipment to make the job quicker and easier 6 x research source you can have the felled trees hauled away or if you prefer you can cut the trees into firewood or put a mulching attachment on a skid steer machine to make them into mulch very large trees or ones with dangerously decayed limbs are best left to professionals grub any remaining tree stumps to remove a tree stump called grubbing start by digging down to the roots all around it with a shovel attach a heavy duty chain around the stump and then use a tractor to pull it out 7 x research source clear brush there are many options for clearing out vegetation you could use hand held trimmers to cut the vegetation at ground level if the job is not too big if there s a lot of land to cover rent a brush machine to tear through it more quickly you can compost burn or shred the debris according to your preference 8 x research source if you have low ground vegetation you can use grazing animals like sheep or goats to clear it sometimes these animals can work surprisingly quickly 9 x research source goats can even eat poison ivy without being harmed saving you from some potentially irritating trouble in some locations you can rent grazing animals for this purpose fill in holes and grade the land if you have any holes created by removing stumps boulders or other debris shovel loose dirt into these tamp the dirt down into the holes until it is compact add more dirt if necessary and repeat until the surface is level 10 x research source if you are planning to construct something on the cleared land a contractor will most likely use a professional grader to smooth things out plow if you want to farm or landscape the area turning the soil with a plow is an extra step to make sure the ground is even if there is any organic matter like grass or leaves on top of the soil plowing will also mix this in so that valuable nutrients are added back in 11 x research source avoid plowing wet or steep land instead let native vegetation cover the area this helps prevent soil erosion,Home-and-Garden
how to set up a small solar photovoltaic power generator,the goal of this article is to show how to set up a small solar power generator while there are a lot of decisions you can make this particular how to focuses on small scale solar generation 1kwh day and simplifies it so that just about anyone can set up a functioning system however beware that compromises in efficiency safety and code adherence may be made for the sake of simplicity,decide how much power you need to do so determine which electronic devices you would like to use then find out how much power they use most devices have wattage ratings which can then be multiplied by the number of hours of use to produce watt hours wh which is a unit of power consumption for example if you intend to use a 15w device for 2 hours a day that s 15w x 2h 30wh note however that ratings are usually higher than the actual power consumption to determine how much a device actually draws you can use a meter like the kill a watt once you have all the watt hours add them up if the total exceeds 1000wh or 1 kilowatt hour this how to may not be suitable for you 1 x trustworthy source u s department of energy official site for the u s department of energy which provides resources related to energy safety conservation and efficiency go to source determine how much unobstructed sunlight you receive in the location you intend to set up solar panels unobstructed literally means that there are no shadows if a tree neighboring building or anything else casts a shadow in that particular spot don t count the time during which a shadow exists so if you get 12 hours of sunlight but the sun is beyond the fence for 2 hours in the morning then behind a tree for an hour at noon then shadowed by your neighbor s barn for 2 hours before sunset you only get to count 7 hours note also that days are shorter in winter if you intent to use your set up in winter use your winter hours 2 x research source divide your total power consumption from step 1 by the number of hours you came up with in step 2 if you decide you need 600wh and that you get 6h of sunlight that s 600wh 6h 100w this is the amount of power you need to generate per hour of sunlight to meet your needs to be safe multiply that by at least 2 or more this is to account for the fact that solar panels only generate their rated output when pointed directly at the sun and if your solar panels are fixed they won t be facing directly at the sun most of the time after various inefficiencies you may lose another 20 or more of the power generated if you expect regular and sustained cloud coverage you may need to multiply by 5 or more or simply reduce consumption to live within your means 3 x research source buy solar panels broadly speaking there are 3 types of solar panels strictly speaking photovoltaic cells amorphous silicon polycrystalline and monocrystalline amorphous silicon panels are relatively inexpensive relatively unaffected by small shadows but are very inefficient in terms of space for the same power rating amorphous silicon panels will be larger and heavier polycrystalline panels are more efficient cheaper than monocrystalline but also less efficient monocrystalline panels are the most efficient but also the most expensive output from mono and polycrystalline panels can be halved or less by even a tiny shadow because of the way individual cells are wired mono and poly crystalline panels can be purchased these days can under 1 per watt 4 x research source consider b grade panels which are significantly cheaper yet come with reasonable warranties while some people want their panels to last 25 years the reality is that the cost of pv cells are coming down so rapidly that replacing or augmenting your panels in another 5 10 years may actually be cheaper than paying more now for ones that last longer if the solar panels are more expensive than your budget allows consider lowering your power consumption turning off or forgoing some devices won t kill you and if it will this how to is not for you calculate the amount of battery capacity you need to do this take the power consumption estimated in step 1 then double it because only about half the batteries capacity should be considered usable to avoid over discharge then multiply by the number of days reserve you would like for instance if you want to use 600wh you need 1200wh or 1 2kwh of capacity so if you had 3 6kwh you ll be good for a few days even if the sun disappears though you may have other problems at that point since most batteries have capacities in amp hours it may be best to convert wh to ah to do so divide the capacity you calculated by the battery s voltage so 3600wh 12v 300ah divide by 6 for 6v batteries 5 x research source buy batteries while normal car batteries will work for a while it is best to use deep cycle batteries which are generally marketed for use in rvs and boats some people prefer 6v golf cart batteries which are designed to withstand repeated deep discharges if using 6v batteries connect two in series positive terminal of one connects to negative of the other then connect pairs in parallel positive of one pair with positive of the other pair negative with negative if your budget allows you may consider agm batteries which can take more abuse but also cost 2 3x what lead acid batteries cost make sure the ah ratings of all batteries added together is higher than the capacity you calculated in the previous step if using multiple batteries make sure to get multiples of the same battery and to get them all new or reconditioned at the same time mixing different capacity model or age batteries can shorten all of their lifespans 6 x research source buy a charge controller charge controllers can cost as little as 10 or over 100 the most important thing is to actually use a charge controller if you hook up solar panels directly to some batteries the batteries will charge for a while but they could quickly be ruined whichever charge controller you get needs to support the amount of current your solar panels produce most charge controllers are rated in amps so divide the watt rating of your solar panels by 12v e g 200w 12v 17a find a charge controller with a rating higher than your theoretical estimate this will give you a safety margin as well as some headroom for growth in the future beyond that exactly which charge controller to buy is basically a trade off between cost vs efficiency and battery life the more expensive charge controllers will use different charging algorithms best suited to the type of battery you have they also may compensate for temperature to better protect your batteries 7 x research source if you plan on running devices off of ac power i e use normal wall plugs you will also need an inverter there are broadly two types of inverters modified sine wave and pure sine wave pure sine wave inverters give you power that is closer to city power but these inverters tend to be more expensive 150 for a 600w inverter modified sine wave inverters can be much cheaper 30 for a 400w inverter but some devices may not work or work well with them note also that inverters have 80 90 efficiency which means you lose some power in the dc to ac conversion however if you ve followed all previous steps as recommended your set up should have the excess capacity to absorb this inefficiency 8 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to live on the street,people find themselves living on the streets for a variety of reasons often because they have no other choice while living on the streets can feel impossible there are strategies to make it manageable with a bit of planning you can make living on the streets possible,keep a blanket with you lack of sleep is a major issue for individuals living on the streets because you let down your guard when you fall asleep always carry your blanket so that you can take advantage of a good sleeping opportunity 1 x research source sleeping bags are warm and suitable for outdoors try a bivy sack which is like a body sized tent it is collapsible and will protect you from the elements if you live in a very cold area sleeping on the ground is risky even if you have a sleeping bag and warm clothes because the ground will absorb your body heat you will need an inflatable insulated sleeping pad to keep in your heat sleep in groups if you are able to make friends with other individuals who are living on the street arrange to sleep in a group so that you can designate lookouts your group doesn t have to be large to be effective even one trusted individual can make sleeping safer 2 x research source get to know someone before you trust them with your safety remember that you are all trying to survive try a shelter shelters offer a roof and usually showers but they can be difficult to get into most cities have one and many cities with a high concentration of homeless people have multiple shelters google maps can help you locate the shelters in your area be aware of your surroundings when you sleep in a shelter because other people in the shelter may pose a threat 3 x research source shelters are commonly non profit but some are for profit you may be charged a fee for using the shelter so discuss your options before taking a bed sleep during the day you are most at risk while you are sleeping but sleeping during the day will help you stay safer while it may be difficult to get used to sleeping while it s light out you are less likely to be a victim of crime or to be arrested during the daytime try a public park you can spread out your blanket as though you are on a picnic take a beach nap if you are near a beach consider sleeping there during the day you can fold your blanket like a beach towel so that you blend in with other sunbathers be careful to use your sunscreen and avoid the hottest parts of the day choose public places this is especially important if you choose to sleep at night while you may dislike having people see you sleep stay safe by choosing well lit high traffic locations where you are less likely to be a victim visit soup kitchens find a hot meal and possibly other services at soup kitchens which are commonly run by churches and charities soup kitchens also offer networking and outreach opportunities you can get to know other people who are living on the streets and may find someone who can help you better your circumstances 4 x research source if you can t find a soup kitchen try religious facilities which usually offer some type of charitable support you may be able to get a few grocery items or a store gift card ask the soup kitchen staff for information about related services programs that help the homeless and opportunities for assistance in getting off the streets but don t ask them to give you money or let you stay with them ask for food while you want to avoid walking up to people and soliciting them for help panhandling for food can keep you fed while you live on the streets people are often more willing to donate food than to give money get free samples if you are able to blend in with other customers go into grocery stores and collect the free samples don t take multiple samples from the same booth unless the person working the table gives you permission keep track of which store offers the most samples so that you can return there be sure to act like a customer it s a good idea to make a small purchase even if it s just a single piece of fruit or a pack of noodles visit farmer s markets after closing to see if you can get leftover produce for free or very cheap dumpster dive stores and restaurants throw out food every day and some of that food could be going into your stomach dumpster diving has become common because even people who can afford food choose to do it check the area around the dumpster so that you can avoid confrontations with people who may not want you to remove items from that dumpster such as a business owner or someone who already dives there when in doubt don t eat food that might have gone bad most chain grocery stores throw out extra food even before the best by date look in bins behind stores such as walmart kroger or safeway find out if dumpster diving is legal in your area and don t go into bins that are in gates prioritize proteins your diet will likely suffer when you re living on the streets but you can keep yourself in better health by making sure you get enough protein while you might not be able to get meat low cost options exist for example try peanut butter for cheap protein that doesn t need refrigeration beans are another great option though you may need to warm them 5 x research source keep lightweight snacks supplement your soup kitchen meals samples dumpster scores and donations by keeping a snack stash depending on how much money you can find or earn purchase or collect low cost non perishable food that you can carry in your bag try nuts trail mixes and nut butters which contain protein and fats you can also try dried foods like raisins beef jerky and granola bars that are light and often nutritious though they cost more remove packaging from food to make it less bulky and reduce weight look for snacks while you re dumpster diving they may be past their sell by date but they are usually still good for awhile collect free condiments that you can use in a pinch when other food is unavailable carry a water bottle water is more essential than food so keep a water bottle with you at all times fill up your water bottle every time you see a water fountain or clean sink even if it isn t empty while water is easily found in the city you don t want to risk being caught with an empty bottle because dehydration is one of your biggest risks if you aren t in a city then look for flowing water or catch rain water wash yourself in bathrooms public bathrooms are essential when you re living on the street aside from being a place to relieve yourself they offer you free running water soap and privacy while it s best to carry your own toiletries if you can t afford to buy soap or shampoo you can use the bathroom s hand soap 6 x research source look for available public bathrooms in places like fast food restaurants shopping centers airports libraries colleges and office buildings try turning a stall into a private wash station by bringing a container of water and mirror into the stall if you are able to purchase one you can acquire a collapsible bucket from an outdoor store this is a great option if you cannot find a private bathroom find a shower while most of your bathing will likely consist of bathroom sponge baths there are options for showering you can try shelters but you may be able to find a public shower that you can gain access to try visiting gyms or the ymca while you may have to pay gym fees you can ask if the gym offers free trials you may be able to take advantage of one of these options giving you access to the gym s facilities use the showers at a beach or campground while these showers may sometimes lack privacy they make washing yourself easier than it is in a sink act as though you belong and it s unlikely anyone will question you wash your clothes it s easier to clean yourself than it is to clean your clothes but keeping your clothes smelling good will keep more opportunities open to you because people are less likely to suspect that you are living on the streets while going to the laundromat weekly is best if that is impossible then you can wash your clothes in the sink check with your local shelter or soup kitchen to find out if they offer facilities for washing clothes collect change to use in the laundromat coin operated washers and dryers often cost between 1 1 25 wash your clothes in a bathroom sink a few pieces at a time then hang dry them try baking soda baking soda is cheap and can be used to keep both yourself and your clothes smelling better use it to wash your clothes and to deodorize your armpits and groin area you can even use baking soda as natural deodorant use the library public and university libraries are excellent resources for people living on the street you can use the computers access the internet apply for jobs read a book or magazine gain shelter and take advantage of the bathroom if you are interested in finding a steady job and housing the library can help you attain that 7 x research source travel light you don t want to alert people to the fact that you are living on the streets because they will make assumptions about you and are likely to want you to stay away from them this is especially important for if you are accessing stores office buildings and other facilities look for somewhere safe to stash extra items or reduce your possessions so that they easily fit into a backpack and tote 8 x research source when carrying a backpack try to look like you re either a hiking enthusiast or a bicyclist who carries a backpack for convenience try to use a bag that looks like a standard tote or reusable grocery bag so that people will assume that you are on your way home from shopping get a post office box while you will have to pay for it a post office box can be instrumental in helping you maintain a lifestyle or get back on your feet if that s your desire you can have mail sent to your post office box store small items in your box and use it as an address on job applications you may not be able to use it as an address to get services but some post office box options will provide you with a usable address so ask about your options 9 x research source be alert your safety depends on you being aware of your surroundings living on the streets can be dangerous especially since you can t always tell who to trust in addition to some people posing a threat to your safety people may assume that you are the threat be cautious and courteous stay with a group as the cliche says there is safety in numbers try to form partnerships with other people living on the streets so that you can keep each other safe living as a group will also allow you the option of keeping more possessions because you can take turns watching each other s stuff 10 x research source learn police patterns while the police usually mean security for a person living on the streets they can also be a threat because of prejudices against people on the streets you may be viewed as a criminal especially in certain neighborhoods know where they tend to patrol and use that information to make the best decisions about where to sleep and where to seek shelter 11 x research source depending on your area and race a police presence could make a place safer or less safe for sleeping if you have a good relationship with the police in your area then sleeping on their patrols could be a good option for you always be respectful when interacting with the police even if you feel you are being treated unfairly know your rights when you live on the streets you have to know the law well enough to protect yourself no matter what anyone says you still have rights for example in the u s you can legally hold up a sign asking for money in a public location because that falls under the first amendment on the flip side some cities do have laws and ordinances that address the homeless population so you need to check with local nonprofits to

if the blue wire was in connection b write b on the piece of tape and put the tape on the wire label or designate any wires that were loose and unconnected to your thermostat as well ignore the colors of wires except for your own identification purposes thermostats wired by non professionals do not usually adhere to codes so the colors may not match what they should keep the disconnected wires hanging out of the wall tie the wires together or tape them to the wall to keep them from falling back into the wall a lost wire will turn this rather easy process into quite the debacle pro tip wrap all the wires around a pencil the weight of the pencil is just enough to keep the wires from going anywhere install the replacement wall plate use the new wall plate as a template to mark where the holes you need to drill for the screws will be use a level if necessary then drill the holes and screw the replacement wall plate into its new position on the wall if your new thermostat has a mercury tube that is to say if your new thermostat is rather old school your device needs to be completely level or it won t render accurate readings using a level is very important in this scenario and is not just for aesthetic reasons make sure you re drilling holes that match the size of your screws a 3 16 drill bit is fairly standard your thermostat definitely comes with screws and probably comes with anchors make sure to use the anchors too they support the system on the wall hook up the thermostat to the wires use your notes or labels to re connect the wires to the thermostat or follow the pictures you took of the pre existing wiring you can twist the wires onto the thermostats connectors or follow the directions manual provided by the manufacturer your new thermostat should have the same corresponding code on the back unless otherwise noted in the instructions if you re at all in doubt contact a heating and cooling company some thermostats are as simple as a two wire system some have 5 if you have empty ports or connections don t worry your thermostat is most likely fine place the thermostat on the wall replace all wires back into the wall if extra length is exposed place the thermostat flush against the wall slightly above the wall plate slide it down so it catches the grooves or screws on the wall plate to sit in place if your thermostat isn t in a good location it s exposed to drafts or heat which can mess up the readings or it s too high or low for you you ll need to contact a professional to have wires moved activate the power back to the thermostat furnace and air conditioner switch on the proper switches in the breaker box to restore power give it a minute to kick on and don t forget to install the batteries most systems require 2 aa batteries to work make sure the batteries aren t old they re in place and the polarities are correct check to make sure your replacement thermostat is working set the thermostat so the furnace and the air conditioner will come on at different times give your furnace and air conditioner at least 5 minutes each time to activate if the thermostat does not work properly retrace your steps to see where you made a mistake you may need to hit the reset button on your new thermostat some will not start until this button is pushed program your thermostat each type of thermostat is different so read your manual if you have questions just remember that a programmable thermostat can save you loads of money have it be cooler when you re gone and warmer when you re there it ll turn off without you saving you money and saving energy to boot make sure your car has cooled down it won t be a good day if you singe off your eyebrows and get third degree burns on your hands so turn off your car and let it cool down before you open up the hood and get to work let it sit for at least an hour before you start dissecting its parts it s not a dumb idea to protect yourself with goggles or gloves either if you don t want anything getting in your eyes or your hands getting covered in gunk get out the protective gear and of course a shirt you don t mind smudging with grease or oil drain the antifreeze out of your car the thermostat and radiator hose are linked to your car s cooling system if you don t drain out the coolant you re gonna get water everywhere when you start disassembling here s how place a bucket or some sort of container underneath your radiator you ll have somewhere between 4 to 8 cups of fluid pouring out so don t skimp on the size of your container at the bottom of the radiator there should be a draining screw or cap technically it s a radiator drain cock twist this to the left opening it up let all the water and coolant flow out keep the cap somewhere you won t lose it locate your thermostat every model of car is different some thermostats you could spot from a mile away others will be an obstacle to even the most trained of eyes if looking at your car s engine is like reading gibberish find the radiator hose and follow it to the end that ll be where your thermostat is located the body of the thermostat is probably metal with a bit of gold in the center and possible a rubber ring around the edges it resembles a top or dreidel in shape and size or a small plunger if you re not quite sure what you re doing consult your manual or look up the location online it s better to know what you re looking for instead of poking around and possibly injuring yourself remove the radiator hose and take apart the thermostat casing the hose is most likely clamped to the thermostat casing unscrew this and set it aside move onto the thermostat casing exposing the thermostat itself you will definitely need a screwdriver and you may need pliers for the record most vehicles have a two bolt or three bolt system for the thermostat casing if corrosion and gunk is building up prominently clean up the area before you go about adding your new thermostat a bit of water will probably come out with removal of the hose this is normal if desired test your thermostat is it possible that your thermostat works it s just stuck closed or a different part of your vehicle is starting to kick the bucket affecting your thermostat s ability to make accurate readings if so it s very easy to test your thermostat here s how get a pot of water boiling insert your thermostat the thermostat should open at around 190 ºf 88 ºc since water boils at 212ºf 100ºc this is more than enough if the thermostat doesn t open in the water and then close when it cools you need a new one swap out your old thermostat for the new one from here on out it s mainly a matter of reassembly the easy stuff replace your thermostat just like it the old one was positioned if applicable replace the rubber ring too sealing the edges if the area is building up dirt and grime wipe it down with some cleaner first you want to maximize the life of your thermostat and not have to deal with this again anytime soon reassemble the system you remember what everything looked like right here s a brief checklist make sure the thermostat is snug and in place bolt down the thermostat casing over top of the thermostat finger start your bolt and then bust out your pliers or socket wrench and get to tightening be careful not to strip the bolts replace the radiator hose and clamp the radiator should be snug on the outside of the thermostat casing and the clamp must be well tightened replace the coolant and check for leaks if the coolant you just drained out was fairly new just use the same stuff in the bucket and add it back in if it was old you may be better off throwing the contents of the bucket out and just using new coolant either way replace the coolant and make sure the radiator drain cock is on tight once replaced check for leaks your car needs coolant to operate safely if yours is leaking you literally won t get very far get back on the roads you re done now all you have to do is keep an eye on your temperature gauge if it s acting up do a double check to make sure you secured everything appropriately if so you may need to consult a mechanic the problem probably lies elsewhere,Home-and-Garden
how to load a grease gun,grease guns are used to apply viscous lubricant onto moving mechanical parts used commonly in machine shops and garages properly lubricating moving metal parts helps to increase the service life of machines and avoid abrasions grease lubricant is applied with a grease gun available at most hardware and auto parts stores loading one can be a bit messy but uncomplicated whether you ve got a cartridge loader or a reservoir style grease gun,separate the grease gun head from the barrel if you have access to bulk grease in large containers grease guns can be loaded more efficiently to get started unscrew the head from the cap the head is the part with the handle and applicator tube attached unscrew the two pieces of the grease gun and separate them 1 x research source make sure that the handle on the back of the barrel which is the handle of the piston rod is fully depressed into the barrel or you risk sucking some grease through the gun during the process accidentally insert the open end of the barrel into a container of grease fill the barrel by holding the open end of the barrel down into the container of grease and slowly drawing back on the plunger rod to fill the reservoir pulling grease back into the barrel 2 x research source bulk grease containers are available at hardware stores and auto parts stores widely and are commonly used in garages in place of smaller cartridges if you re a serious mechanic this might be a good option for you remove the barrel from the grease when the plunger rod has been fully withdrawn lift the open end of the barrel out of the container of grease rotate the barrel to break it free from grease that may cling to the barrel use a cloth or rag to wipe excess grease from the end of the barrel 3 x research source reattach the barrel of the grease gun to the head of the grease gun different grease guns will work in slightly different ways for some it might be a matter of screwing the end cap on while others need the nozzle screwed on either way engage the threads and turn until the joint is fully seated 4 x research source test the dispensing of the grease press on the handle of the piston rod and squeeze the trigger of the grease gun until delivery of grease is seen at the end of the grease gun applicator tube wipe excess grease from the dispensing tip and the body of the grease gun use a cloth or rag to wipe the gun down and clean it to prepare for use 5 x research source unscrew the cartridge cap cartridge loaders are made of two basic parts the cartridge of grease itself housed in a similarly sized and shaped housing and the dispenser or nozzle from which the grease is extruded to remove the cartridge you ll basically just unscrew the cap that the cartridge is in by turning it clockwise while turning the dispenser nozzle counterclockwise it might be screwed on kind of tight so use some elbow grease 6 x research source pull back on the metal handle on the end of the barrel where the cartridge is held opposite the nozzle you should see a plunger rod that s used to push on the cartridge and force the grease out continue to pull until the plunger rod is withdrawn fully from the barrel 7 x research source on some grease guns pulling back should make the cartridge eject automatically depending on how much gunk is built up on the inside it may come out all or halfway before you remove it though you need to secure the rod in place secure the piston rod and remove the cartridge on most grease guns you should be able to move the piston rod sideways slightly into a slot in the barrel so that it cannot move forward on some grease guns the retracted piston rod will latch into the fully retracted position and a release tab is provided on the end of the barrel to allow the piston rod to move again 8 x research source when you ve secured the rod in place you can pull the empty cartridge loose and discard it prepare the new grease cartridge for loading cartridges are typically available at hardware and auto parts stores typical sizes are 14 oz 414 ml and 16 oz 473 ml cartridges before you load one in it s a good idea to clean up the gun slightly to get it ready for a new cartridge wipe the end of the barrel with a cloth or rag this will remove excess grease that may have leaked out during removal of the spent grease cartridge 9 x research source before inserting a new cartridge remove the plastic cap from one end of the new cartridge so the grease can flow out normally for lots of people storing grease cartridges upside down is a good way of getting it to settle on the right side near the nozzle if it hasn t been stored upside down shaking it hard once or twice toward the cap can help to settle it in the direction you want before inserting it insert the cartridge into the barrel insert the end of the cartridge that had the plastic cap on it first push it fully in so that the end of the cartridge seals with the end of the barrel remove the metal seal from the exposed end of the cartridge discard the metal seal 10 x research source reattach the barrel to the head of the grease gun screw it on part way two full rotations without screwing it down tightly release the piston rod from the retracted position and push it into the barrel while simultaneously pumping the handle of the grease gun nozzle this helps to work air through the mechanism and get the grease started stop when grease begins to appear at the dispensing head nozzle 11 x research source continue screwing together the head and barrel push on the piston rod to ensure that it is fully engaged in the replacement grease cartridge pump the handle make sure that grease is being delivered,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a school or workplace shooting,although unlikely a shooting can happen at any school or workplace it pays to be prepared and know in advance what creates the best chance for survival running should always be your first priority but be ready to hide or fight for your life if there is no safe escape route,run away whenever possible your best chance to survive the shooting is to get out of the area as fast as possible 1 x research source only rule this out if the only escape routes would put you in sight of the shooter know the escape routes prepare in advance by identifying all exits from the rooms where you spend the most time this includes emergency exits fire escapes and windows ideally plan at least two escape routes out of the school or workplace in case the shooter is blocking one of them 2 x research source don t rule out second story windows or windows that you would have to break you can survive cuts from broken glass or a broken leg from a fall 98 of shooters act alone if you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire you are usually safe do not pull the fire alarm even as an attempt to evacuate others the evacuation procedures for a fire and an active shooter are completely different and pulling the fire alarm can increase the risk of casualties as a result 3 x research source react immediately don t freeze up or waste time debating your options find an escape route and start running if you hear gunshots in the distance you can likely get out of the area before the shooter arrives if you have shoes that prevent you from running take them off forget your belongings if you ve determined that it s best to run then forget your wallet your purse or your cell phone though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you none of them are as important as your life run directly to the exit do not slow yourself down with evasive maneuvers such as running in a zig zag or bending over as you run run as fast as you can directly to safety these tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you and using a weapon with a low rate of fire getting away fast is usually the better option the one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit in this case running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance see the section on hiding for advice on finding cover that will stop a bullet bring people with you as you re running encourage others to run if someone looks disoriented or too scared to move grab that person and drag him with you tell the people that running is crucial to their survival if you re running in a bigger group it ll be harder to target you individually and you ll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter grab a weapon only if convenient if you happen to see a sharp object or a blunt object you can carry while running grab it do not waste time looking for one of these when you could be running this is only for a last case scenario when you are unable to escape the shooters if you have to fight close distance is your friend get as close as you can without being noticed grab the barrel with 1 hand and cover the ejection port with the other try to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction the shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire but only once because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round that weapon is now a useless hunk of metal until the shooter can clear and cycle another round in manually perfect opportunity for you to take the weapon away and subdue the shooter choose this course of action if running is impossible it should only take a few seconds to determine if running is a possibility if the shooter is rapidly approaching your room or if he is blocking the only escape route start hiding or barricading yourself in immediately hiding is the second option because it traps you in one area however most mass shooting events are over within ten or fifteen minutes if you can avoid the shooter for that long you have a good chance at surviving 4 x research source split tasks with other people in the room if there are other people in the room get their attention and assign them to the following tasks each described in more detail below one person should call 9 1 1 or the emergency number in your region one group of people should lock and barricade the door one group of people should grab anything that could be used as a weapon turn off the lights immediately turn off the lights in the room where you are this will make the shooter less likely to enter the room and slightly increase your chance of survival if he does lock and barricade the door lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up and they re not interested in taking the path of most resistance lock the door place a doorstop on it and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter if the shooter is approaching get away from the door as soon as you can stay away from all doors and windows if the door opens to the outside a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment building one may not be worth wasting time and blocking a potential escape route if you re in a bathroom that doesn t lock loop a belt or t shirt around the arms of the door butler the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open call emergency services a mass shooting typically continues for five minutes before anyone calls the police if you have other people in the room to barricade the door calling immediately can be a big help once they ve been called law enforcement typically arrives within three minutes 5 x research source use a landline instead of your cell phone if possible so the police can automatically trace the call if you can t reach an emergency service look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by holding a lighter underneath the detector this should automatically call the fire department grab any weapons you can find look around the room where you re hiding and find anything that you can use as a weapon it can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find on the teacher s desk the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office beakers or dangerous acids such as sulfuric acid in a science room or anything that is sharp heavy made of glass or which can be used as a weapon hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room where you are even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people work together while this is obviously a last resort anyone who can t find a weapon should grab something to throw 6 x research source find cover the term cover refers to barriers that will stop a bullet brick or concrete walls steel building support beams or thick trees are the most common examples if you are trapped in a single room your best option is a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet ideally find a spot that does not restrict your movement if the situation changes you want to be able to run to an exit as fast as possible find concealment if cover is not available concealment hides you from the shooter s line of sight but will not protect you from gunfire if it s your only option hide behind furniture in closets or in any other hiding spot crouch low to the ground to minimize the chance that a stray bullet hits you most interior walls will not stop a bullet turn off anything that makes noise if you have time silence your cell phone and other electronics so the sound won t encourage the shooter to approach you try to stay calm though this may seem nearly impossible it s crucial that you remain absolutely silent tell people that whimpering or crying will only make the shooter more likely to find you be mentally prepared for the event that the shooter comes into the room and finds you in that case you ll have no choice but to fight as described below play dead as a last resort people have survived mass shootings by playing dead in areas where shots have been fired 7 x research source however some shooters are aware of this tactic and will target bodies the only time you should try this is when both running and hiding are impossible remember that attacking the shooter is your final option you shouldn t jump out of your hiding place and attack the shooter if he s approaching you should only fight him if you re sure that you ll be shot if you do nothing do not try to reason with the shooter or plead for your life trying to engage with the shooter ask him what he s doing or to plead for your life by talking about your family has not been proven effective in dealing with shooters don t waste your time by trying to talk to him you re much better off fighting work with others to create confusion if you are in a group of people and cannot avoid the shooter your best chance is to create as much noise and movement as possible shouting throwing objects and running will buy you a few extra seconds to leave the room or to attack the shooter if there is no escape route attack the shooter with any weapon you can use scissors glass or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter as soon as you are in close proximity even a sharp ballpoint pen is better than nothing you re fighting for your life and every second counts once again this is an absolute last resort most shooters are heavily armed and some wear body armor even if you have a gun of your own you are most likely at a disadvantage aim high try to hurt the shooter in the face eyes shoulders or neck or arms so that they are more likely to let go of their weapon you should stab them in the neck gouge out their eyes or stab them in the arm doing anything you can to make them get rid of the weapon or to hurt them so the weapon is within your reach kick him in the crotch this is more effective if they are a man although it could still hurt distract and discourage a female shooter if you can t go for their face or weapon this will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain commit to the attack once you are in this situation hesitation or panic can be fatal be as aggressive as possible attacking with anything you can do not try to run or stop fighting even if you are shot in the leg or arm report any suspicious activity keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities if a student or co worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school report this to a teacher or law enforcement you may prevent a disaster by doing so many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately 8 x research source be aware of your school or workplace s lockdown procedure every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked where people should hide and how the authorities should be called so if you d like to be prepared for a shooting be familiar with your workplace s standard procedure when it comes to shootings unfortunately it may be difficult to follow the protocol exactly in the event of a shooting but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible be prepared for a shooting though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting if you d really like to be prepared you should take self defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident if you have no choice but to attack a shooter do not run to law enforcement the first people to arrive are there to locate and deal with the shooter not to rescue people do not leave a hiding spot and do not get in their way if you are wounded wait for a paramedic or firefighter keep your hands up when you are within sight of the police raise your hands and spread your fingers to show you are not a threat keep your hands visible at all times tell the police what you know if you have any information on the shooter s location or type of weaponry let the nearest officer know move in the direction the police came from don t stop to ask police for directions if it s safe to move run in the direction the police came from keeping your hands raised and visible obey police instructions immediately do so as fast as possible and without argument,Home-and-Garden
how to prune a schefflera plant,schefflera or umbrella plants are common houseplants that are easy to grow because they can thrive in artificial or moderately bright light conditions and are susceptible to few pests however they may require pruning if they get too large or scraggly 1 x research source here s how to prune your schefflera the process is really quite simple,examine your schefflera to see if it has a single stem or several stems this will influence how you go about pruning your plant schefflera with multiple stalks usually give you more options when pruning they can grow in fuller and bushier as they just have more places for leaves to grow schefflera with only one stalk may be more suitable for developing a tall thin plant keep the natural shape of your plant in mind when trimming fighting the natural growth pattern of your plant will be more difficult than simply shaping and trimming it as it grows this is especially important to look at when you are buying a new plant if you want a full bushy plant be sure to pick a schefflera that has multiple stems so it will fill in and expand outward and upward if you want a plant that will grow taller and stay relatively slim pick a schefflera with only one stem and trim any other stems that might pop out of the soil determine how you would like the plant to look immediately and in the future some people want a tall and skinny plant while others would like a short and bushy plant it all depends on where you would like your plant to live and how much care you can give it part of trimming a plant is deciding how you want it to grow and helping it along that path on a schefflera the growth nodes the place on a stem where new growth can develop are located at the point on the stems where the leaves sprout because the schefflera usually has abundant growth and many nodes at which to trim thinking about how it will grow in the future when assessing where that plant needs trimming will help you to promote growth in specific directions 2 x trustworthy source virginia cooperation extension publications and educational resources from virginia tech and virginia state university go to source make this decision before cutting any leaves have a plan before you start so that you avoid mistakes and trim too many leaves check the general condition of your plant before trimming your plant make sure that it is suitably potted and healthy make sure that your plant is in good soil and that the soil is moist before trimming your plant you may even want to take the opportunity to repot it if you suspect its roots are crowded and you want to promote growth you should also check to make sure the leaves are healthy if the leaves are looking discolored or getting brown spots you may need to address some problems either with over watering or a lack of nutrients in the soil schefflera should not be kept in super moist soil allow the soil to dry out between waterings if this does not improve the condition of the plant you may want to replace the soil it is potted in get your tools ready always be sure to use sharp and clean tools when pruning for schefflera plants the tools you ll need really depend on the plant and its size hand pruners shears and loppers will work for most small shrubs however schefflera can grow to be large as tall as 40 feet 12 2 m for larger plants you may need to use a pole pruner 3 x research source consider calling a professional pruning service if the tree is too large to handle safely with a pole pruner reduce the height of a schefflera plant by cutting an upright stem just above a growth node in other words trim it right above where a leaf has sprouted trimming off the growing tip of a stem will prevent it from quickly gaining height and will promote a fuller appearance in the area you cut use bypass type pruning shears the kind of pruning shears that cut with two blades just like scissors other types of shears have a tendency to crush stems as opposed to cutting cleanly through them 4 x research source sometimes unwanted height in a schefflera is caused by a lack of light the plant is basically growing up to try to find more light keep this in mind when finding a suitable place for it to live reduce the width of a schefflera by cutting any horizontal branches back to just above a leaf node keep in mind that you will get renewed growth at the node where you cut so you may want to cut the plant back further than you currently desire in anticipation of it filling in in the future schefflera can really handle some aggressive pruning so don t be afraid to give it a good haircut once again use bypass type pruning shears so that you do not crush the stem cut all stems down to 6 inches from the base to rejuvenate a bare bottomed straggly plant sometimes these plants get neglected and become horribly overgrown and if you cannot figure out a way to shape the plant through gentle pruning you can trim it all the way down this give your plant a fresh start and it will give you the opportunity to better control how it grows in the future don t worry it will grow back with a vengeance if it is given enough light moisture and nutrition when trimming your plant back make sure to leave 2 to 3 nodes on each stem this will give the plant ample spots at which to form new growth the large pieces you have cut off your plant would make great cuttings for propagating new plants place a cutting with at least two layers of leaves into moist soil for a few weeks this will give the cutting enough growth nodes to keep growing roots should sprout from the bottom of the cutting and the plant can then be repotted 5 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to calculate swimming pool volume in gallons,knowing how much water your pool will hold is the key to having the correct water chemistry sizing pumps filters and more if you want to be able to calculate your swimming pool volume in gallons all you have to do is follow a simple formula that is derived from your pool s shape if you want to know how to do it just follow these steps,measure the length and width of the pool if it s rectangle just measure the longest side and the shortest side of the pool if it s a square just measure one of the sides of the pool all four sides of the square will have the same length and if your pool is round just measure the diameter of the pool which is the longest path that can travel through the center of the circle from one edge to the other 1 x research source measure the depth of your pool this is the other dimension that is crucial to knowing the volume of your pool if your pool has the same depth throughout most above ground pools are structured this way for example then you ll just have to take one measurement from the top to the bottom of the pool but if like most pools your pool has depth that gradually increases then you ll have to measure the minimum depth the shallow end and the maximum depth the deep end of the pool 2 x research source find the average depth of the pool to do this you need to write down the measurements of the deep end and the shallow end of the pool and divide the result by two let s say the shallow end of the pool measures 3 feet and the deep end measures 8 feet 3 8 2 5 5 the average depth of the pool is 5 5 feet 3 x research source multiply the result by the length and width of the pool now just take this number and multiply it by the length and width of the pool you re really just multiplying the area of the bottom of the pool by its depth let s say that the width of the pool is 20 feet and the length is 40 feet so 5 5 x 40 x 20 4 400 cubic feet 4 x research source convert the answer to gallons to convert the answer to gallons simply multiply the answer by 7 48 4 400 x 7 48 32 912 gallons of water you re all done 5 x research source calculate the volume of the pool as if it were a cylinder if you have a round pool that is of uniform depth then all you have to do to find the volume is to treat it like a cylinder to find the volume of a cylinder all you have to do is find the area of the circular base times the height this uses the formula v πr2h let s say the pool s radius is 4 5 feet and its depth height is 4 feet plug those numbers into the formula to find the volume v π x 4 52 x 4 254 46 cubic feet to convert this to gallons simply multiply the result by 7 48 254 46 x 7 48 1903 gallons 6 x research source use the shorthand formula for finding the volume of a round pool for faster but slightly less accurate results you can also plug the depth and diameter of the pool into the following formula v depth x diameter squared x 5 9 let s say we re working with the same circle that has a depth of 4 and a diameter of 9 the same as having a radius of 4 5 the volume of this pool 4 x 9 x 9 x 5 9 1 911 gallons the result is slightly larger 7 x research source adjust the formula if your pool does not have the same depth if your pool is shallower on one end and deeper on the other just measure the minimum height and maximum height of the pool and divide them by 2 to get the average height or the depth you should use in either formula for example if the pool has a minimum depth of 5 feet and a maximum depth of 10 feet then you can add 5 10 to get 15 and divide 15 by 2 to get 7 5 the average depth of the pool you can use this as the depth of the pool in either formula 8 x research source find the average depth of the pool simply find the minimum depth and the maximum depth of the pool and divide the result by 2 let s say the shallow end of the pool measures 3 feet and the deep end measures 8 feet 3 8 2 5 5 the average depth of the pool is 5 5 feet find the average width of the pool now just find the average of all the widths of the pool by adding up the different widths and dividing by the amount of widths let s say you re working with a pool that has three widths 20 15 and 20 so add them up and divide by 3 20 15 20 55 55 3 18 3 feet the average width of the pool is 18 3 feet find the length of the pool let s say the length of the pool is 40 feet multiply the average depth the average width and the length of the pool so 5 5 feet x 18 3 feet x 40 feet 4 026 cubic feet multiply the result by 7 48 to get the answer in gallons 4 026 cubic feet x 7 48 30 114 gallons,Home-and-Garden
how to survive an apocalypse,what will happen if society collapses what would you do if there s no one to help you or your family disaster preparedness is more than worrying it s also about being practical preparing for realistic scenarios and being ready for the unpredictable an apocalypse is unlikely but you ll need to know what to do in case it happens,gather sufficient supplies to survive for 90 days surviving after a major apocalyptic event is not going to be short term since the entire country or the world is likely to be falling apart there are no two ways around that reality however hopefully having three months of supplies will get you settled and going with your new self sufficient habits the more time you have dedicated to forming a plan when disaster does strike the

friends using a radio keep batteries with your radio the last thing you want is to presume you re prepared when you re really not and if you have a loved one you re taking care of make sure they have a radio and you re not keeping both of them for the two of you when all else fails work out how you will contact each other this is when your permanent markers will come in handy if the apocalypse strikes and you have left the house write down where you are going when you left and if when you ll be back on the wall on a rock on a nearby car wherever you can find use diesel powered vehicles hoarding gasoline won t work the chemicals that once kept it fresh will degrade it in time after a year or so it goes bad chances are gas stations will run out of gasoline but there could be some diesel left in addition all military diesels can run on other fuels as well from rotten kerosene to fermented leaves so invest in something that can handle the harder fuels 4 x research source in said vehicle it s equally as likely that you ll be in it when all breaks loose so pack a survival kit to keep in your car as well is there such a thing as being too prepared if this isn t an option make sure you have a bicycle laying around somewhere that s fully functioning there will be a point when you need to cover large distances in a short amount of time become a good shot depending on the circumstances surrounding the apocalypse knowing how to handle a gun can mean the difference between life and death particularly if you ll need to hunt or defend your home against violence 5 x research source if it s legal to do so where you live it might be a good idea to purchase a gun ahead of time and become proficient at using it be sure to exercise gun safety at all times for starters always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction unload the gun when not in use always treat a gun as though it is loaded even when you know it isn t keep the gun where children cannot access it be sure of your target and what lies beyond it and regularly have the gun serviced by a firearms professional 6 x research source regardless of who or what you ll be facing this is probably a good idea anything menacing needs to be kept far far away whatever or whoever your enemy shooting them will probably increase your chances of not being attacked or eaten unless the apocalypse is due to some bacteria that s floating around in the air in that case get a gas mask the people zombies menacing forces will probably still see you as an enemy learn how to hunt master the art of the snare trap if you re really scrappy with it you need nothing but what nature provides you if you re on the ocean or near a body of water get to fishing or fly fishing your stock of baked beans and spaghetti o s

but earbuds on and iphone in hand how else would you be reading this you re going to want to put on some layers even if the meteor looming on the horizon will send a blast of heat from here to fargo you ll be glad you did 9 x research source pretty much any cause for an apocalypse requires long comfortable clothing you want a long sleeved shirt and pants to protect your skin from predators yes but also from the sun and treacherous terrain the apocalypse is no time to work on your tan if you have time grab a pair of boots if you don t have boots nearby go for tennis shoes you may have to break into a dead sprint at any time if you have the luxury make sure you re comfortable enough in your clothes and shoes to flee come up with an escape plan if for some odd reason your house isn t safe to stay in you ll need to get out as soon as possible with your map in hand get out and get out now would you do best in the forest near water are you concerned with privacy and hiding from others or is there not another soul in sight your specific situation will determine where you should go again if you can stay in your house do so a shelter is best and friends and family will know how to find you make an assessment of your situation be as logical and rational as possible you may want to stay but is it best for you and your family seek shelter even if it s not nuclear you ll be better off escaping the perils of weather and being exposed to predators by getting and staying inside but if it s a blast that is putting down the human race it s doubly imperative that you shield yourself from the radiation as quickly as you can 10 x research source basements are a good place to start 16 inches 40 6 cm of solid brick can keep radiation away from you so you should fairly set there not to mention among your own things one inch 2 5cm of steel will do it too but you probably don t live on the enterprise find a food source you ll probably want this to be from a remnant of your soon to be past and not a raspberry bush or particularly lively pond a grocery store or even recently deserted houses are your best bet as you re scrounging get a candy bar and chow it down the last thing you want to think about right now is hunger and stock up don t think in terms of days think in weeks grab a few bags and start scrumping what can you carry that ll last the longest think in volume and weight in addition to preservation cans are good but they re heavy but if everything is already picked over don t get fussy take what you can get you ll need just anything to survive water get loads and loads and loads of water or else you ll be drinking your pee in no time go on the defensive it s safe to assume at this juncture that whatever is out there is not your friend find a weapon that you can actually use and start watching your six when it comes to humans there is no place for intelligence and culture now you do what you need to do 11 x research source don t flash your gun like you do your bmw conceal your weapons you know that scene in die hard where bruce had those guns taped to his back despite the fact that tape doesn t adhere easily to pools of sweat and pulled a one over on that german villain either played by jeremy irons or alan rickman that s going to be you no one s going to pull the wool over your eyes you re a weapon yourself find other survivors you ve got your food you ve got your weapons and you ve staked out a place to stay now it s time to assemble a team a la the walking dead except that you want a team that is actually useful when you consider taking on others they re mouths to feed after all assess what they can do for you do they know plants are they a wizard with a javelin are they carrying their own stockpile of food okay you ll probably want friends so you shouldn t be too picky if you re not going to assess them for their goods at least consider their character does your gut tell you they re trustworthy if you re all alone keep a look out for lights and fires at nighttime if you see one or more consider venturing out yourself to make new best friends but only if you think the end would justify the means how far away is the light how quickly could you get there what would you be risking by leaving are there predators or obstacles in your path you may be better off being alone for now stay positive this will arguably be the hardest thing especially if you re alone or wounded but ultimately this hardship will be easier to handle if you remain optimistic about it and if there are children with you all the more reason 12 x research source do not let your ethics stand in the way of your identity the rules are different now just because you decided someone isn t pulling their slack and the team should therefore cut their losses doesn t mean you ve turned into an animal assess your moralities as you see fit but understand that the world is a much different place now and you must adapt to it to stay

how to get iron stains out of fabric,if you ve scorched your favorite shirt with a clothing iron don t worry as long as the burn mark isn t severe you should be able to remove it completely with peroxide white vinegar or oxygen bleach if you re dealing with rust stains caused by iron on a piece of fabric you can mix natural ingredients like lemon juice or white vinegar with table salt to create a stain removing paste,dampen a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide if the fabric is white hydrogen peroxide is very effective at removing stains on white fabrics like cotton but unfortunately it can bleach or ruin colored fabrics if you have stained white fabric wet a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide 1 x research source you could also use a clean white rag to apply the peroxide regardless of the fabric s color if the fabric is melted or the burn is completely black you probably won t be able to get the scorch marks out 2 x research source dab the hydrogen peroxide onto the stain and let it sit for 1 minute gently press the cotton ball into the fabric until the stained area is thoroughly soaked with hydrogen peroxide allow the hydrogen peroxide to penetrate the stain for about 60 seconds so it can get deep into the fibers 3 x research source rinse the peroxide out thoroughly with water and repeat if needed bring the fabric to your sink and rinse the stained area out thoroughly it s important to remove all of the hydrogen peroxide from the material since the residue can weaken the fibers of the fabric over time 4 x research source if the stain persists after you rinse the fabric thoroughly you can repeat this process as many times as you need to if the stain is gone launder the item as you normally would dampen a white cloth with white vinegar if the stain is on colored fabric for scorch marks on colored fabric distilled white vinegar is your best bet lightly wet a clean white cloth with distilled white vinegar 5 x research source the white cloth allows you to see if the vinegar is actually lifting the stain off the fabric keep in mind that melted fabric can t be fixed and black scorch marks probably can t be removed dab at the stain with the white cloth until the stain lifts off the fabric gently press the vinegar soaked cloth into the stain and lift it up again keep dabbing stopping periodically to make sure the scorch color is transferring from the fabric to your white cloth stop once the stain is fully lifted 6 x research source scrubbing may force the stain deeper into the fibers and make the stain worse so dab gently the cloth helps to physically lift the stain off the fabric which makes the technique more effective than just soaking the item in vinegar you may need to switch to a different area of the cloth if the first area gets covered in the stain rinse the fabric thoroughly with water to remove the vinegar hold the fabric under cold or lukewarm water and rinse out the white vinegar thoroughly once the vinegar is gone you can pop the fabric into the washing machine and clean it as usual 7 x research source if these techniques don t work try soaking the item in oxygen bleach to remove the stain fill a tub or large container with warm water if your sink basin is clean you can plug the drain and use that if you don t have a tub or container handy fill the container with enough warm water to fully submerge your stained fabric 8 x research source mix a small amount of color safe oxygen bleach into the warm water check the oxygen bleach s packaging for specific instructions on how much to use then measure out the powdered bleach and add it to the warm water 9 x research source use a wooden spoon to gently swirl the water and bleach together submerge the stained fabric in the cleaning solution overnight plunge the fabric into the cleaning solution so that it s fully submerged then leave the fabric to soak for about 8 hours or overnight 10 x research source run the fabric through a normal wash cycle to remove a lingering stain after soaking the fabric overnight pop it into your washing machine and wash the item as you normally would pull out the fabric after the cycle finishes and examine it to make sure the stain is gone 11 x research source if the stain is gone you can put the item in the dryer don t put the fabric into the dryer until the stain is completely gone or the stain may never come out if the stain lingers you can repeat the soaking and washing process again mix equal parts of salt and white vinegar to make a paste pour enough salt to adequately cover the stain into a mixing bowl add about the same amount of distilled white vinegar to the bowl and stir the ingredients until the mixture becomes a thick paste 12 x research source for example if your stain is 1 inch 2 5 cm in diameter you ll probably need to use about 1 tablespoon 17 grams of salt regular white table salt works fine for this add more vinegar or salt if you need to adjust the consistency use a toothbrush to cover the stain with a thick layer of the paste spread the fabric out flat on a solid surface with the stained area facing up pick up some of the paste on the bristles of an old toothbrush then brush the paste onto the stain in a thick layer keep picking up and applying more paste as needed until the rust stain is completely covered 13 x research source for tough stains gently rub the paste into the stain with the toothbrush so the mixture gets down into the fabric s fibers the salt and vinegar paste works on carpet too 14 x research source let the paste penetrate the stained fabric for 30 minutes since your fabric is already spread out flat on a sturdy surface you can just leave it sitting where it is after half an hour push a little of the paste to the side and see if the paste fully removed the stain 15 x research source if the stain is gone launder the item like you normally would 16 x research source if you walk away at any point make sure the fabric and paste won t be disturbed by any pets or kids create a mixture of equal parts lemon juice and salt if the stain persists if the first paste didn t get rid of the stain completely don t worry mix a tougher cleaning solution in a separate bowl using equal parts lemon juice and salt 17 x research source you can squeeze a fresh lemon for the juice or use a bottle of store bought lemon juice for this cover the stained area thoroughly with the new paste mixture use your trusty old toothbrush to apply a thick layer of the new paste onto stain be sure to cover stain completely in the mixture if you d like you can gently scrub the mixture into the fabric fibers with the toothbrush bristles 18 x research source lay the fabric out flat in a sunny spot and leave it until the paste dries bring the stained fabric outside and spread it out flat on a clean surface with the stained side facing up let the fabric sit in the sun until the paste dries and hardens 19 x research source it may take 2 3 hours for the paste to harden and lift the stain 20 x research source choose a bright sunny area because the heat of the sun makes the paste more effective rinse the paste off of the fabric with water hold the fabric under your sink s tap and rinse away the hardened paste with warm or cool water if the stain is gone go ahead and launder the item as you normally would if the stain is still there you can repeat the process 21 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to find wall thickness of a pipe,a pipe s wall thickness is typically used to determine its strength or how much pressure it can handle you can find the wall thickness of a pipe by measuring an open pipe s inner and outer diameters manually or you can use a special tool called an ultrasonic thickness gauge to automatically get a wall thickness measurement for any pipe even if it s already installed whichever method you choose measuring a pipe s wall thickness should only take a couple of minutes,use a tape measure or ruler to measure the inside diameter of the pipe place your chosen measuring tool across the center of the pipe s inside opening read the distance between the inside edge of one wall to the inside edge of the opposite wall to get the inside diameter 1 x research source make sure your ruler or tape measure is passing through the exact middle of the pipe so that the inside edges of the wall are exactly opposite from each other in other words you are measuring the furthest distance across the hollow inside of the pipe measure using centimeters and millimeters to get the most precise measurement pipe wall thicknesses are usually measured using the metric system you can use inches if you prefer measure the outside diameter of the pipe using your measuring tool put your ruler or tape measure across the middle of the pipe s opening read the distance between the outside edge of one wall to the outside edge of the opposite wall to find the outside diameter 2 x research source in this step you re measuring the furthest distance across the pipe s opening but from the outside of the walls instead of inside the walls subtract the inside diameter from the outside diameter subtract the first number you got or the smaller number from the second number you got or the bigger number the difference between them is the thickness of the opposite walls combined 3 x research source for example if the outer diameter is 2 in 5 1 cm and the inner diameter is 1 8 in 4 6 cm subtract 1 8 in 4 6 cm from 2 in 5 1 cm to get 0 2 in 0 51 cm you can do this calculation in your head or by using a calculator divide the number you got by 2 to get the wall thickness take the number you got by subtracting the inner diameter from the outer diameter and divide it by 2 to cut it in half the number you are left with is the pipe s wall thickness 4 x research source for example if you got 0 2 in 0 51 cm by subtracting the inner diameter from the outer diameter divide 0 2 in 0 51 cm by 2 to get a pipe wall thickness of 0 1 in 0 25 cm turn on the thickness gauge by pressing the power button press and hold the power button release the power button when you see digits appear on the gauge s display 5 x research source an ultrasonic thickness gauge bounces high frequency soundwaves through a surface to calculate the thickness of a material you can purchase one of these gauges online for under 100 usd most ultrasonic thickness gauges work pretty much the same way so you can apply this method to any make or model press the cal button to start calibrating the gauge press and hold the button until the screen displays cal this begins the gauge s automatic calibration process 6 x research source most thickness gauges have a cal button but some might have an image of an old fashioned balance instead you can always refer to your gauge s owner s manual if your machine looks different and you aren t sure how to calibrate it put a dime sized bead of ultrasound couplant gel on the sensor head open up a bottle of ultrasonic thickness gauge couplant gel and squeeze a generous dollop out onto the gauge s sensor head this gel facilitates the transmission of sound waves between the machine and the material you are measuring 7 x research source the gauge s sensor head is the round head attached to the machine s cable it looks kind of like a medical stethoscope you can thickness gauge couplant gel sometimes called coupling gel or transmission gel online for about 15 usd or less place the sensor against the calibration chip and wait for the gauge to calibrate press the sensor head flat against the calibration chip and hold it there steadily wait until the numbers on the machine s screen stop changing 8 x research source every ultrasonic thickness gauge comes with a calibration chip that weighs a certain amount the machine knows this number and will automatically calibrate itself to read the correct weight hold the sensor head against a pipe to measure the wall thickness add another dime sized dollop of couplant gel to the sensor head place the sensor against the outside wall of a pipe and hold it there until the numbers on the screen stop changing the number the screen settles on is the wall thickness of the pipe in centimeters 9 x research source for example if the numbers on the screen stop changing at 0 7 the pipe s wall thickness is 0 7 cm 0 28 in pipe wall thickness is usually measured using the metric system in other words centimeters and millimeters however thickness gauges also have an option to measure in inches,Home-and-Garden
how to test a himalayan salt lamp,imagine yourself relaxing at the spa or meditating in a serene nook why not create those experiences at home with your very own himalayan salt lamp you ve probably heard that himalayan salt lamps have lots of health benefits while there s little scientific evidence to back up those claims you ll probably find the rosy glow of the lamp relaxing 1 x research source however imitation salt lamps do exist so make sure you re buying the real thing,check for pakistan as the country of origin real himalayan salt lamps originate from the himalayan mountain range which spans across pakistan india bhutan and nepal in most cases the salt used for lamps is mined in the khewra salt mine in pakistan look on the lamp s label or the box it comes in to find its country of origin if it s not from pakistan it may not be a real lamp 2 x research source some lamps may be assembled in other countries with salt from pakistan if this is the case double check that the package says the salt is sourced from pakistan make sure the salt looks pink or orange real himalayan salt contains minerals that make it look pink or orange in color it s totally normal for the color to vary across the salt since the minerals are present in different amounts when the lamp is turned on check for a rosy glow 3 x research source while white himalayan salt lamps do exist they re usually pretty expensive if you find an affordable white salt lamp it s likely not real himalayan salt 4 x research source look for a dim glow rather than a bright light when the lamp is on real himalayan salt is dense so light barely passes through it this creates a dull hazy glow turn the lamp on to see how brightly it shines if the lamp you re looking at illuminates as well as a regular lamp it s likely not real himalayan salt 5 x research source himalayan salt lamps are better for mood lighting they re not going to increase the brightness in your home pick up the lamp to make sure it feels heavy salt chunks are dense so they re usually quite heavy always lift your lamp from the base so you don t accidentally damage the salt block hold the lamp in your hand to get a feel for its weight a real lamp should be heavy 6 x research source a fake himalayan salt lamp may still be heavy however if the lamp is lightweight this might be a sign it s not real check for a puddle of water under the lamp if it s been off for a while himalayan salt lamps naturally attract water so you may notice the salt sweating water and possibly clumps of salt will drain down the salt block and will pool under the lamp check for water on or around a salt lamp if it s been off for awhile 7 x research source you ll notice more water if you live in a humid environment turning on the lamp helps keep it dry so a lamp in regular use may not sweat wipe the salt block with a damp cloth to see if any salt comes off since water dissolves salt a damp cloth will dissolve some of the salt from a real lamp wet a paper towel or a rag with warm water then swipe the cloth over the side of the lamp check the cloth to see if there s salt or a pink stain which is a sign that your lamp may be real 8 x research source a fake salt lamp likely won t melt if you can t seem to wipe away any of the salt the lamp may not be real scrape the surface to see if the salt crumbles easily salt is fragile so a real himalayan salt lamp is easy to damage durability is a sure sign your lamp is fake to see if your lamp is real salt use a pair of tweezers to gently chip off some of the salt if you can t scrape off any salt the lamp may be a fake 9 x research source don t do this test unless the lamp belongs to you choose a spot that already looks craggy or uneven so it won t be noticeable that you chipped off the salt lick the lamp to see if it tastes like salt himalayan salt tastes similar to regular salt and is often used to season food before you lick the lamp wipe it with a damp cloth to remove the top layer of salt and any dust that s settled on the lamp then touch your tongue to the lamp to check the taste 10 x research source if your lamp doesn t taste like salt it s likely not a real himalayan salt lamp experiment with your lamp to see if it relaxes you while there s no evidence that himalayan salt lamps provide health benefits they re still a lovely addition to your home and may make you feel better a salt lamp can create a spa like atmosphere in your home that can be very relaxing place your lamp in a spot where you can enjoy it on a regular basis 11 x research source you might keep your lamp on your bedside table so you can enjoy the low light before bed if you meditate or do yoga you might keep your lamp in your meditation area if you work from home you could place your lamp in your work space track your mood to see if the warm glow helps you feel better you may want a himalayan salt lamp because you ve heard they can help relieve anxiety and depression while there s little scientific evidence to back up these claims it s possible the lamp may work for you since the lamp gives off a warm glow you might find it improves your mood monitor your mood while you re using the lamp and afterwards to see if it helps you 12 x research source keep in mind that a himalayan salt lamp isn t a replacement for treatment if you re struggling with anxiety or depression it s best to talk to your doctor about what treatment options might be right for you see if the low light from the lamp helps you wind down before bed you might have seen reports that himalayan salt lamps help you sleep but there s no evidence to support those claims however the low light from the salt lamps might help you fall asleep faster if you turn off other lights and screens 13 x research source blue light from your phone tablet or tv can keep you awake longer 14 x trustworthy source harvard medical school harvard medical school s educational site for the public go to source you might try relaxing with your himalayan salt lamp instead for instance you could turn on your lamp and meditate for 15 to 30 minutes before bed this might actually help you fall asleep faster 15 x trustworthy source

how to clean a burnt waffle maker,while they aren t a kitchen necessity waffle makers can make any sunday morning breakfast faster and easier cleaning a waffle maker however can be tough especially when burnt bits of batter get stuck in the grooves fortunately you can scrub your waffle maker and soak the burnt pieces off for an easy cleanup dry your waffle maker thoroughly and store it upright to keep enjoying homemade waffles time and time again,unplug the waffle maker and let it cool down if you were recently using your waffle maker make sure you turn it off and unplug it then wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down fully so you don t burn your hands 1 x research source waffle makers get really hot when you use them which is why you need to let them cool off for a bit brush off any crumbs with a paper towel grab a paper towel or a soft bristled brush and use it to wipe away any large crumbs or burnt areas this is just an initial wipe down so you don t have to work very hard at it 2 x research source if your waffle maker has removable plates you can pop them out before you start cleaning to make it easier never use a steel scrubber on your waffle maker as it can damage the surface of the plates soak up the excess oil with a few paper towels fold a paper towel in half and crease the fold so it stays use the edge of the paper towel to dig into the crevices of the waffle maker and wipe up any leftover oil 3 x research source this can also help to loosen up any stuck bits of burnt batter mix hydrogen peroxide and baking soda together to form a paste pour a 1 1 ratio of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda into a bowl then mix them together until they form a lumpy paste the mixture may foam up a bit as you stir it but that just means it s working 4 x research source hydrogen peroxide is a foaming agent and baking soda is mildly abrasive so they both work to remove tough stuck on clumps of batter spread the paste onto the grates and let it sit for 2 hours use a spoon to spread the paste onto the waffle maker focusing on the areas that have burnt pieces of batter on them set a timer for about 2 hours to let the mixture loosen and absorb the burnt particles 5 x research source the paste will start to turn brown as it absorbs the oil and crumbs from your waffle maker wipe the paste off the waffle maker with a clean towel use a new clean rag to gently wipe the hydrogen peroxide and baking soda off your waffle maker if there are any stubborn stuck on spots you can use the rag to scrub them off as much as you can 6 x research source even if the paste didn t take off all of the burnt batter it will have loosened it enough that you can clean it off easily scrape the crevices of the waffle iron with a paper towel fold another paper towel and use the creased edge to get in between the crevices of the waffle iron try to use the corner of the paper towel to scrape off as much gunk as you can 7 x research source if there are any really hard to get spots grab a toothpick and use that to scrape out the grooves again you should never use a steel brush or scrubber on your waffle maker as it can scratch the plates dry the waffle maker with a clean towel grab a clean dry towel and use it to wipe off any excess water from the waffle maker leave the waffle maker open to dry before you close it and store it upright on a shelf 8 x research source if you were cleaning a waffle iron with detachable plates dry them off before you snap them back into the waffle maker unplug the waffle maker and let it cool for 30 minutes when you re done making waffles turn your waffle maker off and let it sit for 30 minutes or until it s fully cool try not to let it sit for much longer than that or it could make it harder to clean in the long run 9 x research source if the waffle maker is too hot you could burn your hands if you let the waffle maker sit for too long the batter could get stuck on the grates and be difficult to remove wipe off your waffle maker with soap and a soft bristled brush put a few drops of dish soap on a soft bristled brush and use it to wipe away any leftover oil or batter try to scrub in between the grooves of your waffle maker to really wipe out any leftover pieces 10 x research source using dish soap on a cast iron waffle maker can wipe away the seasoning if you don t want to remove the seasoning from your waffle maker skip the soap and just use water if your waffle maker plates are removable you can pop them out and take them over to the sink use a waffle maker iron brush to scrub off burnt bits an iron brush is a hard bristled brush that can be used on cast iron without scratching it use one of these brushes to scrub off any burnt pieces of batter that are stuck in the grooves of your waffle maker 11 x research source if you got all of the burnt bits off during your first scrub you don t have to use a stronger brush dry the plates with a towel try to get in between the grooves with a towel to get rid of the majority of the water then lay the plates out to dry for about 1 hour storing wet cast iron plates can cause rust and might shorten the lifespan of your waffle maker 12 x research source coat the plates in butter or oil to season them if you d like to spread a small drop of vegetable oil or butter onto a paper towel rub the paper towel into the plates of the waffle maker to season them and add a bit of flavor to your next batch of waffles pat up the excess butter or oil with a separate paper towel before you store your waffle maker 13 x research source seasoning your waffle maker will make your waffles taste better in the future adding butter or oil also helps moisturize the cast iron plates to keep them from drying out,Home-and-Garden
how to cover bad wallpaper,moving into a new place is really exciting discovering old or bad wallpaper though not so much removing wallpaper can take a long time and it may not be an option for you if you re renting fortunately you can cover your wallpaper with a new coat of paint or use a less permanent solution with wall decorations either way it will help you make your home feel like a home again so you can enjoy your new space,repair missing sections of wallpaper with wallpaper paste grab some wallpaper paste and use it to reapply any ripped or torn pieces of wallpaper to the wall if any sections of the wallpaper are missing completely buy new wallpaper and cover the bare areas this may seem counterintuitive but you need a smooth even base to paint over 1 x research source if you re patching bare areas try to get wallpaper in the same color scheme as the one that s on your wall currently spackle the seams of the wallpaper grab a putty knife and a bucket of spackling paste from the hardware store pick up a glob of spackle with the putty knife then gently swipe it onto the seams of the wallpaper in a downward motion use the spackle on every seam in the wallpaper to create a smooth even base 2 x research source try to make the spackle as smooth as possible on the first application so you don t have to spend as long sanding it down you can also use the spackle to fill any holes in the wall sand the spackle down once it s dry after about 1 hour grab some 60 grit sandpaper and work on smoothing out the spackle so it s even with the rest of the wall wear a dust filtering mask while you do this to avoid inhaling any dust particles from the spackle as you work 3 x research source if you have an electric sander you can use that instead if you filled in any holes you ll probably need to sand down the edges of the patch sanding creates a lot of dust if your walls are covered in white dust use a damp towel to wipe them down before you paint prep the wallpaper with a coat of oil based primer use an oil based white primer to coat the wallpaper completely with a large paint brush or roller make sure you work in a well ventilated room or put on a filtering mask to keep your lungs safe while using this product let the primer dry for about 30 minutes before you move on 4 x research source make sure you use an oil based not water based primer water based primers can ruin the wallpaper making it hard to paint over paint an oil based paint color on the wall pick out the color that you want to use on your wallpaper and apply the first coat using a paint roller darker colors will be easier to use since they ll cover the wallpaper faster but you can choose any color that you d like to 5 x research source again you should use an oil based paint not a water based one for an even smooth application paint on a second coat to cover any patchy spots once the first layer of paint has dried go in again with the same color around the entire wall focus on any areas that look patchy or uneven for a seamless looking wall 6 x research source if you re using a super light color like yellow or cream you may need a third coat prime the wallpaper with an oil based primer use a can of white oil based primer to cover over all of your wallpaper for an even base coat let the primer dry for about 1 day before you move on 7 x research source if there are any holes in the wall fill those in before you use primer for an even surface you don t have to worry about making the primer look nice since it s just providing a base coat add water to joint compound until it looks like pancake batter pour out 1 bucket of joint compound or drywall mud into a paint roller pan add 1 c 240 ml of water and stir it into the compound with a paint stirrer keep adding water until the mixture looks smooth and slightly runny but not so watery that you can t smooth it onto a paint brush 8 x research source read the instructions on the back of the joint compound before you start using it you can find joint compound at most hardware stores smooth the joint compound onto the wall with a drywall trowel use a thin flat drywall trowel to pick up a clump of the joint compound start from the top of the wall and use your trowel to smooth the mixture downward coating the entire wall keep picking up more joint compound and smoothing it from the top down until your entire wall is covered 9 x research source try working in 3 by 3 ft 0 91 by 0 91 m areas so you can make sure your drywall mud is smooth the smoother you apply it the first time the less work you ll have to do later on for small areas use a putty knife instead of a drywall trowel leave the mud to dry for about 1 day the drywall mud will become solid and white as it dries to speed up the drying process point a few fans at the wall to dry it out faster 10 x research source you can also open up any doors and windows to give the room some air flow and speed up the drying process sand the mud down with sandpaper until it s smooth using a 60 grit sandpaper rub down the drywall mud until the wall is level and even all throughout focus on spots around door frames and electrical outlets to ensure you get a smooth even surface 11 x research source try wrapping a piece of sandpaper around a wooden block and stapling it in place to make your sanding easier if you have an electric sander you can use that apply another coat of joint compound if you need to if you notice your wallpaper peeking through the drywall mud or it looks uneven in some places use your drywall trowel again to smooth on more of the joint compound leave it to dry then sand it down until it s even 12 x research source once your drywall mud layers are dry you can paint your wall like normal hang up a tapestry to hide most of the wall pick out a tapestry made of fabric that spans across your entire wall use push pins on all 4 corners to cover up the wallpaper and keep it hidden behind a fresh new design 13 x research source you can find tapestries in all colors and sizes at most home goods or art stores try hanging sheets sheets of fabric to create a new wall color measure the height and width of your wall then go to a fabric store and pick out a length of fabric with your wall s dimensions use push pins on every corner to hang the fabric up and create a brand new wall 14 x research source try to pick thin fabric like cotton or organza so your fabric stays put on the wall install a curtain rod at the top of the wall to hide it with curtains measure the length of your wall and purchase a curtain rod at least that long using screws mount the rod holders on either side of your wall then thread 2 to 3 long curtains on the curtain rod extend the rod into each curtain rod holder to cover up the wallpaper 15 x research source you can pick curtains that go all the way down to the floor or you can choose some that hit mid way on the wall to put shelves or a table underneath them put up a large mirror in the middle of the wall for a statement piece pick out a large mirror that takes up most of the wall space find a stud in the wall by knocking on it and listening for a full not hollow sound then place 1 to 2 screws into the stud hang the mirror up with mounting hooks to keep the eye away from the wallpaper and onto the statement mirror 16 x research source if you have a stud finder you can also use that to look for a stud in the wall try looking for large mirrors at a thrift store to find a cheap one if you can t find a stud in your wall insert a wall anchor into the wall before you put the screws in use posters or photos to distract from the wallpaper pick out some framed posters artwork or photographs of you and your loved ones and arrange them on your wall use nails to hang up each piece and distract the eye from your wallpaper 17 x research source you can even cover your entire wall with posters if you have enough,Home-and-Garden
how to adjust a dual adjustable pulley,dual adjustable pulleys sometimes called a dap are workout machines that allow for an almost unlimited number of exercises they re easy to use and you can work out every muscle in your body depending on how you adjust them they also feature a variety of different handles and attachments you can use to add even more variations make sure the pulleys are locked into place choose a weight that s appropriate for you to avoid injuring yourself and get out there and have fun,locate the adjustment button or lever on the pulley check the backside or the side of the pulley look for a knob like button or a lever that s locked into place 1 x research source some dual pulley machines may have a guard or cover over the button so it doesn t accidentally get activated while you re working out pull the button or push the lever to disengage the pulley hold the pulley with 1 hand and use your other hand to pull the button you ll feel a pin slide out of the slot locking it in place if the pulley uses a lever press the lever up to release the locking mechanism 2 x research source releasing the locking mechanism means the pulley can drop to the floor so make sure you re holding onto it with 1 of your hands if you re having trouble pulling the button or pushing the lever use 1 hand to slightly lift the pulley to make it easier to disengage the lock slide the pulley up or down to your preferred height use your hands to raise or lower the pulley when you ve adjusted it to the height you want it based on the exercises you plan to do keep it held in place 3 x research source for example if you plan to do bicep curls you ll want to lower the pulley all the way to the floor but if you want to do an exercise like tricep pushdowns raise the pulley all of the way to the top for an exercise like back rows place the pulley so it s even with your chest if the pulley uses a button keep the button pulled out as you slide the pulley up or down so it doesn t lock into place most pulley machines have a numbering system on the pulley rail that you can use to choose a height release the button or lever to lock the pulley in place keeping the pulley held where you want it let go of the button or press the lever down to lock it in place give the pulley a good wiggle to make sure it s locked in and won t come loose 4 x research source change the height of the other pulley so they match hold the pulley with 1 hand and pull the button or push the lever to disengage the lock slide the pulley up or down to line it up with the other pulley so they re even release the button or push the lever to lock it in place 5 x research source if the pulley has numbered markings on the rail use them to match the 2 pulley heights for example if the first pulley is set to a 5 adjust the other pulley so it s also set to 5 find the weight stack on the interior of the machine dual adjustable pulley machines use weight plates to add resistance to the cables check on the inside of the pulley machine or on the backside look for a stack of thin metal plates with numbered markings on them to locate the weight stack 6 x research source most pulley machines will have weights listed in ascending order or smallest to largest for instance the first plate may be labeled 5 for 5 pounds 2 3 kg the second plate may say 10 for 10 pounds 4 5 kg and so on pull the selector pin out of the weight plate look for a metal pin in the center of 1 of the weight plates pull the pin and slide it all of the way out of the plate 7 x research source some pins are designed to be a little difficult to remove as an added safety measure you may need to tug or yank on the pin to get it out make sure you aren t pulling on the cable or there isn t a handle attached to the carabiner on the end the weight of a handle can slightly elevate the plate and make it difficult to remove the pin slide the pin into a different plate to adjust the weight on the pulley look at the numbered markings on the front of the plates choose the weight you want to adjust the pulley system to and slide into the plate until it s all of the way inside 8 x research source if you haven t used the machine before or you re trying a new exercise start low with something like 10 pounds 4 5 kg if it s too easy you can always add more weight some pins may snap or click into place when they re fully inserted adjust the weight on the other pulley so they match find the pin connected to a weight plate and pull it out slide the pin into a plate with the same weight marking as the other pulley so they re the same weight 9 x research source you want both pulleys to have the same amount of resistance so there isn t an imbalance when you work out attach handles to the carabiner to use the pulley machine dual adjustable pulley systems allow you to change the types of handles you use for different exercises and variations look at the rack on or near the machine and choose a handle connect the handle to the carabiner on the end of the pulley cable then attach a matching handle to the cable of the other pulley so they match 10 x research source choose handles that give you a strong and comfortable grip connect a rope attachment to 1 pulley for arm exercises many pulley machines include an optional rope attachment which allows you to use 2 hands to grip it as a handle connect the rope attachment to 1 pulley and hold it with both hands to work different arm exercises 11 x research source for example you adjust the pulley so it s all the way down near the floor and use the rope attachment for bicep curls you could also adjust the pulley so it s head height and push down on the handles to work your triceps wrap an ankle strap around your ankle for different leg exercises if there s an ankle strap wrap it around your ankle tightly so it s secure adjust the pulley so it s low to the floor and connect the strap to the carabiner on the pulley cable choose a weight and use the attachment to try different leg exercises 12 x research source for instance with the strap attached to your ankle stand next to the pulley so you re facing it and carefully lift your leg behind you to work your hamstrings and glutes use the bar on top of the pulley for pullups many dual adjustable pulley systems have a crossbar at the top of the machine grip the crossbar with both hands and use it to do pullups you could also hang from the bar and raise your legs to do hanging leg raises which work your abs 13 x research source place a weight bench between the pulleys for bench presses adjust both pulleys so they re all of the way down to the floor and slide a weight bench between them choose a weight and lie on your back on the bench grip both handles and push them up above your chest until your arms are straight lower your arms until your hands are even with your chest and then push them back up again 14 x research source for a good bench press workout which works your chest and arms aim for 3 5 sets of 8 10 repetitions always choose a weight appropriate for you to avoid injury store the accessories on the rack if there s one attached to the machine some dual adjustable pulley systems have a built in storage rack located either on the side or the back of the machine when you re finished with an exercise take off the handles or accessories and place them on the rack so they re stored properly 15 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to take the flash off a polaroid camera,using a polaroid camera and printing off photos in the moment has a special kind of joy and magic associated with it but of course with just one shot to get the photo right there s also a bit of pressure most polaroid pictures need the flash to come out clear and detailed but if you re out in bright sunlight it could make your subject look washed out in that case you may need to override or even cover the flash,turn the camera on with the power switch button or by flipping up the flashbar to engage or disengage the flash function your camera has to be on first most models have a power button located on the front or top of the camera the polaroid snap and some other models turn on when you flip up the flashbar which contains the lens 1 x research source if you re unsure of how to turn on your particular polaroid search online for a user s manual for a diagram of the buttons and functions locate and push down on the flash override button each model is slightly different but you should be able to find this button pretty easily look for the button that shows a lightning bolt with a strike going through it it s usually located next to the flash button or light it may be on the front or the back of your camera 2 x research source polaroids often need a lot of light to turn out well so the cameras are set to automatically use the flash function no matter what the flash button is sometimes just an led light that lights up when the camera is turned on to let you know the flash is ready to go push the shutter button while still holding the flash override button to disengage the flash hold the override button as you take the picture this can be a little tricky if you ve never done it before and sometimes your fingers can get in the way of the lens so take a moment to double check that your hands are out of the way before your snap your photo 3 x research source once you take the photo you can release the override button access the menu on a polaroid snap to turn the flash on or off the polaroid snap is a lot smaller than other models and doesn t have the same buttons or functions on the exterior of the camera turn the camera on and access the menu scroll to the settings option select the flash and tap through the options until a line appears through the lightning bolt 4 x research source remember to turn the flash back on once you re done taking the photo change the lighting by using the lighten darken switch rather than the flash the flash is usually pretty essential to taking great photos with clarity but sometimes you want to make images appear darker or lighter some models of polaroid have a lighten darken switch that can create a brighter or darker photo 5 x research source in dim lighting switch it to the lighten position if it s super bright out switch it to the darken position polaroids polaroid originals and the i 1 cameras have these switches cover the flash with clear tape or tissue paper to reduce its intensity if you need the flash because you re taking a photo indoors but don t like how washed out you end up looking you can diffuse the intensity of the flash by covering it with something light and semi translucent 6 x research source play around with using 1 2 or 3 pieces of tissue paper or tape for different results stand about 2 feet 610 mm away from the subject to take a clear photo if you re too close or too far away the camera lens will focus on either the background or the foreground especially if one of them is a lot darker than the other get in a close range to reduce blurriness 7 x research source this means that selfies are usually out of the question if you re using a polaroid you could use the self timer and set up the camera and position yourself a few feet away from it though to get a self portrait being too close to someone or something can produce a blurry photo sometimes that effect can look cool though if you re new to polaroids try playing around with different techniques to discover what works for you keep the sunlight or main light behind you or off to the side shooting straight into the light will result in a photo with a lot of contrast and you might not be able to see any details of the thing or person you re shooting the best rule of thumb is to stand so you re facing away from the light 8 x research source this is called backlighting crop your photos before you take them to get rid of unwanted visuals with a polaroid you don t have the option to digitally crop and alter images after the fact if you re taking a picture and don t want strangers in the background wait until they re out of the way or reposition your subject so they re not in frame 9 x research source when taking a photo step back for a moment and look at the entire screen to make sure it looks how you want the polaroid snap has the option to take digital photos that you can upload to your computer and then edit but most models print a photo automatically meaning you can t crop the edges hold the camera as still as possible until the photo is finished printing pretend that you re a statue moving around before the picture has fully printed could result in a blurry photograph 10 x research source try holding the camera in the palm of your left hand for extra stability protect your photo from light for 5 15 minutes so it develops fully black and white photos need about 5 10 minutes while color photos should have about 10 15 minutes keep your photo face down or in a pocket 11 x research source you might be tempted to shake the film to help the photo develop but that s a myth leave it alone and move it as little as possible to help your picture come out perfectly 12 x research source keep your camera and photos close to your body in cold weather temperatures lower than 55 f 13 c can make your camera and film produce photos that aren t as colorful or detailed as they could be to prevent this keep your camera warm by carrying it close to your body inside your coat would be great and keep printed photos close to your body too 13 x research source it can be hard to keep pictures close to your body without bending them but do your best gently slide them into a coat pocket if you plan ahead wear a shirt with a big front pocket so you can keep them in there,Home-and-Garden
how to open a headlight of a car,if you want to black out or customize your headlights you ll have to take them apart to access the interior headlights are sealed with a glue like sealant which can make them more difficult to open luckily you only need a few tools and an oven to break the seal around the housing as long as you use low heat and handle the headlight carefully you ll be able to open it without breaking it just be sure to reseal the headlight when you re finished so it doesn t develop any moisture damage,open your vehicle s hood find the lever or button that pops the hood inside your vehicle on the driver s side pull the lever or push the button down until you hear the latch on the hood click open lift the hood up completely so it doesn t fall down while you re working 1 x research source consult with your vehicle s manual if you have trouble finding how to open the hood remove the bumper cover if it s in the way of the headlight the bumper cover is the long body panel on the front of your vehicle that hides the metal bumper if the bumper cover overlaps your headlights locate the bolts holding the cover to the body along the top edge use a socket wrench to rotate the bolts counterclockwise until you can pull them out then look underneath the bumper cover and unscrew any of the bolts there push a flathead screwdriver into the seams between the cover and the wheel wells to expose the hidden bolts so you can loosen them lift the bumper cover up and pull it away from your vehicle to remove it 2 x research source consult with your vehicle s manual if you have any trouble finding the bolts on your bumper cover unscrew the bolts holding the headlight assembly in place look along the top edge of the headlight assembly to find 2 or 3 bolts securing it to your vehicle place a socket wrench over the bolt head and turn it counter clockwise to loosen it continue unscrewing the remaining bolts so the headlight moves around freely 3 x research source there may be 1 or 2 bolts along the bottom or side of the headlight as well unplug the connectors attached to the back of the headlight to remove it wiggle the headlight loose and pull it straight out from your vehicle so you can reach your hand behind it follow the wires coming from your vehicle leading to the back of the headlight find the square block connectors holding the wires and carefully pull them apart once you remove the 1 or 2 connectors you can easily pull the headlight completely out of your vehicle 4 x research source some wires will still hang out from the back of the headlight when you remove it don t try to force the headlight out of your vehicle or else you may damage the connectors remove any screws from the headlight set your headlight upside down on a towel or soft surface so you don t scratch the lens look around the edges of the headlight to find all of the screws holding the lens to the backing turn the screws counterclockwise with a screwdriver to remove them set the screws in a small cup so you don t misplace them 5 x research source double check for screws after you think you ve removed them all if you still have screws in the headlight when you try to open it you could crack or break the lens some headlights may not have screws meaning the lens and backing are only held together with adhesive sealant disconnect the bulbs from the headlight backing locate the backs of the bulbs screwed into the circular ports in the backing pinch the base of the bulb and turn it counter clockwise to make it loose pull the bulb straight out from the backing and set it aside somewhere where it won t get damaged remove any other bulbs in the headlight using the same process 6 x research source you do not have to remove the bulbs if you re not able to you can leave the rubber housing caps attached since the headlight reaches a similar temperature when it s in use the caps won t melt 7 x research source put on disposable gloves and old clothes after you heat up the headlight the sealant will be extremely sticky and adhere to anything it touches wear a pair of disposable work gloves so you don t get any of the sealant on your skin then put on an old shirt that you don t mind getting dirty just in case sealant gets on it 8 x research source you may want to wear a pair of heat resistant gloves underneath your disposable gloves so it s easier to handle the headlight preheat your oven to 220 250 f 104 121 c make sure your oven is large enough to hold the headlight so it doesn t touch the sides move the oven rack to the lowest height before turning your oven on let it preheat completely before you place your headlight inside 9 x research source if you don t have access to an oven you can also use a heat gun and a cardboard box get a box that s large enough to hold your headlight cut a circular hole in the bottom corner that s the same size as the heat gun s nozzle place the heat gun through the hole and turn it on to 250 f 121 c to heat inside the box 10 x research source avoid using the heat gun by hand since you won t heat the sealant evenly and could risk breaking the headlight assembly 11 x research source set the headlight on wood planks inside your oven wood doesn t hold heat as well as metal so it s perfect for keeping your headlight safe when you bake it use 2 in 4 in 5 1 cm 10 2 cm boards that are short enough to fit inside your oven lay the planks on the oven rack and set your headlight inside make sure the headlight doesn t touch the rack or sides of the oven directly or else it could melt 12 x research source if you don t have pieces of wood you can also use a cookie sheet lined with 1 2 layers of baking paper your headlight will not get damaged from the heat as long as it doesn t make contact with metal leave the headlight in your oven for 15 minutes keep the door closed while you re baking the headlight so the heat can circulate around it after 5 10 minutes check your headlight to make sure it hasn t shifted or fallen off of the planks after 15 minutes use oven mitts to remove the headlight from the oven so you can start working on it 13 x research source pop the tabs holding the lens to the headlight backing locate the plastic tabs that hold the lens to the backing around the edges of your headlight lift each tab up with your fingers to separate the 2 pieces of your headlight if you have trouble peeling them apart by hand position a pry bar or flathead screwdriver under the tab and pry it up work your way around the entire perimeter until you ve undone all the tabs 14 x research source be gentle with the tabs or else they ll break and your headlight won t stay together as well pry the lens off of the backing with a flathead screwdriver position the tip of your screwdriver in the bottom corner of your headlight so it s in the seam between the clear lens and headlight backing carefully push the screwdriver into the seam and tilt the handle down toward the backing to lift the lens out from the adhesive after you make a small gap try gently pulling the pieces apart by hand if you need to work the screwdriver around the seam to separate the pieces 15 x research source the sealant will harden as it cools down and make it more difficult to pull the headlight apart if you need to place the headlight back in your oven for another few minutes to soften it again be careful not to scratch the headlight lens with the tip of your screwdriver scrape the old sealant off of the backing with your screwdriver place the tip of your screwdriver in the channel around the edge of the headlight backing run the screwdriver around the entire perimeter of the backing to work out as much sealant as you can wipe the screwdriver clean as it gets dirty so it doesn t get stuck 16 x research source removing sealant works best while it s still warm and malleable if the sealant solidified try putting the backing in your oven for another 5 minutes to soften it avoid leaving the old sealant in the headlight since it may form air bubbles and won t seal properly make your modifications to your headlight once you have your headlight assembly open you can easily access the interior parts so you can customize them if you want to black out your headlights tape off the reflectors and areas you don t want to get paint on then use black spray paint to coat the backing 17 x research source if you want to install halo lights attach the light kit around the edges of the backing and run the wires through one of the holes or seams in the backing so you can attach them to your vehicle 18 x research source if you need to wire new lights to your vehicle s electrical system make sure to disconnect the battery first so you don t shock yourself press new butyl sealant into the channel on the headlight backing butyl sealant is a flexible rubber material that s used to make an airtight seal so moisture can t get into the lights tear off a piece of the sealant and press it into the channel with your fingers continue running the strip of sealant around the outer edge of the backing so it s flush with the surface once you ve gone completely around the channel cut the piece of sealant and press the edges down 19 x research source you can buy butyl sealant online or from an automotive parts store butyl sealant is stretchy and malleable so you can mold it into the channel until it fits perfectly preheat your oven to 275 f 135 c place the oven rack on the bottom position so there s enough room for air to circulate around your headlight turn the oven on to 275 f 135 c and let it heat up completely before you put your headlight inside 20 x research source set the backing in the oven for 10 15 minutes to soften the sealant place the headlight on wood planks inside your oven so the channel with sealant faces up close the oven door and leave the backing inside for at least 10 minutes the sealant will become more malleable and slightly melt to fill in any air bubbles after 10 15 minutes pass take the headlight out of your oven 21 x research source avoid setting the headlight directly on the rack or against the sides of your oven or else the plastic could melt screw the lens onto the backing align the lens with the channel in the backing and press it down firmly to reseal the light take the screws you removed from the backing earlier and feed them through the holes in the holes in the backing turn the screws clockwise with a screwdriver until they re tight to secure the headlight assembly 22 x research source it s okay if some of the sealant drips out from the channel when you reinsert the lens just wipe off the excess with a paper towel or scrape it off with your screwdriver clamp the backing and lens together so it doesn t shift place the first clamps in the corners of the headlight to hold the lens in place then place 1 or 2 more clamps on each side of the headlight so they re evenly spaced this helps ensure the lens sets in the right place without it slipping 23 x research source make sure the clamps are heat resistant or made from metal so they re safe to put in your oven put the headlight back in your oven for 5 minutes to seal it set the headlight back on the wood planks and keep it in your oven to let the sealant fill in around the lens after 5 minutes pull the headlight back out of the oven and let it rest until it s cool 24 x research source reattach the bulbs to the backing once the headlight feels cool to the touch feed the bulbs back through the ports in the backing push the bulb in as far as it will go before turning it clockwise to secure it in place screw in any remaining bulbs until you ve completely assembled the headlight again 25 x research source use new bulbs if you don t want to worry about the old ones burning out connect the headlight back to your vehicle pop the hood open on your vehicle and hold your headlight assembly near its port plug the connectors into the headlight s backing again to reconnect it to power push the headlight into position and secure it to your vehicle with bolts reattach any other pieces you had to remove from your vehicle to finish your repair 26 x research source after plugging in the connectors try starting your vehicle s battery and turn on your headlights to make sure they work properly if they don t then there may be an issue with the connection or bulb,Home-and-Garden
how to prevent wood floors from separating,nothing can be more nerve racking than stumbling across two beautiful floorboards that appear to be splitting apart since wood swells when it absorbs moisture and it contracts when it dries out a little separation between individual floorboards is completely normal however if these separations become too large the gaps can become frustrating and visibly noticeable 1 x research source low humidity is the main culprit when it comes to wood floors separating so the best way to keep your wood floors stable is to maintain a consistent humidity and temperature in your home,keep the temperature between 60 80 f 16 27 c at all times when the temperature drops the air tends to dry out when the temperature spikes the air tends to retain moisture for longer to keep the wood flooring stable keep the temperature in your home roughly 60 80 f 16 27 c at all times try to avoid raising or lowering the temperature too far outside of this range to keep the wood stable 2 x research source once your wood floor is installed you cannot do anything to prevent separation outside of controlling the environment there are no secret finishes or tricks the goal is simply to create a hospitable environment for the wood luckily this isn t typically too hard to do low humidity is the main culprit when it comes to wood flooring separating but temperature plays a role as well wood tends to stiffen and become brittle when it s cold and soften and warp when it gets extremely hot temperature alone is unlikely to cause boards to separate but it may weaken your flooring over time try not to worry if you see some minor separation controlling the humidity and temperature will fix most minor separation issues monitor the humidity with a hygrometer and keep it at 30 50 a hygrometer is basically a thermostat for humidity pick a hygrometer up at a drug store or online and leave it out in the room where you re worried about the floors separating check the hygrometer on occasion to monitor the humidity and aim to keep the humidity between 30 50 at all times keep in mind low humidity is more likely to lead to separation than high humidity 3 x research source when wood dries out it retracts and compresses if the humidity is really low your boards are likely to shrink and separate from one another the good news is that your body prefers 30 50 humidity as well you re more likely to be comfortable if the humidity isn t extremely high or low use a humidifier to keep your home humid air conditioning tends to dry the air out when you leave it on if you don t have central air in your home or you have central air with no humidity control purchase a humidifier whenever the humidity drops turn the humidifier on to pump some moisture into the air and raise the humidity levels this will keep your floorboards from suffering when the air conditioning is running 4 x research source you can use multiple humidifiers if you have a larger home or multiple floors hire a contractor to install a humidity controller if you have central air most central air units can be fitted with a humidity controller to pump more moisture into the air whenever you turn your air on if you have central air but you have no way of controlling the humidity hire an hvac technician to install a humidity controller next to your thermostat they ll install a second dial or screen where you can set custom humidity levels this is the easiest albeit most expensive solution if you re worried about wood flooring separating 5 x research source depending on how big your home is or how fancy your central air unit is this may cost anywhere from 200 1 000 this may be worth it if you want to maintain a stable humidity level though once you have a humidity controller installed keep it permanently set to anywhere from 30 50 try to avoid exceeding this range use a dehumidifier in the summer if you re in a humid region high humidity is rarely an issue when it comes to wood flooring separating but too much humidity can be terrible for your floor if you start getting up to 70 90 humidity if you live in a humid region and you don t have a humidity controller connected to your central air set a dehumidifier out and leave it running to keep the humidity levels low 6 x research source high humidity is normally not a cause of separation because the wood boards expand and get closer together there are typically small gaps intentionally left between boards to account for this expansion still if the boards start rubbing directly against one another it could lead to splitting or cupping use wood filler to fill minor gaps between separated boards if your boards have separated 1 2 in 1 3 cm or less fill the gap in with some wood filler purchase a wood filler that matches the general color of your floor and squirt the filler in between the boards that separated use your finger to smooth the filler out and wait at least 2 6 hours then you can stain the filler if you have a stained floor and the color doesn t match 7 x research source you don t have to stain the filler or anything if you don t want to once it dries you can walk on the floor and the gap should be filled wash your hands if you smoothed the filler out with your finger it s non toxic and it isn t dangerous but it will be much harder to wash off if it dries if the opening between your boards is deeper than 1 2 in 1 3 cm do this in 2 3 layers spread a thin layer out first in between the gap and then fill in the remainder of the gap after 6 hours have passed replace floorboards that have separated more than 1 2 1 inch 1 3 2 5 cm if the separation is large and your boards have warped you must replace the floorboards use a spade bit to bore a small hole at the end of each board you re removing then drive a circular saw halfway through the board at the first hole and run it through the board to the hole on the opposite side this will split the board and make it easier to remove use a chisel to pry out the split board before cutting your replacement boards to size and nailing them into place 8 x research source this process can be pretty frustrating and delicate if you aren t an experienced woodworker you re better off hiring a contractor to do this for you if you don t have a lot of experience with power tools hire a contractor to damp proof your subfloor if the problem persists if your entire floor keeps warping separating or cupping when you are controlling the humidity and temperature your subfloor is likely the culprit if moisture gets trapped in the subfloor and your boards start separating in an odd uneven way hire a flooring service to damp proof your subfloor and replace your floorboards this may be expensive but it s not realistically something you can do on your own 9 x research source damp proofing typically involves stapling or gluing a specially treated sheet in between the subfloor and the floorboards to keep moisture from soaking into your floorboards damp proofing typically costs 5 per 1 square foot 0 093 m2 you ll need to pay for the flooring installation as well if you aren t doing it yourself this will typically cost 5 10 per 1 square foot 0 093 m2 dry your floor out and replace the subfloor if your boards are buckling and wet buckling occurs when floorboards that start peeling off of the ground if you have a buckling wet floor there s too much moisture under your floorboards dry the floor out by wiping any moisture up and running a dehumidifier to dry the wood out 10 x research source if the floor doesn t return to normal hire a contractor to install foam boards or spray foam in your subfloor before getting your floorboards repaired this should solve any future buckling issues 11 x research source your floorboards may return to normal after you dry the floor out entirely if this is the case you may not need to repair anything for now the problem may come back in the future if you have a moisture retaining subfloor though heavy use of the air conditioning during hot summer months can make this problem worse try to avoid running your ac all the time when it s extremely hot and dry out 12 x research source if your basement or main floor is buckling and getting wet the foundation of your home may be absorbing too much moisture you may need to damp proof your entire basement if this is the case 13 x research source choose narrower wood boards when selecting your flooring style when choosing your boards select wood boards that are 2 inches 5 1 cm wide or thinner the thinner the wood boards are the less room the individual boards will have to expand and contract over time thick 6 8 in 15 20 cm boards may retract up to 1 2 in 1 3 cm in dry weather while a 2 in 5 1 cm board may only retract 1 16 1 32 in 0 159 0 079 cm 14 x research source thinner boards are also less prone to cupping which is where wood boards bend up along the edges due to moisture and temperature changes in your subfloor select solid wood for best results if you re refinishing a floor or installing new boards and you re worried about separation choose solid wood flooring instead of engineered or factory finished wood solid wood is a little more resilient when it comes to handling dry air which is typically what triggers separation 15 x research source when choosing a species pick a type of wood that grows locally in your area if a type of wood thrives in the wild where you live it will thrive indoors as well for example several species of pine are common in the southwestern united states if you re installing a new floor in arizona or california solid pine is extremely likely to hold up over time it s perfectly fine to use factory finished or engineered wood your floor is not automatically going to separate just because you aren t using solid wood you can still reduce the odds that your floor separates by choosing a native wood species selecting thinner boards and acclimating your wood acclimate the wood by leaving it out for 4 5 days before installation before you install your flooring stack your boards on top of one another like a log cabin in the room where you plan on installing them leave the wood boards out for 4 5 days this way the wood will adjust to the natural air temperature and humidity in the room if the boards are going to warp expand or retract they ll do it before they re installed on the floor this will keep the boards from shifting dramatically once you re done with the installation 16 x research source it s extremely important to acclimate wood boards to the environment where they re going to be installed if you don t acclimate the wood the boards will start warping sliding expanding or retracting after you ve glued or nailed them into the floor this can cause the boards to separate or even split install the floorboards in the spring or fall when humidity is moderate if you install a wood floor when the humidity is extremely high the boards will retract dramatically once the humidity drops if you put your boards in when the humidity is low the floorboards will expand and possibly split after the humidity rises wait for a day in spring or fall when the temperature outside is roughly 60 f 16 c and the humidity is roughly 40 to install your flooring 17 x research source this way your flooring will settle and have plenty of time to acclimate before the high or low humidity seasons hit,Home-and-Garden
how to tie net wire fence,a net wire fence is a type of woven wire fencing that looks like a grid of medium sized rectangular squares you might choose to put up a net wire fence to keep farm animals in a certain area of your property for example in order to install a net wire fence make sure you already have wooden corner posts driven into the ground to tie the end wires around the fencing is heavy and unwieldy so make sure you also get an extra pair of hands to help you out with the job with some elbow grease patience and the right technique you can have a new net wire fence built on your property in an afternoon or two,install wooden corner posts use round wooden corner posts that are 4 6 in 10 15 cm in diameter for the best results when installing a net wire fence it will be easiest to wrap the end wires around round posts 1 x research source you could also use square posts if you don t have round ones it will just be a little more awkward to wrap and tie the end wires around them if your fence is going to be longer than 50 ft 15 m install an anchor post of the same type as your corner posts every 30 50 ft 9 1 15 2 m for additional stability the posts in between the corner posts can be smaller wooden posts or metal t posts it s up to you and the look you re going for or what your budget allows for they should be placed about every 10 ft 3 0 m put on a pair of heavy work gloves safety glasses and sturdy footwear these will protect your hands eyes and feet from accidents while you install your net wire fence the ends of the wires are very sharp so it s easy to scratch or cut yourself 2 x research source you ll need a helper for this project make sure they are wearing all the proper protective gear as well roll out a length of net wire fencing on the ground where you will install it lay your roll of net wire fencing on the ground at 1 corner of the fence unroll it completely so that it reaches the opposite corner post and is laying on the ground in the position you will install it in 3 x research source depending on how big and heavy your roll of fencing is you might want to have your helper push it along with you to unroll it it will be easier and faster this way net wire fencing is available in different roll lengths so you can probably get the right length for the fence you re building if you can t find the exact length get a longer roll and cut it to size using high tensile wire cutters hold the end of the net wire fencing up against a corner post have a helper lift the fencing up off the ground with you and hold it in position while you secure it place the end of the fencing against the corner post so that the last column of wire squares in the netting of the fence rests against the post 4 x research source have your assistant help hold the fencing up straight while you align the end on the post hammer a galvanized fence staple over the second wire down from the top place a u shaped galvanized fence staple on top of the second row of wire down from the top of the fencing use a hammer to drive the staple into the wooden fence post to hold the fencing in place 5 x research source double check that the fence is lined up straight on the post before you drive the fence staple in to hold it in place staple every other wire to the fence post position galvanized fence staples over every other row of wire underneath the first staple you put in hammer them into the wooden post as you go until you reach the bottom 6 x research source you don t have to worry about being super precise with the placement of the staples as long as they hold the wire in place on the corner post it s fine start with 1 of the middle end wires and wrap it around the corner post grab 1 of the end wires from 1 of the horizontal line wires around the middle of the fence wrap it all the way around the corner post until it crosses back over the horizontal section of itself 7 x research source the line wires are the sections of the wire netting that run horizontally at a 90 degree angle to the post starting with an end wire from one of the line wires near the middle will make the fence more stable while you finish tying all of it bend the wire into a z shape where it crosses over itself hold the end wire where it crosses back over the horizontal line wire to mark where to bend it bend it back once at this point at about a 45 degree angle then bend it forward again about 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm up from the first bend to make a z shape 8 x research source you don t have to be precise with the bends or the shape just make a rough z loop the z bent part of the wire back over the line wire hook the first bend of the z shape over the horizontal line wire so the next section of the z starts going back under it pull the bent wire back under and up over the line wire between the end wire and the post to make a loop 9 x research source the loop doesn t have to be tight twist the remaining wire over the line wire in 2 5 spirals pull the last bend in the wire up over top of itself and the line wire so it isn t between the end wire and the post anymore push the loop in the wire close to the post then wrap the excess about 2 5 times around the horizontal line wire 10 x research source it should now look like there is 1 loop and 2 full spirals of the end wire wrapped around the horizontal line wire break the excess wire off by bending it 90 degrees back bend the excess wire down to weaken it first bend it backwards about a half turn at a 90 degree angle to the way you wrapped it to snap it 11 x research source this will leave the wire tied securely around itself with no loose ends the wire should snap fairly easily however if you re having trouble with this you can always use high tensile wire cutters instead tie rest of the end wires using the exact same method wrap each end wire over the line wire by bending it into a z shape and twisting it in 2 5 spirals over the line wire bend the excess wire back at about 90 degrees to the direction you wrapped it in to snap it off 12 x research source the order you do the next wires in doesn t matter stretch the fence tight to the other post and repeat the whole process hold the opposite end of the net wire fence up against the opposite corner posts stretch it tight and staple every other row of wire to the post using galvanized fence staples and your hammer tie all the end wires starting with 1 in the middle and break off the excess wire length 13 x research source,Home-and-Garden

can get boxes for free try an exchange website like freecycle org or go to a local bookstore grocery store or liquor store to see if they have boxes to spare 13 x research source try to pack heavier items like books in smaller boxes otherwise you might end up with a bunch of boxes that are too heavy to move you ll also need packaging tape and padding material such as bubble wrap foam peanuts or wadded up newspaper label the boxes so you know what s in them when you re packing a bunch of stuff it can be easy to lose track of what s in which box you ll have a much easier time unpacking and organizing your things when you move in if you label your boxes use a permanent marker like a sharpie to label your boxes you might also find it helpful to number your boxes and keep a packing list this can help you keep track of your boxes and make sure none of them get lost in the shuffle prepare any large furniture items for transportation depending on the size of your furniture and how sturdy it is some pieces may need special preparation for example if you are moving a chest of drawers consider wrapping it in plastic wrap to protect the chest and keep the drawers in place some items may need to be partially disassembled for easier transport and move in e g you might need to take the legs off your couch to get it through the apartment door put any loose parts in a bag and tape it to the furniture wrap any fragile items in moving blankets or furniture pads to protect them from bumps and scratches ask friends or family members to help you move moving all your stuff on your own can be extremely difficult if you can recruit some family members or a few friends to help you out if you get friends to help you you might even offer to pay them a little bit or treat them to dinner afterwards if you don t have any friends or family who can help you consider hiring professional movers be sure to do your research and read online reviews of any companies you are considering so that you know they are trustworthy transport your belongings to your new apartment rent a moving van if necessary even if you don t have a lot of stuff you might find it hard to fit it all into the family car renting a van or truck can be especially helpful if you re moving long distance and can t make multiple trips to bring over all your belongings search online for truck rental companies in your area and read up on their terms and prices look for online reviews to determine if the company is reliable and trustworthy when you rent the truck speak with the rental agent to make sure you understand all rental requirements including when and how to return the vehicle when you are done move boxes into the rooms where the contents belong once you ve gotten your belongings to the new apartment put the boxes into the appropriate rooms this will make the unpacking process much easier for example move any boxes containing dishes food or cooking supplies into the kitchen put your bed linens and clothing in the bedroom make a list of items you need but don t already have if you re moving into your first apartment you ll likely need to buy quite a few necessities go through your new apartment room by room and try to think of everything that you will need for each room these might include things like 14 x research source major furniture items such as a bed a couch or futon a

soaps and detergents hygiene basics like towels bath soap hand soap toothbrush and toothpaste and toilet paper save money by buying items second hand when you re moving into an apartment for the first time your budget will probably already be stretched thin consider getting some of your necessities second hand while you get established you can always replace them with new items later check local thrift stores or browse on websites like craigslist or the facebook marketplace for used furniture and other must haves you can also look for yard sale flyers in your new neighborhood your parents

how to decorate a loft apartment,decorating a loft apartment can sometimes seem a little tricky loft apartments typically have an open floor plan which can make it hard to create a cohesive feel whether your apartment has tons of space or features more of a cozy layout it s important to create defined spaces within the loft that mimic traditional rooms in addition try to make use of any natural lighting in the apartment and look for creative storage solutions for anything you don t want on full display,use furniture to block off areas to create the feel of individual rooms one of the first challenges when you re working with an open space is to break it into usable sections try arranging your furniture to create specific areas within the larger space you can use bookshelves sofas bedroom furniture and tables as boundaries for each space 1 x research source for instance if you re creating a living room space you might place a sofa and a loveseat in an l shape with end tables on either side of the seating area an entertainment console and tv across from the sofa and a coffee table in the middle of the room to make an office area you might set up a desk a short bookshelf where you store your work supplies and a comfortable office chair add carpets and rugs to help define each space you don t just have to rely on your furniture to help create visual boundaries large carpets and rugs can help anchor a space making each area feel deliberate and self contained this works especially well for living and sleeping areas but you can also use rugs to create a cozy entryway define a dining area and more 2 x research source opt for floor coverings in light colored neutrals if you want to create an airy feel or go bold with pops of color if that s more your style 3 x research source leave 36 in 91 cm walkways to ensure there s plenty of room it can be a challenge to create individual spaces while still preserving the open flow of a loft apartment especially if your loft is on the smaller side make sure you always leave plenty of room for your walkways otherwise even the most open space will feel cramped and crowded 4 x research source for example if you have a path where you walk from your living area to your kitchen you would want to ensure that all of the furniture walls and decor along that path are spaced at least 36 in 91 cm use folding screens or panels to create wall like partitions if you want a space to have a little more privacy create the illusion of walls by setting up folding screens or panels these are typically lightweight and easy to move around so you don t have to commit to a certain layout 5 x research source if you own the loft or have permission from the owner you can even install tracking in the ceilings to hang drapes that way you can easily open the drapes when you want the apartment to feel more spacious but you can close them when you want privacy you can even install sliding walls or bookshelves for more permanent partitions this is a great way to make a bedroom feel more private to create an area where you can change clothes or to wall off distractions from a study space install unique light fixtures to define each space if you can change out the light fixtures in your loft try using different styles in different areas of the house for instance a chandelier over your dining area will create an intimate setting for your meals while pendant lights in your kitchen might add warmth while visually separating the space 6 x research source use repeating elements to make the loft feel more cohesive as you re decorating your apartment look for a certain pattern texture shape or color that you can use in different places around the space that way when someone looks at the space as a whole everything will be tied together 7 x research source for instance you might decorate your loft in rich warm neutrals but then have fuscia colored accents throughout the apartment to tie it all together you can even use repeating shapes to create a cohesive feel for instance you could hang round picture frames and clocks on the walls use a round rug in the living area and have a round dining table use pops of color to make the space feel bright due to their high ceilings and open layout loft apartments can feel somewhat industrial if you want to bring warmth into the loft use brightly colored decorations as focal points throughout the space 8 x research source for example if you have wide open walls you might choose an oversized painting or wall hanging in an eye catching hue 9 x research source throw pillows rugs and vases can also be used to add color to your space use smaller proportioned furniture for a tiny loft not all loft apartments are warehouse sized if your loft is on the smaller side stick to scaled down furniture like a loveseat instead of a sofa or a bistro table instead of a large traditional dining set 10 x research source you might also opt for furniture that you can easily see through to make the space seem larger for instance a solid wood end table would block your view and make the room feel closed off however a table made of metal and glass would almost create the perception that there s nothing there hang sheer curtains to use any natural light that s available it can be a challenge to adequately light a large loft so it s important to make the best use of your natural light loft apartments often have large windows so opt for sheer curtains that will allow some of that light to filter through 11 x research source if you have the option you might also want to arrange your space so your office dining area or living space are placed closest to the windows since they need to be well lit don t feel like you have to limit yourself to white curtains you can find sheer curtains in almost any color you can imagine hang shelves to make use of your vertical space storage space is always at a premium when you have an open floor plan because there aren t many closets or corners where you can tuck things if you have high ceilings hang shelves at and above eye level so you can stash important items that don t necessarily need to be out in the open 12 x research source keep paperwork and other items tidy by placing them in attractive boxes or folders before you store them on the shelf floating shelves look especially nice on exposed brick or stone walls and they ll allow you to preserve your loft s cool industrial feel if you don t want to permanently install shelves just place a bookcase against the wall use baskets to hold extra linens or other miscellaneous items piles of blankets look untidy but if you neatly fold those same blankets and place them in a pretty woven basket you immediately get a warm homey feel you can then tuck the basket beneath a console table place it at the foot of your bed or store it in a corner out of the way somewhere a large basket with a lid is a great place to store winter coats and accessories when the weather turns warm 13 x research source place ottomans in your living area to combine extra seating and storage many ottomans feature a lid that lifts off to reveal hidden storage space inside with the lid on though the ottoman will just look like a place to prop your feet or extra seating in case you have guests drop by some ottomans even have trays on top so they can also function as an end table or a coffee table 14 x research source use the ottoman to store items that you don t necessarily need to keep out in the open like throw blankets books or purses stash shoes and off season clothing under your bed if your bed is lifted off the ground visit a home store and look for under bed storage solutions these are often wide shallow boxes made to slip beneath your mattress to give you extra storage space while keeping you organized 15 x research source this is a great option if you have a huge shoe collection or you need somewhere to put your cozy sweater collection when the weather gets warm use rolling clothes racks if you need more closet space if you have more clothes than you have closet visit a home store or big box store and purchase a metal or pvc clothes rack these often have casters on the bottom so you can move them easily and they re usually inexpensive 16 x research source try hanging your very favorite clothes on the rolling rack since they ll be on display when anyone comes over you can also use shelves with wire baskets to store your accessories or clothing you wouldn t normally hang like your undergarments tights or tank tops,Home-and-Garden
how to maximize space in your apartment,apartments especials in urban centers tend to be small every square foot needs to work however this is an opportunity to focus on what is really important in a living space functionality valuing space and avoiding unnecessary clutter a small living space can be a great living space with some thought tidiness and ingenuity,know how much space you have if you are going to maximize your space you need to know how much you have measure the height of each room as well high or low ceilings can affect the amount of space you have use a tape measure to find the dimensions of every room you have in feet or meters having a floor plan is helpful as well the layout of a room is often as important as the size it helps to have these measurements kept in a handy location such as a purse or binder when furniture shopping or thrift store browsing create multipurpose workspaces think about where you spend time in the apartment and especially where you store your day to day work and entertainment if you re using the whole place but still feeling cramped try consolidating some of it 1 x research source similar tasks can usually be done in the same setting your reading corner computer station and work desk can all be in the same corner for example a bookcase can be a good way to divide a room creating some division while also providing valuable shelf space 2 x research source look for other ways to divide a room that emphasizes these spaces even without using walls consider non traditional arrangements for instance if you do not entertain and do not need a large table you likely do not need a traditional dining room instead a small cafe style table may free up needed room or use folding tables if you do have friends over think vertically make use of every square foot and think of using space right up to the ceiling select tall furniture instead of lower wider pieces 3 x research source you can install two rods in your closet hanging shirts from the top one and longer clothing items from the lower try to go floor to ceiling with bookshelves taking up as much space as possible consider collapsible furniture a bed can take up a huge amount of room in a small apartment if you re willing to replace it with a roll up sleeping pad you ll have much more space during the day similarly you can buy chairs that fold up under the table or footrests that slide under the couch 4 x research source use storage furniture an ottoman with space for storing cushions or books serves two purposes at once a coffee table or end table with drawers gives you even more space in your living room a bed with a trundle underneath it lets you use space that would otherwise have nothing but dust and lost socks 5 x research source use boxes and urns as decorative storage they come in all shapes and sizes to match your decor and they are great for concealing a number of necessary items from baking supplies to tv remotes to loose change these art pieces can hold all kinds of practical objects try putting some bins and boxes underneath your existing tables and beds you may not need to buy new furniture depending on what fits if your bed is too low to put things under it you can buy a bed lift to raise it up just a few inches can create extra space for boxes and containers there are containers that you can buy specifically made to fit under beds 6 x research source use as much wall space as possible almost anything can be mounted onto a wall or placed on a newly installed shelf freeing up floor space as storage space bookshelves are a great place to put decorative objects and more space efficient than end tables for example replace a floor lamp with a smaller lamp on a shelf you can use shelf dividers as well to help organize your things or create smaller as needed shelves to maximize the space you are using the inside of closet doors can provide additional space to hang or mount items a spice rack looks good and can be very convenient on the inside of a pantry door hanging pots and pans in your kitchen can save cabinet and drawer space and makes you look like a serious cook hang bulletin boards on walls and doors reduce paper clutter in the kitchen with bulletin board or fridge magnets make use of the space on a closed door by hanging additional bulletin boards or decorations if you have a flat screen tv hang it on the wall don t get rid of the tv stand instead use it for more shelf space 7 x research source a cheap wine rack can be a great place for your bathroom towels you ll be surprised to discover that rolled up bathroom towels fit well in a wine rack creating extra space in your cupboards hang a hook from your ceiling use this to hang houseplants or extra storage containers if you have a high enough ceiling you can go a step further and replace bulky lamps with a chandelier hang a rack in your shower a rack hanging from the shower head is a space efficient way to store bathroom supplies get rid of extra stuff from clothing to unused kitchen tools to furniture you can probably find something to throw out donate objects in good condition to charity and throw out the rest as a rule of thumb if you haven t used something in a year you can probably get rid of it if you have not used an item in 12 months it is most likely clutter the same goes for anything that does not really bring you happiness or does not function well such as being broken or too big or small a garage sale is another good way to give your stuff to people who need it more put objects in storage if you have furniture that simply does not work for the space consider renting a storage facility this includes things like grandma s china cabinet that you will use when you get a larger place a storage locker is also good for rotating seasonal items like clothing that you will only wear part of the year 8 x research source check with your property owner for nearby storage facilities he or she may have some tips on the good ones nearby and might even have a deal with one if you have a friend or relative with a large house he or she may let you store these objects in an attic or basement for free consider cost of storage however storage units have a cost every month which while modest can really add up over time is it really worth hundreds of dollars to hold on to your old furniture transfer paper records to digital scan your files and photographs to make digital copies a single hard drive can easily store every paper record you have in the apartment just make sure to make at least one back up so you don t lose the files to a technological error store odds and ends in empty jars spare jars or plastic food containers can store the little miscellaneous objects that build up from children s toys to nails and screws these are good to have around if you are out of room in your kitchen cupboards store pasta and other dry food in empty jars place these on top of the kitchen cabinets for

panicking most elevators are secure when they are stuck or stranded they will not go into a state of free fall and are secure even when stopped the elevator is also not airtight so you will have more than enough oxygen to stay in the elevator safely remember all of this when you are in the elevator so you do not panic you should also not worry about being trapped in the dark in the elevator as most elevators will still have working lights even when stopped there is also likely emergency lighting that will come on in the elevator if the power goes out if for some reason there is smoke in the elevator you may try to pry open the door to let in fresh air or to try to escape but this can lead to injury so unless the smoke is overwhelming and severe you should avoid tampering with the elevator doors in any way press the alarm or call button in the elevator look for the alarm or call button on the panel in the elevator the button will be labeled call or alarm or it may have an alarm bell or phone symbol on it press this button to notify building maintenance that you are stuck in the elevator there should be someone on the other end who can answer your call and get help for you 1 x research source if there is no alarm button there may be an emergency telephone in the elevator use the emergency telephone to call for help use your cellphone to call for help if no one is

standing up in the elevator can lead to feelings of anxiety and vertigo try to get comfortable on the floor use jackets or bags to prop yourself up hold onto your bag or your coat if that helps you stay calm do deep breathing exercises to help you stay calm in the elevator do deep breathing exercises find a comfortable seated position then inhale for four counts through your nose hold it and then exhale for four counts through your mouth do this several times until you feel calm and relaxed 4 x research source you can try closing your eyes to help you stay calm as you deep breath if you

way most emergency personnel will respond within 20 minutes to an hour after being called to a stranded elevator 5 x research source if there is anyone in the elevator who is stressed anxious or has a medical issue try to keep them calm be polite and comforting to them stress that help is coming soon get this information before you call someone for help and relay the info to the person you call this will be extremely helpful so that emergency personnel know as much as possible about the situation at hand distract yourself with games and conversation to distract yourself from your situation play games and talk to the others in the car introduce yourselves and chat about your day or yourselves to help ease the tension in the car play an icebreaker like two truths and a lie where you reveal two truthful things and one lie then have everyone guess the lie or you can play a game where you tell a story about the meaning behind your name 6 x research source you can also try playing charades or guessing games to kill time while you wait for help in the elevator assure everyone often that help is on the way keep everyone s spirits up in the elevator and reassure them that emergency personnel are on their way to rescue everyone remind everyone that they will likely not be stranded in the elevator for very long and that help is on it s way try to keep everyone calm and

and max force make your own baits you can make effective baits out of a variety of household ingredients try one of these bait recipes mix small equal portions of white flour cocoa oatmeal boric acid and plaster of paris mix 2 teaspoons 10 ml of citrus pulp ¾ teaspoon about 4 ml of brown sugar ½ teaspoon 2 5 ml of corn meal and ¼ teaspoon 1 25 ml of boric acid bait mixtures containing boric acid should be kept out of reach of children and pets place bait stations in identified problem areas bait stations are most effective if set up in areas where cockroaches are known to gather such as cabinets the spaces behind and under appliances and areas where food and moisture are readily available such as bathrooms and kitchens avoid leaving your bait stations out in the open they are more likely to be effective and less likely to be found by pets and children if they are placed under or between appliances in dark corners and inside cabinets if you made your own bait put it in a small container like a shallow bowl or a plastic food storage container lid and place it as you would a commercial bait station use bait gels in small spaces bait gel is ideal for cracks and crevices where

powder duster to puff a thin barely visible film into cracks void spaces around cabinets and underneath appliances re apply your dusts every 3 4 months or as recommended by the manufacturer keep pesticide dusts away from pets and children although these pesticides are relatively safe they can still be harmful be especially cautious when using dusts that contain boric acid do not use these dusts on surfaces where food is prepared or consumed vacuum up roaches when you see them this is a quick and effective way to spot treat your roach problem if you see live roaches droppings or egg

how to get rid of rats in apartment buildings,rats are highly adaptable animals that prefer living near humans for easy access to food and water in addition to spreading disease rats are destructive chewing anything they can find in order to file down their sharp teeth in fact up to 25 of fires with undetermined causes are thought to be caused by rats chewing through electrical wires 1 x research source fortunately there are steps that you can take to get rid of rats if you ve seen them in your apartment building,use plastic snap traps designed for rats trapping rats is the safest way to get rid of them and you can reuse traps as many times as you need to so they re cost efficient you can use wooden rat size snap traps but the plastic versions are easier to set up are less likely to misfire and have a higher kill rate so they re more humane 2 x research source ipm ucanr edu pmg pestnotes pn74106 html you can also try a wooden snap box trap which is better for outside it is similar to a snap trap but has built up walls around it these traps prevent other larger animals from getting killed by the trap 3 x research source bait the traps great bait options include peanut butter raisin bread bacon and candy secure the food to the trigger so that it s hard to remove without triggering the trap some rats will be smart enough to pull off the treat without hitting the trigger so make it as hard as possible to remove the food 4 x research source check the traps frequently to keep them baited use ten or more traps at a time you need to use as many traps at one time as you can since one trap will likely only kill one rat at best you need to use multiple traps if you want to eradicate your rat problem 5 x research source rats are smart so the longer the rats have to observe how the traps work the harder it will be to kill them place the traps in a secure location keep pets and small children safe by placing traps in out of the way locations such as behind walls inside holes created by the rats and under appliances avoid placing them in hallways inside apartments where pets or children live or in the walking areas of basements try a box trap to avoid trapping larger pets like cats or dogs 6 x research source notify residents that you will be setting rat traps tell them where they will be located so that they can monitor their children and pets position traps so that rats must crawl over them look for spots that are a tight squeeze such as between the wall and an appliance rats prefer to travel the same paths over and over so look for their rat droppings or signs of a trail look for rat nests and feces place traps near these areas because the rats will frequent them if you want to set a trap in the ceiling it s okay to set them on top of panels if there are no panels you ll have to go into the attic 7 x research source listen for scurrying and scratching then place the traps nearby most traps should be near a wall or the side of a large appliance rats do not often run in open spaces 8 x research source check the traps often set a schedule for yourself to periodically check the traps you should plan to do so a few times each day while you re trying to take control of the problem clear away dead rats and reset the trigger if you leave dead rats in the traps for long other rats will become cautious around the traps 9 x research source use a poison designed specifically for rats there are a number of different rat poisons on the market but they generally all work by preventing the rats blood from clotting you ll need to read the label on your poison carefully in case there are any specific instructions that you need to follow 10 x research source store the poison on a high shelf away from children and pets and make sure it s clearly labelled if you use poison outside it must be labeled for outdoor use 11 x research source place the poison inside bait boxes bait boxes are small boxes that are designed with small entryways that are only big enough for rats and other small rodents to enter this can help protect larger animals and children from ingesting the poison although you should never place rat poison near areas where children might play some commercial poisons come already contained in bait boxes if the one you choose doesn t you ll need to buy the box separately you can find these wherever pest control products are sold set the bait boxes where you think the rats will be look for secure hidden spots around your apartment building where rats are likely to hide if you see anywhere that has rat trails nests or feces place a bait box there other good places include behind or under appliances walls and pipes or inside a rat hole if you ve found one 12 x research source if you re an apartment manager or maintenance person notify the residents of your apartment complex where you ve placed these poisons check with the manager before you put out poison if you re a resident replace the poison daily for 5 10 days you must continuously feed the rats the poison for at least six days in order for it to be fully effective keep in mind that rats can become tolerant to poisons so don t stop the poison early you may also want to try different poisons if you do more than one treatment 13 x research source rats will not eat spoiled bait so make sure you keep it fresh 14 x research source dispose of extra poison if you have any remaining poison once your rat problem is under control follow the directions on the packaging for disposal don t just throw the poison away as this can harm other people pets or animals if they accidentally come in contact with it skip a month between treatments rats can build a tolerance to the poison so if you have a serious rat problem treat for about a month at a time take a break between treatment cycles to ensure that the rats don t become immune to the poison 15 x research source you can try other treatment methods between poisonings secure the lid to the trash bin make sure that your trash is not a rat buffet rats have trouble chewing through metal or thick plastic bins but they can easily enter a container with an open lid if they make a home in the trash they re more likely to come inside the building as well 16 x research source use safe food habits if you or your tenants improperly store food then rats are more attracted to your building food should not be stored in dark closed areas where rats can be easily active additionally food shouldn t be left sitting out don t store food in the basement this includes pet food encourage good pet food habits amongst your tenants food should not be left out 17 x research source maintain plumbing systems leaky pipes offer a water source and damaged systems offer a place for rats to hide keep them out by doing regular maintenance and fixing any issues immediately 18 x research source repair cracks and holes stop rats from entering the building in the first place by keeping your building and foundation secure rats can squeeze through the tiniest of cracks so even a hole as small as a dime needs to be repaired carefully inspect and repair your walls roof and foundation 19 x research source check close to the ground for freshly dug holes rats sometimes dig near the foundation so that they can crawl through to the inside of the building block the area around pipes and vent openings if your walls or basements have vent openings the rats can enter through the slats or holes while you can t block the opening you can apply wire mesh over the open slats so that the rats cannot enter 20 x research source you can use steel wool to fill in gaps around vents or pipes cover all windows with a wire screen windows provide rats with an open opportunity to enter a building but it s unreasonable to expect people to leave their windows shut at all times instead make sure that every window has an undamaged screen 21 x research source ask tenants to regularly inspect their screens for holes and slits offer to replace screens at no cost to them add door sweeps rats can squeeze under gaps at the bottom of the door if your apartment building has doors that leave a gap between the door and the jam then install a door sweep the door sweep will attach to the bottom of the door providing a seal against outside intruders 22 x research source encourage tenants to carefully inspect deliveries rat can hitchhike in large deliveries especially if food is involved 23 x research source remove any debris from around the building rats love to hide

you use them when starting seedlings soak them in water for 30 seconds 10 x research source place a rapid rooter into each pot make sure that you are placing it so that the hole is facing upwards don t worry if the rapid rooters are too small for the pots you will be filling them with more medium later on 11 x research source add three seeds into the hole in each rapid rooter make sure that you are placing the same type of seed into each hole you are placing three seeds because not all seeds sprout planting more than one at a time ensures that at least one will sprout 12 x research source pay attention to the growing season certain types of plants need to be planted during certain times of the year fill the pots the rest of the way with your desired medium be careful not to cover the hole where you put the seed in however clay pellets are a great choice but you can also use any of the following gravel perlite sand and vermiculite you can even use a combination of two or more mediums 13 x research source coconut fiber is another good choice but you have to be careful so that it doesn t get soggy 14 x research source add a support frame for large plants if needed if you are

from a nursery or you can start them from seeds here are the types of herbs and vegetables that do well in container gardens 1 x research source herbs such as basil mint and thyme you can even plant a bunch in a large planter for a mini garden all salad greens such as collards lettuce mustard and swiss chard harvest only the outer layers to keep your garden looking nice tomatoes eggplants and peppers all do well in summer pots but will need supports or cages cucumbers zucchini and other types of squash will also work cucumbers can also climb a trellis to save space choose a planter with drainage holes at the bottom this is important otherwise the soil will become waterlogged and lead to root rot which can kill your plant your planter can be made out of anything wood plastic clay etc keep in mind however that wood planters don t last for more than a few seasons also if you live in a hot dry climate stay away from terracotta they dry out too quickly and soak up too much moisture if you absolutely must have a terracotta planter get one that is sealed on the inside make sure that the planter is the right shape and size for your plant short wide pots are good for shallow rooted plants such as lettuce while large tall pots are good for vegetables such as a zucchini or pumpkin half size wine barrels also make great containers 2 x research source a 10 inch 25 4 centimeters pot is best for herbs and small plants like strawberries and lettuce a 14 inch 35 56 centimeters pot is great for herbs and salad greens like spinach non heading lettuce and arugula plants an 18 inch 45 72 centimeters pot is good for small vegetables such as broccoli cauliflower eggplant and small peppers it can also hold salad greens and herbs in small bunches a 24 inch 60 96 centimeters pot is best for large vegetables such as cucumber squash and tomatoes it can also hold small bunches of small vegetables and herbs cover the drainage hole with a porous material this will prevent the soil from

lime perlite sphagnum peat moss and vermiculite they will make the soil more expensive but they will ensure the healthiest crops 4 x research source added wetting agents will help the soil stay evenly damp fertilizers are great additions but you will need to add more fertilizer later on it doesn t last forever avoid miracle grow or similar artificially fertilized soils they will only last one season and then they will be lifeless and unusable the next season if you have thirsty plants such as vegetables consider getting a specially formulated soil that retains water 5 x research source fill the pot with soil 1 to 2 inches 2 54 to 5 08 centimeters from the rim make sure to have some extra soil on hand as the soil will compress a little once you water it do not pack or press down on the soil however instead gently tap the pot against the ground or rock it side to side to collapse any air pockets 6 x research source add your plants and fill the spaces with more soil carefully take your plant out of the container it came in and make a hole in the soil large enough to hold the plant s root ball place the plant into the hole and gently pat the soil around it if you are starting your garden from seeds then sow the seeds according to the directions on the seed packet at this point you can also add cage or supports if needed water the soil until water starts to leak out of the bottom of the pot the soil will compress 15 to 20 so you will have to add more soil on top and water again 7 x research source keep doing this until the soil level is 1 to 2 inches 2 54 to 5 08 centimeters from the rim of the pot add some liquid plant food to the water for a nutritional boost 8 x research source take care of your herbs or vegetables water them when the top inch 2 54 centimeters of soil is dry if you find that the soil is drying out too fast add some mulching on top such as fine bark or straw if you live in a humid climate use white pebbles instead they will dry out the soil faster and prevent root rot 9 x research source 10 x research source fertilize only when necessary and be sure to use the right type of fertilizer for your herb or vegetable each plant

shad different types of plants will do better in different types of conditions so you should choose accordingly plants that do well in containers include 11 x research source african daisies and begonias impatiens marigolds and zinnias pansies and petunias choose a large planter with a drain hole at the bottom the planter should be large enough to hold several flowers keep in mind however that the larger the planter is the more difficult it will be to move around avoid terracotta planters if you live in a hot dry climate it will soak up too much water and dry out too fast if you must have a terracotta planter make sure it is sealed on the inside line the bottom of the planter use a porous material such as a coffee filter burlap or window screen or place ½ to 1 inch of gravel on the bottom of the planter this will prevent the soil from falling out while allowing the water to drain through 12 x research source you will also need a dish to place under your planter to catch

how to sublet an apartment,are you heading home for the summer from college relocating temporarily for work moving into a new place before your current lease expires if so subletting also called subleasing your apartment can be a good way to keep a few extra dollars in your pocket it can also be a recipe for disaster however if you do not consider subtenants carefully and abide by the particulars of your lease and legal codes where you live use the following article as a guide to picking the right sublessee keeping your landlord happy and drawing up an effective sublease contract,discuss your interest in subletting with your landlord depending upon the laws where you live your landlord can almost certainly veto your chosen subtenant with reasonable cause he she may also be able to make additional restrictions or perhaps deny your request altogether your best bet for making it an agreeable process for all is to inform and even involve your landlord from the start explain why you want to sublet for how long and what you will look for in a sublessee you may even want to consult your landlord for advice on picking a good tenant or ask if he she knows of any good prospects 1 x research source if your landlord is not on board with the idea be prepared by brushing up on your tenant rights in your jurisdiction take the process of selecting a subtenant seriously you may be itching to get things taken care of so you can head out knowing you won t be paying full rent for an empty apartment but this is a situation where it pays to do things right and could easily cost you a good deal if you don t think of yourself as a landlord or sublandlord your money is on the line based upon the person you choose to occupy the apartment so do your due diligence in the selection process advertise your sublease unless you have a subtenant lined up ahead of time you ll need to spread the word choosing the right channels can help ensure that you find the right candidate placing ads in the local newspaper may seem old fashioned but can still be a viable option especially when combined with a presence on the paper s website popular social media peer to peer transaction and sublease specific sites can be effective avenues especially when seeking a younger clientele refer to this linked wikihow article for some location specific yet generally useful tips in college towns the school s housing office may be able to provide information and assistance 2 x research source putting up fliers in strategic spots around campus can still work as well involve any roommates in the process as long as you re on the lease a roommate cannot really prevent you from subletting your share of the apartment but he or she can sure make it a miserable and possibly costly process if you don t want to go as far as letting them approve of the sublet or the candidate at least make them feel heard and involved in the process they may have good leads on prospective candidates as well so ask 3 x research source vet your prospective subletters carefully don t be over anxious and blindly accept the first person who shows interest think about the apartment as your place which it is to a certain limited extent and consider whether this is the type of person you want to live in your place your landlord likely required some combination of a credit check questionnaire on your finances references and perhaps even a full background check it may seem like overkill to take these steps for a sublet but they certainly can help weed out problematic prospects 4 x research source even if the potential sublessee is an acquaintance risk a bit of awkwardness and request important background information as you would a stranger akin to borrowing money from friends or family keeping the process at a strictly business level will probably pay off if you want to have a full background check done you should probably offer to pay for it you might want to ask your landlord for advice on the process as well as he she likely has ample experience conduct an interview and walk through reading reports and questionnaires is no substitute for meeting someone in person and judging his her suitability as a sublessee doing so in combination with a walk through of the apartment is a sensible way to make sure that tenant subtenant and apartment are all a good fit you can keep the interview more informal if desired but still find ways to ask questions like why are you seeking a temporary living space what kind of job do you have and how much income do you take in do you have a significant other kids or pets that would be in the apartment regularly do you like to host parties or other gatherings 5 x research source during the walk through be specific on the condition of the apartment and especially possible problem areas as a lessee you will be ultimately responsible for damage done by your sublessee so take pictures and be clear that you expect the apartment to remain in the same condition as you will leave it 6 x research source determine your subleasing rights depending upon where you live details such as your landlord s ability to veto a sublet and the amount you are permitted to charge can vary consult the legal particulars in your jurisdiction before moving forward generally speaking in the u s your landlord cannot deny you the ability to sublet but can reject a sublessee for reasonable cause for instance joblessness would be a reasonable criteria while skin color would be unreasonable regardless of where you live it is safe to assume that you will need your landlord s written consent in order to legally sublet your apartment skipping this step may put you at risk for eviction please note the steps in this section build off of how to write a sublease contract which is highly recommended for both legal and practical advice consider a security deposit 7 x expert source nathan miller property management specialist expert interview 15 october 2018 your landlord almost certainly had you provide one when you signed the lease for the apartment in order to cover the cost of any damage or unpaid rent you might leave behind think about doing the same as a sublandlord remember that as the lessee you will be ultimately responsible for damages or unpaid rent by your sublessee so requiring a security deposit provides you with some insurance your ability to collect a security deposit from a sublessee can vary depending upon where you live as can the amount you can require and whether you or the landlord can hold the money again it is wise to consult the laws for renters in your jurisdiction figure out how rent and other bills will be paid ideally you will be able to find someone who will pay you the same amount you pay in rent be warned that charging a subletter more than the rent you pay is usually illegal depending on where you live in reality you can probably hope for 75 80 of what you pay if the apartment is unfurnished a bit more if furnished 8 x research source the monthly rent to be paid is a negotiation between you and the sublessee just as the rent you pay was a negotiation between you and the landlord you will have to decide whether you want the subtenant to pay you directly while you continue to pay the full monthly rent to the landlord or have the subtenant pay the landlord directly while you cover any remaining amount if the subtenant is paying below 100 remember that you are ultimately responsible for unpaid rents to the landlord so consider your options carefully don t forget about utilities as well for a short term sublease you probably won t go through the trouble of switching over the utilities to the subtenant s name so the responsibility for paying utilities if not included in your rent will remain yours you can and should factor in your payment of these charges when you determine how much the subtenant pays in rent each month 9 x research source be clear on acceptable behavior 10 x expert source nathan miller property management specialist expert interview 15 october 2018 if you are not allowed to smoke or have a dog in the apartment then your sublessee must abide by those same rules or you will be in violation of your lease you can add more restrictions than are in your own lease agreement for instance prohibiting a dog even though you can have one but you cannot negate those that are in it here as elsewhere you want to be sure to put the specifics in writing in a legally binding contract see the next section for more on that part of the process write a sublease agreement that is legally binding in your jurisdiction you can find a template for a lease agreement valid in each u s state online 11 x research source use the general

conditions in detail bring out your inner lawyer when drawing up the sublease agreement don t leave any details assumed or unstated put them in writing in the document explicitly detail how much the sublessee will pay each month where the payment should go when the payment is due any penalties for late payments your payment responsibilities if the subtenant is not paying 100 of the rent any security deposit due and terms for recovery and other such particulars refer to the template below for further information have everyone sign and date the sublease agreement you are creating a legally binding contract among three parties yourself your landlord and your subtenant to prevent problems in the future make sure that each party clearly understands the contract before signing if you are

negative relationship people are usually more willing to be accommodating and helpful if they are being treated well no one wants to deal with a rude tenant ask for a lower price than you are willing to pay when negotiating it s important to initially ask for a lower price than you are willing to pay because it s possible the landlord might agree to the deal if they aren t amenable to the initial offer this tactic usually encourages them to name an alternate price and then you can counter with another offer 17 x research source be willing to make concessions one of the keys to successful

19 x research source ask for specific repairs to be made to the apartment or painting to be completed before you move into the unit see if you can pay a lower security deposit or if application fees can be waived request free parking or additional parking ask that utilities be included inquire about free cable or internet service offer to help out the landlord your landlord might be open to

need help when it snows offer to shovel the walkway remember that you have options and do not be afraid to mention them if the landlord knows you are considering other places with lower rents you might have an extra bargaining chip 20 x research source if you have done your research properly you can show the landlord these options if your research reveals that people are paying less for similar properties nearby ask the landlord to explain why there is a difference and see if they might be willing to change their price get the deal in writing if you successfully negotiate a reduced rental rate discounts or amenities make sure these items are written into your lease 21 x research source if your landlord denies this agreement in the future you will have the official lease as proof verbal agreements are not sufficient be willing to walk away if the landlord is uncompromising or unwilling to negotiate this might not be a place you want to live their willingness to negotiate or

how to understand your apartment lease,real estate leases can be intimidating they are often quite long and the language can be confusing as a result many people will sign the lease without actually reading or understanding the entire document landlords can include all sorts of different provisions in the lease once you sign the contract these terms are legally binding it is important to take as much time as you need to understand your apartment lease by doing so you will be much better prepared to handle any conflicts or problems that may arise during your tenancy if you continue to have questions about your lease you should consult with a licensed real estate broker or a real estate attorney in your area,make sure that your name is clearly and correctly recorded in most standard written leases one of the first paragraphs will be the identification of the parties you will need to make sure that you are correctly identified as the tenant if you are renting with a roommate spouse or family you should make sure that everyone who is legally responsible for the rent is named as a tenant 1 x research source you can find a sample rental agreement at masshousinginfo org resources download landlord property_management lease 20form pdf item_id 98098 this template includes general terms that will be acceptable in most states in the sample rental agreement the parties are identified right away in paragraph 1 if you are married and have children the children are not going to be named as tenants because they will not be legally responsible for the contract however you may check to see if the lease contains a paragraph about children or a section to name everyone who will be living in the apartment on the sample rental agreement you would list children in paragraph 7 if you are renting with a roommate you and the roommate should decide how you will share the liability for the lease in most cases the landlord is likely to want to name both individuals as tenants in that way if one tenant defaults or moves away the landlord can still hold the other tenant responsible it is usually in your best interest to have all roommates named on the lease so you don t get stuck with the entire legal responsibility 2 x research source understand who your landlord is the person showing you the apartment and discussing the terms with you may not be the owner of the property for a large apartment building or complex the owner may be a corporation or someone who does not even reside at the property the lease should clearly identify the landlord 3 x research source on the sample rental agreement the landlord is also identified in paragraph 1 look for the identification of a property manager or other responsible person if the owner does not reside at the property to take care of any concerns that might arise you will want to make sure that you know who to contact for any problems look for the name of a property manager or supervisor with a way to contact him or her at any time of day with a problem 4 x research source consider the possibility that your heat could go out or a pipe could burst in the middle of the night you need a telephone number for a person you can contact at any time the sample rental agreement does not contain a notice provision of this sort you may just ask the landlord to provide you with the information or you could attach it as an extra provision see paragraph 21 find the definition of the property you are renting although it may seem obvious the lease must include a clear statement of the property you are renting make sure that the apartment is clearly identified by number or description the identification should include at least a brief description of the apartment such as the number of rooms bathrooms closets and so on 5 x research source in the sample rental agreement paragraph 2 defines the property paragraph 5 then provides a description of fixtures and other property that is included with the apartment a lease in an apartment complex with multiple similar units may will attach a floor plan of the apartment if you are renting a space in a townhouse or single family home for example there may not be an apartment number the lease may just have a description such as second floor apartment at 276 grove street with use of communal bathroom and first floor kitchen know the amount of your rent payments when renting an apartment perhaps the most important detail is the rent this needs to be stated clearly usually in one of the first few paragraphs of a lease contract make sure that the rent stated in the contract matches what you and the landlord have agreed 6 x research source in the sample rental agreement you can find the rent clause at paragraph 4 avoid side agreements sometimes a landlord and tenant might agree to print one thing in the lease contract and then agree privately to something else for example they might agree privately on monthly rent of 1 300 but report a rent of 1 600 so the landlord in the future might be able to rent to someone else more easily for a higher amount you must understand that in case a problem or dispute arises between you and your landlord the court is going to uphold what the written lease says in this example it could be possible for the landlord to turn on you and demand an additional 300 each month agree on the timing and due date for the rent payments the lease should define when your rent payments are due usually payments are to be made by the first of the month although some leases will call for payments on the last day of the month or may set a specific date in the middle of the month 7 x research source paragraph 4 of the sample rental agreement defines both the amount of the rent payments and the due dates read any provisions about a grace period for late payments you should always get your rent paid by the due date however most leases will include a provision for a grace period with this if you make your payment within 5 10 or sometimes as many as 15 days late the landlord will accept the payment and take no action against you 8 x research source the sample rental agreement says nothing about late payments on one hand this is beneficial to the tenant because it limits the landlord s ability to charge a late fee on the other hand you are not protected by a grace period and the landlord could just declare you in default of the contract on the first day that you are late it would be a good idea to negotiate for a grace period and add that to the lease be careful about relying on the grace period even though the landlord may not impose a penalty or take any action against you for a payment that is only a couple days late he or she may still take note of the fact that the payment is late if you need a referral from the landlord to move to another apartment someday it will not serve you well if the referral says that you made every payment late understand the penalties for any late payments in the same provision about rent payments you should find an explanation of the landlord s right in case your payments are late beyond the grace period this may range from a small penalty fee to possible eviction 9 x research source state laws often regulate the amount a landlord may charge as a penalty if you believe that the lease allows a penalty that seems unreasonable you should check with a real estate lawyer or local housing board 10 x research source look for any statements about the landlord s right to increase the rent the lease should define any changes that are planned in your rent or describe when and to what extent the landlord may increase the rent for example if you sign a multi year lease it would be reasonable to include a provision that allows the landlord to increase the rent at the end of each year by a limited percentage 11 x research source some state laws limit rent increases while other states do not if the lease does not address the issue of a rent increase then the landlord must honor the rent amount for the duration of the lease if the lease expires or reverts to a month to month lease then the landlord would be entitled to issue an increase the sample rental agreement says nothing about rent increases be sure that the start and end dates are clearly stated the lease should clearly identify the first and last dates of your tenancy usually this will be planned to begin on the first of a month and to end on the last of a month although you and the landlord can agree to any start and end dates that you wish if you need to move in before the first of the month you may be able to negotiate with the landlord for an earlier state date if the property is empty anyway and is ready for you the landlord might be willing to let you move in early and pro rate the rent for a few days look for a statement about the period of the lease apartment leases usually last for either a year or are month to month some may also be multi year leases these different lease types have different pros and cons which you will want to consider in negotiating your agreement 12 x research source an annual lease lasts for one year and you and the landlord would have the right to negotiate a new lease at the end of that year this provides you security for a year that you have a home but has the flexibility of being able to move out at the end of that time if you wish a multi year lease lasts for usually two or three years although some residential leases run even longer in some high end apartment complexes where residents tend to be more stable a multi year lease may be more common a month to month lease provides the most flexibility but the least security you have the ability to give notice at almost any time that you are moving out as long as you finish out the month if your plans are unstable this may be the lease you want however a landlord also has the right to terminate the agreement on short notice and have you move out the landlord also has more opportunity to increase your rent in a month to month lease the sample rental agreement defines the term of the lease in paragraph 3 however if you read it closely the language is not very clearly written it is unclear whether the lease is intended to be a month to month or an annual lease if the starting and ending dates are a year apart that would imply an annual lease which reverts to a month to month lease at the end of the year check for the notice requirements to renew the lease in almost every jurisdiction you do not need to do anything to remain in a month to month lease however you should read the contract carefully to understand what you must do if you wish to renew an annual lease or a multi year lease usually you will need to notify your landlord at least 30 or 60 days before the original expiration date of the lease that will give you and the landlord time to negotiate any new terms for a revised lease some leases will renew automatically for an additional year unless you notify the landlord that you are leaving 13 x research source in the sample rental agreement when the initial term of the lease expires the lease will continue as a month to month lease this is defined in paragraph 3 read the details about what you or your landlord must do to terminate the lease early every lease should contain instructions about early termination this will apply to both the tenant and the landlord read the provisions to find out how much notice you must provide if you wish to leave and how much notice the landlord must provide if he or she wants you to leave early early termination by the landlord may not be allowed in many places 14 x research source this notice must usually be provided in writing to a certain person at a particular address pay attention to these details in the sample rental agreement early termination is addressed in paragraph 20 don t be confused by paragraph 16 which is called termination the provisions of paragraph 16 focus on the tenant s departure from the unit at the regular end of the lease find out who is responsible for paying the utilities in addition to rent paying for the utilities can be one of your greatest expenses if the utilities are included in the rent this can represent a great savings you need to make sure that the lease defines which utilities are included with the rent and which ones are not 15 x research source the sample rental agreement provides a good example of a way to spell out the responsibilities for utility payments in paragraph 9 if you are responsible for paying for certain utilities find out if you must use certain vendors or if you may shop around for better prices make sure the lease clearly describes the maintenance responsibilities you need to understand which maintenance tasks are your responsibility and which are the landlord s in general the tenant will be responsible for minor repairs within the apartment and the landlord will take care of more extensive work plumbing heating 16 x research source if you have any question about what you might be responsible for doing you should ask and have it clarified in the lease according to the sample rental agreement the landlord will provide most of the maintenance services paragraph 18 additional provisions require the tenant to make regular repairs to minor damage paragraph 11 and to maintain the property in a regularly neat and habitable condition paragraph 9 be sure the lease clearly describes any services that are included with the lease anything that the landlord described when you were deciding on the apartment should be included in the lease agreement this may be anything from available laundry facilities to use of a swimming pool to trash removal if something was represented that is important to you make sure that it is included in the lease 17 x research source agree on the amount of the security deposit a standard part of any lease agreement is the security deposit for most leases the security deposit will be equal to one month s rent although different amounts can be negotiated the security deposit is an amount that you must pay your landlord which he or she will keep until you leave the lease should contain the rules about the landlord s handling of the security deposit in a secure account and should explain when the landlord must return it to you 18 x research source the sample rental agreement defines the security deposit in paragraph 6 understand the conditions that would allow your landlord to keep your security deposit the lease needs to contain provisions that address when the landlord is allowed to keep your security deposit usually this will be for damage to the apartment or for nonpayment of rent according to many standard leases the landlord must provide the tenant with written notice if he or she intends to keep any part of the security deposit with an detailed explanation of the reason in many cases the security deposit is to be kept in an interest bearing account for the duration of your tenancy ask your landlord about this if you do not see it in the lease agreement review the details about the return of your security deposit the contract should explain when you are entitled to receive your security deposit usually this will be some time after you leave the apartment with a reasonable amount of time for the landlord to get in and inspect and clean behind you be sure that the lease contains your entire agreement any details that are important to you must be included in the written lease agreement if they are not included you need to have them added if you and your landlord ever have a dispute about your lease and need to go to court a judge is going to interpret the written lease as it is it will not help for you to tell the judge but the landlord said unless you can prove it somehow no matter how nice your landlord may seem when you are moving in you must have every part of your agreement in writing the landlord may smile and tell you that of course dogs are allowed but if you don t put that in writing he could change his mind and tell you to get rid of your great dane after two months add any documents or additional pages for terms that are not already included in the lease this may include such issues as smoking subleasing or allowing pets in the apartment many standard leases are just form agreements to personalize them you and your landlord may type additional agreements and attach them if you do this make sure that the attachments are identified and referred to as part of the original lease 19 x research source for example a common paragraph toward the end of the lease may be labeled additional agreements or something similar this will be the place for you to identify the name of any added documents additional provisions are referenced in the sample rental agreement in paragraph 21 although that paragraph does not include space to define any attachments it would be a good idea to name any attachments even in the margin of the page and have both parties to the lease initial the addition then attach the extra page or pages sign or initial and date any attached pages any added agreements must be separately signed or initialed by the parties to the original lease you should also date any attachments preferably with the same date as the lease agreement itself these additions are to be part of the original agreement so they should contain the same formalities as the original agreement and should match the original as much as possible 20 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to find an apartment in paris,relocating to paris can seem like a daunting task for expatriates you ve probably already heard the list of complaints over priced properties landlords who can t speak english no long term rentals for expatriates while its true that finding a rental in paris is notoriously difficult there are certain steps you can take to simplify the process and increase your chances for success,familiarize yourself with parisian geography understanding the area itself can help you make a choice about where the best place will be for you to settle the city of paris is located in the central northern quarter of france it covers 4 638 square miles and has over twelve million inhabitants making it the most populous city in france 1 x research source paris is roughly oval shaped and is divided into twenty arrondissements or municipalities which form a clockwise spiral arrondissement 1 is located in the center and spirals out from there each arrondissement has its own pros and cons related to population density property prices attractions safety and culture the seine river cuts through the center and bottom half of paris get to know the market the prices in each area differ dramatically so you need to familiarize yourself with the various districts in order to begin your search the cheapest arrondissement is 19 with average rental prices of 23 7 euros per square meter about 26 us dollars the most expensive is 6 with average rental prices of 37 9 per square meter about 42 us dollars prices also differ depending on whether you want a furnished or unfurnished apartment for example furnished rentals in central paris range from 30 40 per square meter about 34 45 us dollars while unfurnished rentals cost approximately 27 37 per square meter about 30 41 us dollars start networking using social media in particular is a great way to learn a lot about the area as well as make connections with others who can help you track down apartment leads join facebook and other social networking groups for expats you can ask questions about the area and get advice as well as keeping an eye out for postings regarding open apartments be sure you have friended anyone you know in france and post a status asking anyone to let you know if they have leads to open apartments it is not uncommon for landlords to post on their own social media channel rather than paying to advertise their apartments so a good network can go a long way in helping you find an open place 2 x research source budget for your rent your personal income and expenses will determine how expensive of an apartment you can afford which will determine which arrondissements are within your budget in order to save time and energy determine how far your budget can go before you start researching spaces one helpful formula to keep in mind is monthly rent monthly salary x 1 3 in general landlords in paris and other developed nations will evaluate potential tenants by looking at their monthly salary your rent should be no more than 1 3 of your salary once you know your budget for your apartment consider which arrondissement meets your needs best plan for your needs it makes sense to start looking around where you ll be working or going to school but you should also keep in mind other personal or family needs that might influence where you choose to live the 1st arrondissement is tempting because its the one most foreigners are most familiar with it boasts many major tourist attractions but that also makes it expensive and overcrowded with tourists 3 x research source the 3rd and 4th arrondissements are similar to soho in manhattan with lots of shopping bistros and nightlife 4 x research source the 8th is pricey and luxurious and is where oprah winfrey tends to stay when she visits paris so consider whether this not only fits your budget but your lifestyle 5 x research source the 14th and 16th are known as quiet residential areas making both nice choices for a family or people not interested in the young edgy scene in many other arrondissements 6 x research source keep an open mind regarding location while you might be tempted to only look in the neighborhood you ll be working don t restrict yourself to living only within walking distance of your office paris has one of the best public transport networks in the world with buses trams taxis rail bicycle and even boats available to get you where you need to go many expatriates seem to settle in the 7th 8th 15th and 16th arrondissements but you shouldn t let that deter you from exploring others each of the 20 arrondissements offer distinct draws so do your research on each one to determine which is best for you and your family if you have one time it right depending on when you sign a lease you may spend more or less money than you would otherwise spend many people move to paris in the fall particularly students beginning a new semester in university and consequently there are less apartments to choose from and the prices are higher 7 x research source choose your criteria it s important to have a sense of your wants and your dealbreakers because the housing market is quite limited in paris try to keep your dealbreakers list very short consider what you actually need in an apartment versus what you want unless you plan to eat out every day a functional kitchen is important but you don t need granite countertops if you work from home or have small children a quiet building may be essential try to keep an open mind about space properties in paris are very small and very expensive you are very unlikely to find a large and spacious apartment find open properties that fit your requirements the paris rental market is known for being very competitive so you have to know where to look for open properties and be ready to make a move as soon as one becomes available that fits your needs there are many rental agencies you can register with but they are notoriously expensive and unreliable only use one if you have the money to spare 8 x research source if you are in france you can often find good places by watching postings on local coffee shop notice boards notice boards in anglo centers like shakespeare co or the american church in paris or in local magazines like fusac 9 x research source the most popular website for apartment listings is

mouth is often the best way to find a place that fits your requirements if you are a student looking for a small studio network with students at local universities so that you can be notified if a space becomes available otherwise find facebook groups and other online communities for expats where people will often post about available spaces visit as many apartments as you can as soon as you can its important that you show up to actually view apartments which will tell you a lot about the area and living situation and also give you an advantage over other renters if you see an advertisement for an apartment that seems remotely acceptable call right away and schedule an appointment to view it 11 x research source housing discrimination in paris is illegal that is refusal to rent to non french renters as well as discrimination on other bases like gender religion or race so most landlords prefer to rent to the first person who wants an open apartment in order to avoid being accused of discrimination 12 x research source that means if you show up first and make an offer you are more likely to get to sign a lease come prepared when you visit an apartment even if you don t know for sure that you ll love it come prepared with the proper paperwork known as your dossier you will give this paperwork to the landlord immediately after viewing the apartment if you love it and he or she will begin the process of determining if you are an acceptable tenant your dossier consists of a copy of your passport and visa if you re not from the european union your last three pay check stubs or a contract that states your salary and for most places a signed letter from a french resident who will act as your guarantor along with their payslip 13 x research source if you don t know any french residents who can act as guarantor but have already secured a job often your employer will sign as your guarantor if not you can try using a rental agency called paris attitude which is english speaking and only lists apartments that do not require a french guarantor otherwise though avoid using agencies which tend to charge exorbitant prices 14 x research source be aware that you will be very unlikely to be able to negotiate a lower rent price since spaces are in such high demand and you will need two months rent as security upon signing a contract 15 x research

how to rent an apartment in los angeles,different people have different priorities and interests when moving into an apartment in los angeles although there are many aspects and details to evaluate before choosing your new residence there are certain factors that make it to our list of the top ten things you should look for when renting an apartment in los angeles,choose the approximate location la is a huge city especially in a city as large as los angeles your apartment s proximity to your work or school needs to be taken into consideration assessing the amount of time you will regularly sit in traffic on your daily commute to and from work or school or wherever you plan to go regularly should be calculated a good way of determining if a location is good for you is by doing a trial run by simulating your commute drive from your prospective apartment to work as you would as if you had already moved in make sure to simulate the situation as realistically as possible driving at 8 45 am is a completely different scenario than driving two hours later this test drive will give you a realistic idea of what your daily commute will be like and how bearable or unbearable it will be everyone puts a different value on their time for some it may make more sense to live closer to work at the expense of higher monthly rent for others it is sensible to have a long commute and spend less money on rent every month paying more money for closer proximity to work in order to avoid traffic is a clear illustration of the popular saying that real estate is based on three things location location location check for basic cleanliness look at the common areas of the apartment building such as the laundry area and the parking garage and see how the apartment community members take care of their surroundings this will show you not only about the building that you will be moving into but also it will show you how the tenants potentially your future neighbors treat their homes drive around and look at the neighborhood look at your surrounding areas that are in comfortable walking distance check out the nearby restaurants and shops as well as the parks and community centers in the area to determine if you will enjoy the people and the environment in your new surrounding find out the amenities available amenities may include gyms pools coffee shops or various other service facilities note that amenities available to tenants are not necessarily free of charge see who the neighbors are who lives in the building how many units are there in the complex do the neighboring people seem like the type you will get along with will their lifestyles interfere with yours are they child friendly are they pet friendly are they safe people to live next to remember that the people that you see when you look at an apartment are strangers today but may become best friends or business partners in the future make sure that you move into an apartment that has a reputable and proficient management team you do not want to lease an apartment that has problems that your management team will not take care of find out the school district if you have children choosing an area to live that is within the parameters of a good school is imperative consider the fact that your child will be going to school with other children in your school district determine the building age the older a building gets the more problems you potentially will encounter it is unreasonable to expect an old building to be as fit as a brand new building find out if your apartment has an on site apartment manager or perhaps a full on site management team note that california code of regulations title 25 article 5 section 42 dictates that if a residential building has 16 units or more there must be an on site manager if the owner of the property violates this code it speaks volumes for their respect for the law and to their tenants which may foreshadow further violations that the owner may make in the future research the pet policy if you have pets you need to ensure that the apartment complex you are interested in allows your pet some apartment communities boast pet friendly environments while others do not allow pets at all some policies allow for only cats or dogs of certain sizes or breeds therefore do not sign a lease without verifying that you are allowed to have your furry friend live with you,Home-and-Garden

how to choose between a college dorm or apartment,living away from home can be exciting you will have a lot of new freedom and responsibility dorm life can be a great way to meet new friends but you may want to move out of the dorm eventually you may also want to start off college living off campus when deciding between the dorm and an apartment think about your finances your social life and your personal needs,start by comparing the cost of rent when you begin to consider your finances see if there s a major difference in rent costs between an apartment and the dorm oftentimes the cost of rent alone is cheaper off campus but don t always assume the rent of off campus housing will be cheaper than the dorm some apartments can be rather expensive the monthly rent for a dorm may be quite high and may be almost the same level of some apartments 1 x research source if you do not currently have an apartment lined up you can browse listings online to try and get a general sense of what the price range tends to be in the area you should be able to find out how much a dorm costs on your university s website write down a rough range of costs of apartments versus campus housing for example monthly dorm rent is 900 per month while the average rent in an apartment is 550 remember you do not have to pay rent alone usually you will end up having roommates when figuring out your rent responsibilities consider if you ll be splitting the rent with a roommate having roommates will ensure you will be living in a higher quality apartment you may have to make the decision would you rather live in a cheaper lower quality apartment and be able to pay the rent alone or you rather live in a higher quality apartment and deal with roommates factor in utility payments rent is only one of many expenses to consider while rent may be cheaper you want to make sure you look at all your options one advantage of dorm life is that many expenses are taken care of things like internet heat water and other utilities may be covered in the dorms but not off campus 2 x research source many apartments do cover basic utilities such as water and heat and that might be something to check into be aware that the rent may be more expensive with apartments that cover more utilities than with apartments that do not do any apartments pay utilities if not you will end up having to pay things like a water bill a heating bill and an electricity bill if you know anyone living off campus ask them about how much they pay for utilities you will also have to contact an internet or cable company to set up your internet see how much internet and cable cost per month through local providers many apartments may provide free wi fi internet with the rent and some may even provide a free basic cable subscription for better quality internet access with better privacy security etc and more premium cable tv options you are wise to provide your own cable and internet access add how much you ll be paying for utilities to your monthly rent for example say you ll pay about 80 a month in things like water and gas and 40 a month for internet remember the hypothetical average rent is 550 now the cost of living per month is 670 off campus versus 900 on campus look into the cost of food groceries are probably the biggest extra expense when it comes to living off campus you will no longer have a meal plan provided by your college so you ll have to prepare your own food 4 x research source think about how much you will reasonably spend on groceries will you spend about 60 a week add this to your running total for off campus expenses now you re looking at around 910 a month keep in mind you may be able to stay on your campus s meal plan for a fee if you don t like cooking for yourself see how much a meal plan costs per month think about free amenities in addition the perk of utilities being covered does your dorm offer free amenities for example maybe your dorm has a gym in the building are there any on campus amenities only open to students who live in the dorm 5 x research source if you don t use a lot of your dorm or university s amenities this may not be a big deal for you however say you go to the gym every day losing your gym pass could cause problems check to see how you would go about replacing any amenities you lose for example look into gym memberships is there anything in your price range maybe you find something for 40 a month add that to the 910 total of rent and utilities the cost off campus is now roughly 950 compare the final costs if your dorm is hypothetically 900 a month it s slightly cheaper to live in the dorm in this scenario however this may not necessarily be the case given the factors in your area remember cost is only one factor to consider the impact on your social life and academic responsibility should also be taken into account think about meeting new people are you a freshman or a sophomore if so now may not be the best time to move off campus the dorms provide you with a lot of opportunities for socialization especially early on in college in the dorms you re living with many different students your age people may be eager to make new friends there may be get togethers hosted by your dorm where you ll have an opportunity to meet fellow students you will also eat in the cafeteria with other students allowing you to bond over food if you re an older student however you may already have an established friend group if you feel confident you will still see your friends off campus you probably won t miss out on much by leaving the dorms if anything you ll get the chance to experience something new off campus apartments are open to the general public so you are going to be living with people of all ages there will be families with children elderly and people working overnight jobs so you might want to think twice before you have guests over partying and so forth consider how often you entertain do you like having get togethers if you re the type to host things like game nights movie nights and other festivities you may want to consider an off campus move dorm rooms are generally small and may not leave you enough room to have guests 6 x research source there are also frequently more restrictions in dorms than apartments entertaining may be more relaxing if you re living off campus if you live off campus you will have to follow the rules laws of the local community and apartment complex that you reside in look at your current social circle older students may already have a large social circle if you re a junior or a senior now may be a good time to try off campus living you have likely met people through the dorms which has led to other friendships 7 x research source many people enjoy living off campus once they feel socially secure if you feel like you have a solid social circle off campus life may work for you if you re a freshman you may feel you have a solid social circle maybe you have a lot of high school friends attending your school however keep in mind college is traditionally seen as a chance to branch out and make new friends living off campus may limit your opportunity to meet new people weigh your need for privacy the dorm can be great for making friends and socializing but there is a real lack of privacy sharing small living quarters with a roommate can cause stress if you re someone who values your alone time an apartment may be a better option you may be able to get your own room at an apartment or at least get more living space 8 x research source if you have a mental health issue like social anxiety disorder living in a dorm can be particularly stressful it may be best to seek out a quiet apartment you can also look into a single room in a dorm while these may be more expensive it s a good in between you are able to get the social experience of living in the dorm while still having your own space factor in the freedom of apartment life if you value personal freedom an apartment may be better for you there s a lot more freedom in apartment life 9 x research source as there are less rooms and people noise may not carry as easily in an apartment you will be able to play music and video games and watch television without as much fear of disturbing someone but be careful with even off campus apartments especially with apartments with young children and or elderly many apartments have quiet hours to let the residents sleep and there are people that like to go to bed early take naps or simply have peace and quiet dorms often have strict rules you may for example have to sign in overnight visitors you may also have to sign in when coming back to the dorm late in an apartment you will not have these restrictions most dorms do not allow pets but many apartments do allow having pets if you miss having your pet while in college you can consider living off campus having a pet will be especially helpful if you are living alone off campus when there are not as many peers consider whether you need a resident adviser a resident adviser called resident mentor at some schools provides support and guidance to students if you re struggling with something personal or academic you can always ask your resident mentor for help 10 x research source if you re prone to stress you may have a greater need for a resident mentor you may feel better living somewhere where you have someone to rely on for support however not everyone feels they need a resident mentor if you prefer managing stress on your own or seeking support from friends or family members a resident mentor may not be necessary be honest about your personal responsibility students who live in dorms often do better academically it s easier to stay on task with less distractions if you re on campus you may also have easier access to places like the library 11 x research source be honest with yourself are you a responsible person will you be able to get to classes on time if you live off campus will you be able to stay on track with your homework with the freedom of off campus life if you re generally the responsible type living off campus will still be an adjustment however if you tend to finish assignments on time and have a solid work ethic you have a good chance of staying on track off campus think about your access to campus amenities if you move off campus you may be farther away from things like libraries resource centers and similar buildings if it is more difficult to run to the library for example you may find you re doing it less often however if you are living off campus you might have more entertainment and socialization options out in the community that would be harder to access while on campus such as movie theaters restaurants or shopping these options may be more expensive but you can sometimes get community discounts if you have a campus id a lot of this will depend on where apartments tend to be located in your area if you re attending school in a college town apartments may tend to be close to campus this would make this less of an issue you should also factor in the cost of parking and gas if you end up needing to drive to certain locations the costs can add up each month you may also consider using public transportation to get to and from college classes think about distractions the freedom of an apartment can be great you can have guests over whenever you want and are generally able to make more noise however this can prove to be a distraction in the dorm there may be things like quiet hours quiet hours are also very common in apartments as well you also will not be able to have a lot of people over at once 12 x research source if you re the responsible type you may be able to better cope with distractions however it will always be an adjustment if you decide to live off campus be prepared to work extra hard to stay on track it s okay if you think you cannot handle the responsibility many students live on campus for all four years remember the most important thing about college is learning,Home-and-Garden
how to furnish your first college dorm or apartment on a budget,as any college student can report money can be tight you ll need to be creative and smart to furnish your apartment or dorm as inexpensively as possible here are some tips to picking up some essential living items,find out what you need start with things that you absolutely need for your dorm room colleges usually have an orientation pack that lists clearly what you will need for example bedding such as sheets pillows blankets mattress protectors what is prohibited many schools do not allow hot pots toaster ovens candles space heaters and the like this too will likely be stated very clearly what do upperclassmen recommend orientation is a good time to ask people familiar with campus what may not be absolutely necessary but recommended if not usually the first week is good too this may include dorm sized refrigerators fans especially in warmer climates lamps small microwaves small area carpets and so on with apartments generally you will need to provide furniture this includes beds dressers couches and things like tv sets however be sure to ask if there is any furniture that comes with the apartment occasionally an apartment may have some furniture often because the last tenant left it behind sometimes if you ask the tenant that is leaving especially if for a faraway place they may leave you something or for a high discount be careful of back to school advertising retail stores will try to convince you that you need items that may be completely unnecessary for instance you may not have any room for an oversized beanbag chair in your small dorm make a list of items that you will need a list of common items to get you thinking can be found below in the things you ll need section consider the fact that space will undoubtedly be limited apartment living may require more use your judgment and common sense put the list in order of importance also consider how long you will be there a person spending one semester at a special program will likely need less than someone spending a school year on campus remember that less brought in the easier to pack and move out if you live on campus you will have to move out all your things in 9 months too much stuff also can be problematic if you have to take a bus or airplane home also college students tend to move frequently so it makes sense to keep your household goods light sometimes it makes sense to make a running list as you go as you settle into a space you tend to figure out what you need what size and so on it can also help you trigger your memory when you go shopping or at a garage sale or whatnot shops are usually readily available while some colleges are in remote places with hard to reach shopping centers most will have retail places to buy things you need usually not everything has to be bought immediately even if there are few stores available online shopping can make many things available to purchase plan for the short term most of the items you will need to get through college or for your first apartment do not need to last more than a few years at best while you should always try to choose items of decent quality the furnishing of your first place will likely not be the best feel free to purchase cheap plastic items such as plastic drawers foldable tables futons or even patio furniture as an inexpensive way to to fulfill your needs however be careful not to go with really low quality furniture an old lumpy futon will likely hurt your back a plastic drawer set that never really works properly and breaks before winter break is no bargain do not get too fussy the things you use during the college years tend to be used for a few years at best and not tend to be as nice as what you may have during your career you may be used to your parent s house which will have things they have accumulated over the years but for now you will be unlikely to have a matching bedroom set or anything resembling fine furnishings ask relatives or neighbors if they have any items that you can use you may be surprised how many people have attics and drawers full of unused or unwanted items in need of a good home you may be doing them a favor by taking it off their hands start asking over the summer so they can keep their eyes open and set things aside be careful about taking items from the family home you do not want to come off as a greedy scavenger if your father is thinking of upgrading the television that may be an opportunity to discuss taking the old one to your apartment however do not expect to be given things that are being used in the home if your loved ones want to throw a party or give gifts to celebrate your graduation request supplies for college or your apartment large chain stores like target and bed bath beyond offer registries do not make lavish requests it is one thing to ask for a dorm sized refrigerator but a plasma tv may seem greedy by keeping it simple and reasonable people will appreciate your plight and feel more inclined to help you out you must send thank you notes to everyone who gives you a gift be grateful check the curb many people toss things instead of trying to sell or donate this is common especially when people move on trash day or the day of or after a yard sale of course only get items that can be washed and sanitized problems with mold bed bugs and basic cleanliness can be an issue for the best stuff travel to more affluent areas people with extra money to spend often toss out new and like new items just because they have gone out of style recycling centers thrift shops and other second hand stores in such regions are also excellent resources head to the local landfill or recycling center in many landfills there is a separate building where people can drop off lightly used furniture and other house items which is usually categorized as too good to throw out spring cleaning for county residents can mean a new couch for your apartment or a computer station for the dorm at no cost to you except energy to load the stuff into your vehicle be sure to visit these places frequently as a full shed one morning can be bone dry the next look for other kinds of free giveaways check on websites such as craigslist org or freecycle very often people will post items which is free for the asking be extremely careful of bedbugs unfortunately infestations can be commonplace in items such as mattresses easy chairs and couches curbside items such as these should be approached with extreme caution try thrift stores they are often affiliated with a charity not only can you get cheap goods the money you spend goes towards helping the charity check back often as their supply changes daily to weekly you can easily pick up pots pans bowls and utensils for 1 or less also watch for church sales many older churchgoers unload great items to be sold super cheap at these sales visit dollar stores in your neighborhood these are a great place to buy mops brooms kitchen items and cleansers also try to pick up your toilet brushes and toilet plungers here those are two items you do not want to get used dollar stores are also great places to buy picture frames photographs make great personal and inexpensive decorations dollar stores are also typically excellent for a wealth of household items such as whiteboards notepads calendars oven mitts soap dishes and more shop local yard sales yard sales are often great resources for the thrifty young adult these will almost always be on the weekend especially saturday and tend to start early and wrap up around 3 p m ask the person running the yard sale for items you are specifically looking for as they may be hidden or the seller might suddenly remember there is one that can be sold if the items are too pricey or can be found cheaper elsewhere you should wait some people price garage sale items too high if so forgo the yard sale or try again in mid afternoon when the prices may drop another tip is to quietly speak with the yard sale host explain that you are going off to college and are trying to find certain items give them your number and tell them you would be happy to take items off their hands should they not sell by the end of the day most people would rather give items to a friendly personable needy student than set them on the curb or throw it out check auction listings many people put their unused items into storage and sometimes they forget to pay the storage bill those items are put up for auction you may be able to stock up for just a few bucks most people try to get their hands on the treasures at auctions so the basics can be picked up super cheap check with your local antique shops antique stores are not all fancy old items surprisingly antique stores often sell items at a price lower than new furniture although the term is antique store these stores often happily sell what is actually vintage and sometimes not even that old frankly they will sell whatever they think they may make a profit on old and valuable or not they often have many decorative items as well you can often bargain with them to receive a discount visit your university s surplus store they often will offer used office furniture lamps tools and the like at reasonable prices visit your university s loan closet some colleges operate loan closets on an honor basis where you can get stuff for free if you agree to return it and bring more stuff as soon as you do not need it anymore sometimes access to loan closets is restricted to people with special needs international students students of a certain department or school or those in particular need such as a student who comes from an extremely impoverished background however it never hurts to ask paint or apply funky finishes to make something look more your style slipcovers are available at discount stores or you can use sheets in a pinch be creative and have fun with it wrap and pack breakable objects carefully you do not want to end up at school with a bunch of broken dishes and have to start all over be sure to label the boxes shop for food while you are still at home of course this tends to work if you are driving to school not if you are flying cross country stock up on canned items like soups powdered drink mixes tuna and ravioli boxed mixes and items that won t crush or go bad don t forget salt pepper mustard ketchup sugar sweetener non dairy powder coffee creamer cooking spray popcorn cans of peanuts etc ask before taking parents tend to be fine about sending off their college bound student with food some parents will insist however this should not be a surprise nor do you simply take another person s food without asking even your parents do not open anything that requires refrigeration before you leave for your new digs many jarred products are safe at room temperature until opened like mayonnaise and salad dressings talk to your parents about adding a few items to each week s grocery list if you start early you can have a great supply of food to last you while at school ask your parents about making a trip to the local discount shopping club and pick up some food in bulk condiments such as salt and pepper are probably in good supply at your parent s house spices are expensive and you won t go through it quickly so ask your family to borrow from their supplies,Home-and-Garden
how to keep your college apartment clean,living with four or more strangers comes with its fair share of trials but living in filth doesn t have to be one of them although you might get stuck with messy roommates it is easy to keep an apartment spic and span so you don t end up paying for it later keeping these top 8 areas clean will give you the best chance of getting your cleaning deposit back at the end of the year,most ovens have a self cleaning setting if your oven doesn t have this simply turn the oven to bake at the highest temperature possible and leave it on for about an hour after the oven is cool remove the racks and cover all surfaces with oven cleaner use the whole can if you need to it will be easier to clean and you probably won t use the cleaner again until next semester anyway shut the oven door and leave the room while the fumes disperse let the cleaner sit for a few minutes and then go back to wipe out the oven most of the black stuff that has been covering your oven all semester should come off pretty easy if not the only thing you can do is grab the steel wool and add in extra elbow grease the easiest way to clean blinds is to give them a shower take them off the wall and simply hose them off either outside or in your bathtub this will clean your blinds faster and easier than any dusting technique clean the counters clear everything off the counter smother them in soft scrub then rinse those babies until they sparkle bathtubs soft scrub here again those scrubbing bubbles can work as hard as they can but it still won t get it as clean as a bleach based cleaner cover the entire tub in soft scrub and then leave the room and do something else come back 15 or 20 minutes later and spray the tub down get your faucets and appliances to shine like new with a clean soft dry cloth this will get rid of all your water spots but make sure to do this step last window cleaners are for windows the best trick for mirrors is warm water and circles use a clean soft cloth damp with warm water scrub in circles and follow immediately with a dry towel presto you can see yourself in your mirror again the stove top itself can be cleaned with any kitchen cleaner but the metal tins in the burners are cheap enough that if they are really bad i recommend replacing them rather than wasting the time cleaning them to tackle the fridge take everything out wipe everything down with a kitchen cleaner take out the drawers and clean them with dish soap these can actually go in a dishwasher if they ll fit don t forget to do the same to the freezer roommates are hard to keep clean and they probably won t appreciate if you re constantly hovering over them to give them a coaster or vacuum while they watch a movie work with your roommates and not against them,Home-and-Garden

how to choose an apartment building,choosing an apartment building to live in can be a hard decision once you find a few apartments that you like you ll need to choose among them by comparing the buildings in which they are located assessing an apartment building s location amenities and a few other features can help you pick out a great apartment of course different people are looking for different types of apartments so there s no such thing as a perfect building figure out what you re looking for most in your apartment building and evaluate them accordingly,find out if the apartment building provides parking if you rent in an urban area having access to parking is an important factor the building may provide a private lot for its residents or may have reserved parking spaces for each individual apartment if not look into the availability of street parking parking several blocks and walking to get to your building works fine during the summer but can become a major hassle on cold winter nights 1 x research source if you re not certain ask the building manager where most residents park or how often the parking lot fills up find out how close the building is to public transportation hubs if you don t have your own vehicle and are going to rely on public transit to get around you ll want your apartment to be located less than 1 2 mile 0 80 km from a bus stop drive through the neighborhood that the apartment is in and see if you spot bus stops or look online at the city s public transit map and see where the closest stop is relative to a potential apartment building that you re scoping out 2 x research source if you have your own car this will be less of an issue but it s still worth knowing where the bus stops are in case you need to hop a bus one day consider your commute if you have to spend a lot of time on the road before you select an apartment building to live in find out how close it is to your place of employment having a short commute is nice so finding a place that s within a 10 or 15 minute drive would be ideal if you own your own vehicle and commute more than 30 minutes each day you ll end up spending a large portion of your monthly budget on gas or if you take the bus to your job you could end up commuting for several hours a day if your apartment building is far from your workplace 3 x research source driving a long distance to your job or being stuck in rush hour traffic will leave you less time to enjoy your apartment look for a building that offers the amenities you re looking for apartment buildings can vary widely in the type of amenities and perks that they offer to their residents when you re evaluating apartment buildings figure out which amenities you would like to have and choose a building accordingly for example you may feel that an in apartment washing machine is mandatory but an on site gym isn t something you need ask the property manager if the building offers perks like 4 x research source laundry machines in the rooms or on site laundry facilities on site weight room or gym pool or sauna event space find an apartment building that s within your monthly budget look at an apartment complex s website to find their rental rates or call and speak with the apartment manager if the rates aren t online as a rule of thumb you shouldn t pay more than a third of your after tax salary on rent so if you make 2 000 usd a month after taxes are taken out look for an apartment building that offers rental rates less than 670 usd a month 5 x research source keep in mind though that more expensive apartment buildings often offset the cost by offering extra amenities determine which floor of a building will best suit your needs if a building has more than 1 floor ask the building manager which floors have open rooms that you could rent buildings on higher floors are often more expensive but they also tend to be quieter have better security and to have fewer pests on the other hand ground floor or garden level rooms are more convenient to get to and may come with outdoor space decide what s most important to you and choose an apartment building that offers rooms on the floor you prefer 6 x research source you can also use this criteria to remove buildings from the running say you like the idea of a no hassle move in and move out from a bottom floor but the building only has third floor rooms open move on and look into other buildings with the ground floor room you want find out what else is in the neighborhood with the apartment building take a 30 minute walk around the area and find out the distance to the nearest park whether a grocery store is within walking distance and how far you ll have to travel for a good cup of coffee or a hamburger or if you d rather save some time look around online to see what kinds of businesses public facilities and parks the neighborhood has for example it d be much nicer to live in a building in a cultural part of town than in one that borders an industrial power plant 7 x research source think about all the places you go most often and look for a building that s near as many of them as possible ask the property manager about the building s pet policy if you re moving with a pet make sure that the apartment building you re considering takes pets find out by talking to the property manager although most apartment buildings allow small cats and dogs under 20 pounds 9 1 kg some may disallow all kinds of pets on the other hand if you re severely allergic to cats or dogs an animal free building may be just what you re looking for 8 x research source you could also try looking online to find this information most apartment complexes will post their pet policy on their website it would also be wise to ask about a pet fee some buildings will charge a relatively small pet fee say 30 usd a month while others may charge prohibitively high fees say 300 usd a month see what the view is like from a few of the interior apartments while the view out of your apartment window may not make or break an apartment building it s still important in most cases apartments on higher floors that offer a view of a park mountains or other scenery will be more expensive than those that can only offer views of the back of a strip mall however the difference may be worth it if a terrible view discourages you from opening the blinds and letting in some sunshine if you re evaluating multiple apartment buildings within a single complex try to choose the building with the best view gauge how noisy an apartment will be based on its surroundings unless you re planning to hold frequent parties you re probably looking for a reasonably quiet apartment walk around both outside and inside the apartment building and see if there are any prospective sources of loud noises that could keep you from resting when you re home if 1 building in a large complex seems like it will be too loud ask the property manager if they can offer you a room in another on site building 9 x research source for example if the building houses the indoor pool gym or party room you may experience more noise than you can tolerate a building that s within a few dozen yards of a freeway railroad tracks or commercial buildings that take early deliveries also experience a lot of noise elevators can be noisy as can exit doors to stairways if your apartment is near the entrance you will have to listen to neighbors walking past your door at all hours ask if the building s outside door or gate is locked at night many sizeable apartment buildings or one in urban locations lock a gate at night to keep out non residents talk to the property manager and make sure that the gate is routinely locked nightly the slight inconvenience of having to stop and use your key to enter the building is often worth the peace of mind you get from knowing that you won t be easy prey for criminals door to door salespeople and people who would hang take out menus on your doorknob 10 x research source if all of the apartment doors open to the outside and there s not a fence around the property this step won t be relevant confirm that the building s interior is well kept and clean the way the building interior is kept reflects the quality of the apartment overall a clean well lit and well maintained interior will also help you feel safer and more at home if the interior hallways are dimly lit and covered in cobwebs the doors are unpainted and the carpet is filthy find a different building these are signs of negligent management and indicate that cleanliness isn t a priority to the maintenance crew 11 x research source also keep your eyes open for any signs of bug or rodent infestations leaky ceilings or broken windows it also wouldn t hurt to research the age of the building online an older building may result in higher premiums for your renter s insurance because it isn t up to the latest safety codes meet your prospective neighbors and find out what they re like the people who live around you in an apartment building can have a large impact on what living there is like for example an apartment may be appealingly cheap because the building is near the local college and full of partying noisy students or the building may be the last resort for troublesome tenants who ve been evicted from better places these are both good reasons to choose another building 12 x research source you can also ask the apartment manager or the building s owner what the tenants are like or spend an hour or 2 walking through the halls and make polite conversation with residents who emerge from their rooms it would also be wise to read online reviews of the apartment building to find out what previous residents have to say about the noise levels cleanliness and management,Home-and-Garden

how to survive a riot,though it may seem dramatic an angry mob can be just as dangerous and unpredictable as just about any natural disaster thousands of people are killed in riots all over the world each year and these riots erupt from a number of racial religious economic political or social causes that cannot be predetermined if you ve found yourself in the middle of a riot you may not be able to run away immediately but you can take some measures to protect yourself from harm if you want to know how to survive a riot just follow these steps,prepare an escape route if you know you re in a riot prone area but have no way to avoid being there then taking a few simple precautions can have a big impact on your life though it s easier to assume that a riot won t happen in your area it s better to be prepared for the worst even the calmest crowd can turn dangerous when its members are in a frantic angry mood anger and hysteria are contagious so it s best to know how to avoid these situations if they arise get familiar with your area if you re just visiting a location for a season or two you should still get to know your surroundings as intimately as possible study a map until you re very comfortable with the area where you work the area where you live and the routes between those think about your possible escape routes and safe havens before anything actually happens crossroads are good because you ve got at least one road to race off down if rioters go crazy or the police start charging if you work in a volatile environment make sure you know several routes for getting home so that you have a number of methods of escape in the event of a riot carry small amounts of cash with you in case you need to quickly arrange transportation pay off looters or address your basic needs remain calm riots bring intense emotions boiling to the surface but you ll be better off if you can keep your own emotions in check your adrenaline and survival instincts will kick in but strive to think rationally and pursue safety methodically avoid confrontation by keeping your head down walk at all times if you run or move too quickly you might attract unwanted attention keep your loved ones close if you re not alone then the first thing you should do is grip the hands or lock elbows with all of the people who are with you if you re with a child hold them in your arms so they don t get trampled sticking together with your loved ones should be your first priority and your second should be finding a way out reassure the people you re with that you have strength in numbers and that you ll be fine if you stick together don t get involved if you re caught in a riot the last thing you want to do is try to take sides help out or stand out in fact you should stand out as little as possible as you move to the outside of the mob and away from the action to do this stay close to the walls and other barriers and avoid bottlenecks or any areas where a lot of people are squeezing through a small space drive carefully if you re in a car unless your car is the focus of the angry mob in the riot you should stay in the car and continue driving as calmly as possible try to keep to the streets that are clear of riots and avoid the main roads that are more likely to be occupied keep moving forward and don t stop to assess the situation if someone tries to block your car honk your car and keep driving until they get out of the way of course this doesn t mean you should hit the person drive at moderate speed so they have time to back off and realize that you mean business remember that you re in a position of power when you re driving don t let a few angry people stop you from driving your car and keep going unless you absolutely can t many activists are afraid of cars because there have been cases of drivers running down the protesters on the roads remember to be firm but not aggressive to avoid giving the wrong impression move away from the riot as calmly as possible if you re on foot you should move away by going with the flow of foot traffic not against it if you go against the traffic you re much more likely to stand out to get stampeded or just to get pushed or blocked if you feel that you may fall down in the big crowd and get trampled use your elbows to push down on the crowd so that it carries you though you may want to run for your life you should move calmly and relatively slowly continue to move with the crowd until you can escape into a doorway an alley a side street or a safe building if you re in the middle of a crowd it s especially important to try to move in the direction of the crowd until you make your way to the outside of the crowd avoid heavy traffic areas to maximize your chances of safety you should avoid the areas that are most likely to be crowded and should stay off the beaten path so you don t put yourself in a dangerous situation even if the heavy traffic areas are your quickest path home they won t be the safest path if they are the targets of any rioters here s what you should do avoid major roads major roads squares and other high traffic areas are likely to be crowded with rioters if possible stick to less traveled side streets to avoid the mobs avoid public transportation buses subways and trains will likely be out of service and stations and depots will probably be packed with people move to a safe enclosed area riots most commonly happen outside on the streets not inside buildings just by moving inside a sturdy and controlled building you can protect yourself from the brunt of a

in advance if you re really concerned about finding a safe space in the event of a riot if you can talk to the owners first lock the doors and windows and stay away from them though you may be tempted to watch the riot from the windows this will increase your chances of getting hurt move to rooms that do not lead directly outside to avoid getting hit by stones bullets or other projectiles look for at least 2 exits in the building in case you need to leave in a rush just look out for fire if an angry mob turns toward the building it can be a target stay informed use the local news radio and social media to alert you as to where to stay away from just as the rioters have started using social media and texting to alert one another where to go you can flip this on its head and ask people to help you know where to stay away from messages informing you of which streets and areas are currently being targeted provide you with instantaneous warnings of where to avoid social media may provide

military gesture furthermore if you do not want to be mistaken for a rioter by the police avoid dark colored clothing especially black hooded sweaters since this type of clothing is associated with rioters in many countries around the world every crowd of rioters is unique though you can t do a costume change in the middle of a riot you should try to avoid looking like the rioters if you can for example if you re caught in a riot and are wearing the same sweatshirt as the rioters take it off carry a solution for rinsing your eyes in case you re exposed to tear gas if you re worried that you may be exposed to tear gas you should have a solution of half liquid antacid and half water you can find these products at many drug stores and grocery store and a spray solution is generally best if necessary use it to rinse your eyes if you are exposed to tear gas you can also carry toothpaste with you and smear it under your eyes if tear gas is released and you have nothing else available to protect you do your best to avoid being hit by riot control chemicals or weapons police may deploy riot control agents tear gas water cannons or rubber bullets for example to disperse a crowd these weapons and chemicals can cause severe pain respiratory distress and blindness try to stay away from the front lines of a riot and learn to recognize the signs that a riot control agent has been used

how to survive an abduction or hostage situation,it s really scary to think about being abducted or taken hostage but knowing how you should handle the situation can help you feel calm and focused if it does happen while the best thing you can do is to avoid an attack in the first place if someone attempts to kidnap you try to get away before they can incapacitate you if you are taken into captivity comply with your kidnappers and observe your surroundings until you can escape or be rescued,run away from someone who tries to take you if you can if you re ever in a situation where someone tries to abduct you do anything you can to avoid going with them try to pull away from them then run as fast as you can in the direction of the nearest people or building that you can see 1 x research source especially avoid getting into a vehicle since it will be much harder for authorities to find you if your attacker drives you a long distance if you re taken hostage the situation may unfold very quickly and you might not have the opportunity to run yell to draw attention to the situation if someone makes an attempt to kidnap you start shouting right away especially if you know there are people nearby even if the attackers manage to subdue you keep yelling to try to get someone s attention if someone hears a shout and they see what s happening they may be able to help you before you re taken 2 x research source try yelling something like help or call the police as a suggestion yelling fire is your best bet people are more likely to respond to fire and this can summon help faster at the very least an onlooker can contact the authorities and let them know that an abduction has taken place they may also to provide critical details like the kidnapper s physical appearance or the type of vehicle they re driving really try to get the license plate to see if the car was stolen or to see if it is really their car fight your attacker as hard as you can it can be really hard not to panic but if you can stay calm and focused on survival you may be able to fight off an attack if someone grabs you fight in any way you re able whether that s hitting kicking biting or scratching as you do that try to target your kidnapper s eyes nose throat or groin as these are especially sensitive targets as long as there s still a chance you could break free and run it s worth fighting for 3 x research source this is your best chance to escape because the moment will be hectic and there s a chance someone will see what s happening and intervene look for objects in your environment to use as weapons as you re fighting off your attacker try to gather yourself enough to scan around you look for anything that s close enough to grab that might give you an edge in the fight if there s nothing that you can use as an offensive weapon check for anything you can use as a barrier between you and your attacker like a chair or a table 4 x research source for instance even if your attacker knocks you down you might spot a loose chunk of sidewalk that you can grab to hit them with in your home you might be able to grab a heavy vase or lamp a fireplace poker or even a large book follow your captors instructions once you are in captivity if at any point it becomes clear that your captors have gained the upper hand stop resisting right away and comply with any orders they give you you re more likely to be hurt or killed if you continue fighting after you re overpowered such as if you re being held by multiple people put in restraints or placed in a vehicle or other confined space 5 x research source once you re abducted or taken hostage it s best to take a measured approach to escaping rather than an impulsive one so start evaluating your surroundings rather than fighting to get away if you re put into a vehicle while you re conscious try to pay attention to as much about the trip as you can like how long the car travels without stopping the direction of any turns or any sounds you notice on the road if you re in the trunk of a car look for a glow in the dark handle that you can pull to release yourself from the trunk if this release cord isn t present try to kick out the tail lights and wave your hands to alert other motorists that you re trapped inside 6 x research source stay calm and focused on survival it might be really hard but once you re taken captive try to dig deep within yourself to find your composure try to hold onto your dignity rather than crying hysterically or begging for them to let you go that will make you seem more human in your kidnappers eyes which may make them less likely to kill you 7 x research source if you can help it try not to even cry 8 x research source when you re talking to the person who s abducted you or taken you hostage speak softly and clearly don t be belligerent or uncooperative if you antagonize your captors they may be more likely to attack or even kill you 9 x research source try to connect with your kidnappers but don t pretend to support them it can help to talk to your kidnappers about universal subjects like families your hobbies or sports however don t go so far as to try to befriend your captors or defend their cause they re likely to see this as a ruse which could anger them 10 x research source if there s anything you want or need like medication or a book calmly ask for it it might help establish some rapport during conversations with your captors avoid the subject of politics or religion especially if you are being held by terrorists 11 x research source if you have pictures of your family with them you can even show them to your captors to help them see you as more of a person rather than just a victim observe as much of your environment as you can while you re in captivity pay attention to every detail this might include how many people are holding you their physical descriptions and any exits in the place you re being held you might spot something that helps you escape or you might be able to provide authorities with key information that will lead them to your captors after you re rescued 12 x research source even if you re blindfolded or it s dark you might be able to pick up on sounds or smells that can give you clues to your location for instance if you hear a lot of traffic you ll know that you might be able to find help if you can just escape the building other details to notice about your captors might include their accents their names or aliases and who seems to be in charge if they seem to follow the same routine each day make note of that as well do not admit to accusations if you re interrogated in some cases you might be taken hostage or abducted because your captors believe that you have information they could use for political or personal gain no matter what they do do not divulge any information that can be used against you 13 x research source however do try to act like you re being cooperative for instance you might answer questions about your line of work without divulging your company s bank account numbers find a way to communicate if there are other captives if you re taken hostage as part of a group or if you discover that your captives have also abducted others try to set up some way to communicate however avoid speaking openly amongst yourselves in front of your captors as they may separate restrain or even kill some members of the group in an attempt to subdue everyone 14 x research source you might speak quietly amongst yourselves when they kidnappers are out of the room for instance or you might tap out a message if you know morse code it may be helpful to set up a code word in case the opportunity to escape arises prepare yourself to be held for a long time depending on the situation you may be held for only a few hours but you might be there for days months or even years as you begin to adjust to your situation try to develop a daily schedule tracking time by outside cues like birds chirping temperature changes in the room or even your guards activities 15 x research source even if it doesn t seem very appetizing each whatever food they give you so you ll stay healthy and strong try to use flexing exercises like planks and squats to keep your muscles strong many of these can be adapted to work even if you have a very small range of movement meditation or prayer can be a good way to keep yourself mentally strong while you re being held fortunately the longer your captors hold you the more your chances of survival increase 16 x research source wait to be rescued unless you are sure you can escape safely if you re in captivity you re most likely to be killed if your captors discover you trying to escape if you see an opportunity to escape and you re absolutely sure it can work take it however if that s not the case bide your time 17 x research source tracking an abduction victim or negotiating with hostage takers can take a lot of work so it s important to be patient and allow the authorities to find you similarly if you gain access to a phone only try to dial emergency services if you re sure you can do it unnoticed an exception to waiting for rescue is if you believe your captors are planning to kill you for instance if they suddenly stop feeding you or if they seem very nervous or scared your life may be in danger and you should find any way out you can 18 x research source if you do escape get somewhere safe right away like a police station or a crowded building follow the authorities directions if you re rescued if you re found by the authorities there will likely be several chaotic moments where they have to determine who s a kidnapper and who s a victim for your safety get low to the ground with your hands behind your head or crossed in front of your chest don t run and don t make any sudden movements 19 x research source as the authorities secure the scene they may handcuff and search you allow them to do this then let them know that you ve been abducted see a doctor for medical attention as soon as possible once you escape or you re rescued you need to be evaluated by a doctor for any physical trauma you might have occurred as a result of the abduction however it s equally as important to talk to a mental health professional to help you process your experience as well 20 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source find a therapist who specializes in trauma to ensure you get the care you need remind yourself that kidnapping is uncommon when you start to feel anxious it s extremely unlikely that you ll face a kidnapping attempt in your lifetime keeping this in mind may help you regain a feeling of control if your anxiety starts to spiral out of control however don t beat yourself up over your anxiety it s normal to worry that bad things may happen to you or your family especially if you ve recently read or heard about a kidnapping case 21 x research source this may be particularly true if the kidnapping was in your area or happened to someone who resembles you take steps to be prepared in case a kidnapping attempt does occur everyone can benefit from some basic safety awareness like paying attention to your surroundings or being cautious around strangers however if you perceive yourself to be at a greater threat for being a kidnapping target take extra precautions to protect yourself this can give you the piece of mind you need so you re not preoccupied with anxiety 22 x research source for instance if you are visiting a different country you work for a political or social organization or your family is very wealthy you may feel that you re more likely to be targeted if you re in an area that s politically unstable pay attention to daily news reports as well as any terrorist threat levels and assess your own kidnapping risk based on that stay aware of your surroundings while you don t need to constantly obsess about kidnapping it can help you have better peace of mind if you keep your guard up especially when you re out in public or if you re around people you don t know well pay attention to what people around you are doing and trust your instincts if something or someone seems suspicious try to leave the situation as soon as possible 23 x research source whether you re traveling or you re in your home town try to avoid locations that have a reputation for being unsafe also avoid walking alone at night park in well lit areas and ask someone to walk you to your car if you re by yourself when you arrive at your home have your keys in your hand before you exit your vehicle if you have a garage open the garage door drive in and make sure the garage door is fully closed before you get out of the vehicle don t reveal personal information about yourself when you re talking on the phone in a public location as this could give a kidnapper information they could use against you try to make yourself as inconspicuous as possible when you re out in public avoid drawing attention to yourself as this can make you a more attractive target to potential kidnappers wear nondescript clothing and avoid wearing jewelry or flashy shoes also depending on where you re going you may not want to carry high value electronics like a smartphone tablet or nice camera 24 x research source if you re traveling by foot walk confidently and with purpose avoid stopping on the street to check a map and take care whom you ask for directions since you want to avoid giving the appearance of being a lost tourist change up your routine every few days kidnappers often study a person s daily habits before attempting to take them you can make yourself a more difficult target by making your movements unpredictable for instance you might plan out several paths to work or school and change which one you take every 2 3 days 25 x research source you can also eat lunch at a different restaurant each day visit different bars or meet your friends at different times or leave for work at a different time if you do believe you re being followed in your vehicle immediately drive to a police station or somewhere you feel safe if you re walking go into the nearest crowded public space 26 x research source if you re working for a government agency overseas consider driving a nondescript vehicle without any obvious markings so you re less likely to be identified on the road take self defense classes to feel more confident

how to survive a school or workplace shooting,although unlikely a shooting can happen at any school or workplace it pays to be prepared and know in advance what creates the best chance for survival running should always be your first priority but be ready to hide or fight for your life if there is no safe escape route,run away whenever possible your best chance to survive the shooting is to get out of the area as fast as possible 1 x research source only rule this out if the only escape routes would put you in sight of the shooter know the escape routes prepare in advance by identifying all exits from the rooms where you spend the most time this includes emergency exits fire escapes and windows ideally plan at least two escape routes out of the school or workplace in case the shooter is blocking one of them 2 x research source don t rule out second story windows or windows that you would have to break you can survive cuts from broken glass or a broken leg from a fall 98 of shooters act alone if you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire you are usually safe do not pull the fire alarm even as an attempt to evacuate others the evacuation procedures for a fire and an active shooter are completely different and pulling the fire alarm can increase the risk of casualties as a result 3 x research source react immediately don t freeze up or waste time debating your options find an escape route and start running if you hear gunshots in the distance you can likely get out of the area before the shooter arrives if you have shoes that prevent you from running take them off forget your belongings if you ve determined that it s best to run then forget your wallet your purse or your cell phone though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you none of them are as important as your life run directly to the exit do not slow yourself down with evasive maneuvers such as running in a zig zag or bending over as you run run as fast as you can directly to safety these tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you and using a weapon with a low rate of fire getting away fast is usually the better option the one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit in this case running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance see the section on hiding for advice on finding cover that will stop a bullet bring people with you as you re running encourage others to run if someone looks disoriented or too scared to move grab that person and drag him with you tell the people that running is crucial to their survival if you re running in a bigger group it ll be harder to target you individually and you ll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter grab a weapon only if convenient if you happen to see a sharp object or a blunt object you can carry while running grab it do not waste time looking for one of these when you could be running this is only for a last case scenario when you are unable to escape the shooters if you have to fight close distance is your friend get as close as you can without being noticed grab the barrel with 1 hand and cover the ejection port with the other try to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction the shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire but only once because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round that weapon is now a useless hunk of metal until the shooter can clear and cycle another round in manually perfect opportunity for you to take the weapon away and subdue the shooter choose this course of action if running is impossible it should only take a few seconds to determine if running is a possibility if the shooter is rapidly approaching your room or if he is blocking the only escape route start hiding or barricading yourself in immediately hiding is the second option because it traps you in one area however most mass shooting events are over within ten or fifteen minutes if you can avoid the shooter for that long you have a good chance at surviving 4 x research source split tasks with other people in the room if there are other people in the room get their attention and assign them to the following tasks each described in more detail below one person should call 9 1 1 or the emergency number in your region one group of people should lock and barricade the door one group of people should grab anything that could be used as a weapon turn off the lights immediately turn off the lights in the room where you are this will make the shooter less likely to enter the room and slightly increase your chance of survival if he does lock and barricade the door lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up and they re not interested in taking the path of most resistance lock the door place a doorstop on it and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter if the shooter is approaching get away from the door as soon as you can stay away from all doors and windows if the door opens to the outside a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment building one may not be worth wasting time and blocking a potential escape route if you re in a bathroom that doesn t lock loop a belt or t shirt around the arms of the door butler the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open call emergency services a mass shooting typically continues for five minutes before anyone calls the police if you have other people in the room to barricade the door calling immediately can be a big help once they ve been called law enforcement typically arrives within three minutes 5 x research source use a landline instead of your cell phone if possible so the police can automatically trace the call if you can t reach an emergency service look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by holding a lighter underneath the detector this should automatically call the fire department grab any weapons you can find look around the room where you re hiding and find anything that you can use as a weapon it can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find on the teacher s desk the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office beakers or dangerous acids such as sulfuric acid in a science room or anything that is sharp heavy made of glass or which can be used as a weapon hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room where you are even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people work together while this is obviously a last resort anyone who can t find a weapon should grab something to throw 6 x research source find cover the term cover refers to barriers that will stop a bullet brick or concrete walls steel building support beams or thick trees are the most common examples if you are trapped in a single room your best option is a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet ideally find a spot that does not restrict your movement if the situation changes you want to be able to run to an exit as fast as possible find concealment if cover is not available concealment hides you from the shooter s line of sight but will not protect you from gunfire if it s your only option hide behind furniture in closets or in any other hiding spot crouch low to the ground to minimize the chance that a stray bullet hits you most interior walls will not stop a bullet turn off anything that makes noise if you have time silence your cell phone and other electronics so the sound won t encourage the shooter to approach you try to stay calm though this may seem nearly impossible it s crucial that you remain absolutely silent tell people that whimpering or crying will only make the shooter more likely to find you be mentally prepared for the event that the shooter comes into the room and finds you in that case you ll have no choice but to fight as described below play dead as a last resort people have survived mass shootings by playing dead in areas where shots have been fired 7 x research source however some shooters are aware of this tactic and will target bodies the only time you should try this is when both running and hiding are impossible remember that attacking the shooter is your final option you shouldn t jump out of your hiding place and attack the shooter if he s approaching you should only fight him if you re sure that you ll be shot if you do nothing do not try to reason with the shooter or plead for your life trying to engage with the shooter ask him what he s doing or to plead for your life by talking about your family has not been proven effective in dealing with shooters don t waste your time by trying to talk to him you re much better off fighting work with others to create confusion if you are in a group of people and cannot avoid the shooter your best chance is to create as much noise and movement as possible shouting throwing objects and running will buy you a few extra seconds to leave the room or to attack the shooter if there is no escape route attack the shooter with any weapon you can use scissors glass or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter as soon as you are in close proximity even a sharp ballpoint pen is better than nothing you re fighting for your life and every second counts once again this is an absolute last resort most shooters are heavily armed and some wear body armor even if you have a gun of your own you are most likely at a disadvantage aim high try to hurt the shooter in the face eyes shoulders or neck or arms so that they are more likely to let go of their weapon you should stab them in the neck gouge out their eyes or stab them in the arm doing anything you can to make them get rid of the weapon or to hurt them so the weapon is within your reach kick him in the crotch this is more effective if they are a man although it could still hurt distract and discourage a female shooter if you can t go for their face or weapon this will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain commit to the attack once you are in this situation hesitation or panic can be fatal be as aggressive as possible attacking with anything you can do not try to run or stop fighting even if you are shot in the leg or arm report any suspicious activity keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities if a student or co worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school report this to a teacher or law enforcement you may prevent a disaster by doing so many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately 8 x research source be aware of your school or workplace s lockdown procedure every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked where people should hide and how the authorities should be called so if you d like to be prepared for a shooting be familiar with your workplace s standard procedure when it comes to shootings unfortunately it may be difficult to follow the protocol exactly in the event of a shooting but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible be prepared for a shooting though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting if you d really like to be prepared you should take self defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident if you have no choice but to attack a shooter do not run to law enforcement the first people to arrive are there to locate and deal with the shooter not to rescue people do not leave a hiding spot and do not get in their way if you are wounded wait for a paramedic or firefighter keep your hands up when you are within sight of the police raise your hands and spread your fingers to show you are not a threat keep your hands visible at all times tell the police what you know if you have any information on the shooter s location or type of weaponry let the nearest officer know move in the direction the police came from don t stop to ask police for directions if it s safe to move run in the direction the police came from keeping your hands raised and visible obey police instructions immediately do so as fast as possible and without argument,Home-and-Garden
how to escape a minefield,fields peppered with deadly mines in north korea afghanistan india vietnam iraq and many other places are responsible for thousands of deaths every year even mines decades old are as dangerous as when they were first laid capable of exploding at the slightest pressure read on to find out how to safely escape a minefield and avoid entering one in the first place,look for signs that mines are close most mines are hidden but if you know what to look for you ll have a better chance of avoiding them don t let your guard down even for a moment if you are in a mined area constantly be on the lookout for the following signs trip wires these aren t usually clearly visible so you ve got to look closely at the ground wires are usually thin enough to be almost impossible to see signs of road repair this includes paved areas new fill road patches ditches and so on this could be a sign that mines were installed nearby signs or markers on trees stakes or posts the forces that place the mines may mark the minefields to protect their own soldiers 1 x trustworthy source united nations official site for the united nations an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations go to source dead animals 2 x research source cattle and other animals frequently detonate mines damaged vehicles abandoned cars trucks or other vehicles may have detonated a mine and more could be close by suspicious objects in trees and bushes not all mines are buried and not all uxo land on the ground disturbances in previous tire tracks or tracks that stop inexplicably wires leading away from the side of the road they may be firing wires that are partially buried odd features in the ground or patterns that are not present in nature 3 x research source plant growth may wilt or change color rain may wash away some of the cover the cover may sink or crack around the edges or the material covering the mines may look like mounds of dirt civilians staying away from certain places or out of certain buildings 4 x research source locals often know where mines or unexploded ordnance uxo are located question civilians to determine the exact locations stop immediately 5 x research source the moment you realize you may be in danger freeze do not take another step take some time to assess your situation and formulate an escape plan your movements from now on need to be slow careful and considered call out a warning to companions as soon as you think you are in danger make sure everyone knows so they can stop moving before someone detonates an explosive yell freeze and tell them to not to move their feet if you re the leader in this situation you ll have to coach them on how to leave the field safely make sure everyone s on the same page because one wrong move could get everyone killed do not pick anything up many mines are booby trapped 6 x research source you think you re picking up a helmet radio or military artifact and lo and behold there s a mine inside even toys and food are used as bait if you didn t drop it don t pick it up backtrack your way out of a mined area should you suspect that you have entered a minefield or mined area either because you see warning signs you see a mine or potential mine or because a detonation occurs remain calm and carefully back out of danger by stepping in your footsteps if possible do not turn around look behind you as you walk and slowly place your feet exactly where they were before continue until you are sure you are out of danger such as when you reach a road or other frequently traveled area probe the ground if you have to move forward for some reason or you can t see your tracks to backtrack you ll need to probe the ground for mines and move forward little by little probe the ground very carefully with your hands or feet you can also use a knife or another object to gently probe the area inch by inch probe at an angle rather than straight down since mines are usually detonated from top down pressure 7 x research source once you ve cleared a small area move forward and continue probing it s safest to move through the field very slowly and on your belly rather than walking through get help if you re in over your head if you re not absolutely sure where you stepped before and you don t feel comfortable probing don t risk moving inches can be the difference between life and death call for help or have people nearby do so 8 x research source if you are alone and can use a cell phone call for help do not use two way radios unless absolutely necessary the signal from the radio may cause certain types of mines or uxo to accidentally detonate 9 x research source if you have no way of reaching anyone wait do not try to make a run for it and do not attempt to probe your way out unless you know what you are doing pay attention for signs that a detonation may occur when exiting a minefield be alert for signs that a mine may detonate listen for unusual noises you may notice a faint click if a pressure plate has been depressed or a tilt rod has been moved or more likely you may hear the pop of the exploding cap pay attention to what you can feel as well if you are very alert and proceed slowly you may be able to feel the tension of a trip wire for example drop to the ground immediately if a detonation has been initiated 10 x research source soldiers call this hitting the deck if you notice any of the signs from the last step or if someone nearby cries out a warning that they have detonated a mine drop to the ground as quickly as possible you may have as little as a second before the mine explodes but if you use that second wisely you may be able to escape serious injury or death mines explode upward and it s safest close to the ground if possible fall backward in order to shield your upper body from shrapnel as much as possible while it s certainly possible to fall onto another mine the area right behind you is the safest place to fall because you were just walking there do not try to outrun the explosion projectiles will fly out from the mine at thousands of feet per second and the casualty radius the distance from the mine in which you can expect to be injured can be up to 100 feet or more mark the hazard and report its location to the proper authorities if you find a mine help make sure that other people avoid it by marking it 11 x research source use internationally recognized symbols or signs if possible or use the customary local warning make sure you are in safe territory before attempting to erect a warning note the location of the danger and report it to police the military or local de miners learn about land mines unexploded ordnance uxo is a term used to denote any kind of explosive weapons such as bombs grenades and artillery shells that have been used but have not yet exploded duds in other words and that retain the potential to detonate 12 x research source landmines are sometimes considered a type of uxo and while mines receive the most media attention all uxos are dangerous in some parts of the world uxo other than mines present the greatest hazard learn about the history of an area anytime that you are traveling to an unfamiliar area it s wise to learn about the history of that area to determine if there is a landmine risk areas that are experiencing armed conflict are clearly high risk but landmines and uxos remain dangerous long after the cessation of hostilities in vietnam cambodia and laos for example millions of mines and dud bombs remain and even in belgium long combat free crews have removed hundreds of tons of uxo left over from wwi and wwii in the past few years heed warning signs while you can t always count on minefields being marked you should definitely stay away from those that are internationally recognized symbols for minefields include a skull and crossbones and a red triangle signs are often but not always red and they frequently say mines or danger 13 x research source where signs are not present improvised warnings are often used such as painted rocks red usually indicates the boundary of the minefield and white indicates a safe path through it piles of stones flags in the ground tied grass or ribbons cordoning off an area many minefields have no warning signs so don t take the lack of a warning sign as an indication that the area is safe 14 x research source inquire locally mine warnings often don t last long over time plants weather animals and people dismantle or conceal signs in some areas metal signs are a valuable building material and it s not uncommon to see a mine warning used for example to patch a metal roof what s more in many places warnings are never installed local people however often know the general locations of mines and uxo so your best bet when traveling in potentially dangerous territory is to ask the locals whether an area is safe or better yet get a guide don t stray off established paths except in active combat situations if people regularly use a path you can be sure it is not mined just off the path however danger may be lurking,Home-and-Garden
how to be safe during a landslide,landslides occur when large amounts of wet debris including rocks earth and trees slide down a slope they may occur as a result of fires earthquakes volcanic eruptions storms or human activity landslides are particularly dangerous because they strike suddenly move at extremely high speeds and travel long distances 1 x research source although landslides are often difficult to predict you can prepare for a landslide by following proper safety protocol familiarizing yourself with the warning signs and making an emergency plan,keep yourself alert and awake landslides can occur quite suddenly so you need to be ready to take action at a moment s notice many landslide related deaths occur while people are asleep 2 x research source if you are with other people work together to keep one another awake watch and listen for warning signs of a nearby landslide including sounds of falling debris or changes in water clarity or flow it is imperative that you familiarize yourself with landslide warning signs especially if you live in an at risk area keep reading to learn more about landslide warning signs in detail listen to a local news station for updates using a battery powered radio or television listen to your local news station for updates about the weather be alert to warnings about intense rainfall which can trigger landslides 3 x research source evacuate if it is safe to do so sometimes your local law enforcement will order an evacuation but other times they may not be aware of a landslide until it is too late if you think a landslide is imminent and it is safe to leave evacuate immediately contact your neighbors and your local police or fire department to warn them of danger 4 x research source be sure to bring your animals with you don t forget to bring your emergency kit which contains essential items like food water and medication you ll learn how to make one in a later section be cautious and alert while driving if you need to drive to leave a dangerous area proceed with caution beware of flooded roads collapsed pavement fallen debris and washed out bridges do not cross flooded streams instead turn around and try to find an alternative route 5 x research source move to a second story if possible if it isn t safe to leave the building but you believe a landslide is imminent move to the building s second story if possible 6 x research source move out of the path of the landslide as quickly as you can landslides move very quickly much faster than you can run or walk trying to outrun a landslide is futile instead remove yourself as fast as you can from the path of the landslide 7 x research source before crossing any bridges always look upstream to see if a landslide is approaching if this is the case do not cross the bridge and move out of the path of the landslide avoid river valleys and other low areas these areas are especially dangerous when landslides are imminent so stay away 8 x research source curl into a ball if you cannot escape in some cases you may not be able to escape if you are trapped in the path of a landslide curl up into a tight ball and protect your head 9 x research source go to a public shelter your local community should have a designated public shelter go to the shelter if your home is unsafe or the authorities have called for an evacuation 10 x research source to find the shelter closest to you text shelter your zip code to 43362 4fema for example if your zip code is 56789 you would text shelter 56789 avoid the area where the landslide occurred landslides may recur in the same location avoid this area and seek shelter 11 x research source check for trapped and injured people you should not enter the area where the landslide occurred however if you can see people who are trapped or injured in the area notify the authorities immediately 12 x research source help neighbors who need special assistance infants the disabled and the elderly may experience extra difficulty in emergency situations if it is safe to do so help your neighbors with special needs remember that neighbors with large families may require additional assistance as well 13 x research source assess the area for damage and safety report any damaged utility lines roadways and railways to the authorities if you are in a building examine its foundation chimney and surrounding land to determine if the structure is stable if the area appears unsafe leave immediately 14 x research source replant the affected area landslides often destroy vegetation without vegetation the area is more susceptible to erosion and flash flooding which can lead to another landslide replanting the affected area helps prevent future landslides 15 x research source talk to a geotechnical expert if your property was damaged in the landslide consider talking to a geotechnical expert to reduce landslide risk the expert can evaluate your property and determine what modifications if any should be made to ensure your safety 16 x research source look for new areas of moisture if you see springs or puddles in areas of the ground that are usually dry this could be a sign of an imminent landslide 17 x research source look for warping in your home take note if your deck patio or concrete floors are tilting pulling away from the building or cracking sticking doors and windows could also indicate warping that precedes a landslide 18 x research source broken water lines or other utilities may also be a warning sign look for warping and movement in the surrounding area sunken roadbeds and leaning fences telephone poles and trees can signal an imminent landslide 19 x research source notice unusual sounds a faint rumbling sound that gets louder and louder could indicate an approaching landslide sounds like cracking trees or scraping rocks may signal moving debris from a landslide 20 x research source monitor changing water levels a sudden increase in creek water levels is a warning sign as is a sudden decrease in water levels despite recent rain 21 x research source if you live near a waterway check the water s clarity a change from clear to muddy could mean a landslide is imminent follow proper land use procedures proper land use procedures dictate that you should not build near mountain edges steep slopes or natural erosion valleys these areas are prone to landslides 22 x research source contact local officials about past landslides landslides tend to happen in the same area where they have occurred before talk to local officials about landslides in your area if you are in an at risk area consider getting a site analysis of your property this will help you determine any necessary corrective measures 23 x research source you should be especially attuned to landslide warning signs if you live in an at risk area consider building retaining or deflection walls retaining walls channels and deflection walls can shield your property from landslide debris and divert debris flow if you live in an area that is vulnerable to landslides consult a professional to see what should be done 24 x research source beware if your channels or deflection walls cause debris to flow into a neighbor s property you may have to pay for damages talk to an insurance agent if your area is at risk if your area is vulnerable to landslides talk to an insurance agent to see if your insurance covers landslide related damage although landslide insurance is not usually available some flood insurance policies cover damage from landslide flows 25 x research source make an emergency kit an emergency kit contains the essentials that your household will need during an emergency make your kit in advance so it is ready at a moment s notice your kit should contain enough food and water to last for at least 72 hours as well as supplies like medications flashlights batteries cell phones copies of personal documents and cash 26 x research source remember that landslides can cut off services like electricity sewage treatment gas water and telephones pack supplies in your kit that will allow you to deal with these outages choose food that is non perishable and can be prepared during power outages pack any important items that would be difficult or impossible to replace discuss safety protocol in the event of a landslide talk to your family about the appropriate actions to take in order to stay safe during a landslide especially if you live in a vulnerable area be sure to discuss evacuation procedures as well as safe locations and areas to avoid 27 x research source understand how to get emergency alerts make sure everyone knows how to get emergency alerts from local officials whether it be via phone television or radio talk to your local emergency management agency to see how alerts are delivered in your area 28 x research source don t forget to emphasize the importance of listening to the local news station for emergency updates in the event of a landslide collect family members contact information write down each family member s phone number email social media medical facilities and school or workplace having this information on hand will make it easier for family members to get in touch in the event of the landslide or other emergencies pick an emergency meeting place in the event of a landslide or other emergency choose a place where the family will meet to reunite select a location in your neighborhood and your town make sure everyone is aware of the location 29 x research source choose a location that is accessible for everyone in your family particularly for members with disabilities if you have pets pick a pet friendly area you might choose to meet at a neighbor s house or your mailbox for

how to survive a volcanic eruption,volcanic activity can result in explosions called plinian eruptions that shoot rocks ash and gas hundreds of feet into the air while not all types of volcanic eruptions are so dramatic they can all be terrifying fortunately most volcanoes are carefully monitored and scientists can usually provide some advance warning before a serious event but if you live near a volcano or get an opportunity to visit one you are always at risk and it s important to know how to prepare for an eruption and escape one alive,know your community s warning system if you live near a volcano your community likely has a plan in place to warn people that the volcano may erupt in many cases sirens and emergency alerts on televisions are used to alert people that danger is imminent local radio stations will also broadcast important advisories since each region is a little different it s important to know the specific warning procedures in your area 1 x research source as soon as you hear a siren turn on the radio to find out what the local emergency management agency advises you may be told to stay indoors keep away from certain areas or in extreme cases evacuate if you don t live in the area and you re just traveling through you should still be familiar with the region s warning system so you ll know what it means when you hear it get familiar with the evacuation procedures if you live near a well researched and well monitored volcano you can probably obtain a hazard zone map from your local emergency management agency or in the u s from the u s geological survey these maps show the probable paths of lava flows and lahar or mudflows and give estimates for the minimum time it would take a flow to reach a given location they also divide the area around the volcano into zones from high risk to low risk using this information you can get some idea of how safe your house or workplace is and you can plan the best route of escape because volcanic eruptions are complex and to some extent unpredictable you should have several alternative routes to reach one or more safe zones develop a household evacuation plan figure out what you ll need to do if you hear the sirens go off map out exactly where your family will go and figure out the safest way to get there keep in mind that if the sky is filled with ash you won t be able to travel far by car since ash interferes with mechanisms in car engines and prevents them from operating correctly talk with each of your family members about the evacuation plan make sure everyone knows exactly what to do and where to meet don t forget to include your pets in your evacuation plan it s a good idea to have a checklist you can run down so you make sure you don t forget anyone or anything in the heat of the moment include a list of the people and animals that should be present the possessions you ll take with you and fast actions you might take to seal up your house to prevent as much damage as possible stock up on necessities store at least a two weeks supply of food and portable water at your home in the event of an eruption water supplies may become contaminated so you can t count on your well or public water keep all your supplies in one place a large container that you can carry for example so that you can quickly bring them with you if you need to evacuate in addition to food and water stock up on the following a first aid kit blankets and warm clothing a battery powered radio and fresh batteries so that you will be able to listen to advisories if the power goes out necessary medications a map of the region be prepared when you re traveling near a volcano if you will be visiting a volcano knowledge is your most important protection before going to the volcano consult with local authorities and heed their recommendations or warnings learn about the hazards you may encounter in the area of the volcano and get a reputable guide to accompany you if possible if you re going to be climbing or hiking near the volcano you should bring a few survival items that will help you survive if you re caught outside without access to shelter you ll need a respirator and goggles to protect your face and help you breathe bring long pants and long sleeved shirts bring plenty of water in case you become unexpectedly trapped by a lava flow and don t overexert yourself you ll be able to react more quickly and run for your life if necessary if you re not fatigued listen for radio or tv advisories if you hear the sirens go off when a volcano erupts immediately tune in to determine if you are in immediate danger where you are and also to find out what is happening around you these advisories will be your eyes to see the larger picture and help you assess the situation and make the right decisions the sirens will most likely be your first warning that an eruption is occurring but you might receive other indications that something is amiss if you see a plume of debris rising from the volcano or if you feel an earthquake tune in immediately make sure your battery operated radio is in working order in case the power goes out it s an important way to stay connected and learn about updates that can affect your safety do not ignore emergency instructions in most cases you ll be told to stay inside but you may be ordered to evacuate it s extremely important to follow the advisories whatever they may be in order to ensure your family s safety most importantly if you re told to evacuate do it right away conversely if you are not instructed to evacuate the area stay where you are unless you can see immediate danger taking to the roads may be more hazardous than staying at home in recent eruptions many people have been killed because they did not heed an evacuation order if you are lucky enough to get advance warning use it wisely instead of trying to hold your ground it s also important to evacuate the area as soon as possible after being told to do so if you wait too long you ll have to deal with ash fall which will muck up your car s engine and make it more difficult to leave get inside if you re caught outdoors unless you need to evacuate the safest place you can be is inside a strong structure close all the windows and doors to protect yourself from ash and burning cinders 2 x research source make sure all of your family members are inside and that your emergency supply of food and water is indoors with you if you own livestock bring them inside their shelter and close the doors and windows if you have time protect machinery by putting it inside a garage get to high ground if you can t find shelter lava flows lahars mudflows and flooding are common in a major eruption all of these can be deadly and all of them tend to travel in valleys and low lying areas climb to higher ground and stay there until you can confirm that the danger has passed protect yourself from pyroclastics while you want to get to higher ground you should also try to shield yourself from pyroclastics which are rocks and debris sometimes red hot that are sent flying during an eruption the most important thing to do is watch out for them and get out of their range sometimes they actually rain down and in some types of eruptions such as that which occurred at mount st helens in 1980 they can land miles from the volcano s crater protect yourself by staying below the ridgelines of hills and on the side of the hill opposite the volcano if you are caught in a hail of smaller pyroclastics crouch down on the ground facing away from the volcano and protect your head with your arms a backpack or anything else you can find avoid exposure to poisonous gases volcanoes emit a number of gases and if you are close to one when it erupts these gases could be deadly breathe through a respirator mask or moist piece of cloth this will also protect your lungs from clouds of ash and try to get away from the volcano as quickly as possible do not stay low to the ground as some of the most dangerous gases are heavier than air and accumulate near the ground protect your eyes as well wear goggles if your mask doesn t cover your eyes keep your skin covered with long pants and a long sleeved shirt don t try to cross geothermal areas hot spots geysers and mudpots are common on volcanoes the ground around these is typically very thin and a fall through could result in serious burns or death never try to cross these during an eruption and otherwise cross them only on safe marked paths mudflows and flooding following an eruption generally kill far more people than pyroclastics or lava you can be in danger even many miles from the volcano never try to cross a lava flow or lahar even flows that appear to be cooled may simply have formed a thin crust over a core of extremely hot lava if you do cross a lava flow you run the risk of being trapped between flows if another suddenly develops remain indoors until you re told it s safe to come out keep the radio on and stay inside until you learn the danger has passed and you re free to go outside even after the eruption is over you might be advised to stay inside until the ash stops falling if you do go outside before it s deemed safe make sure your body is covered from head to toe and that you breathe through a respirator or moistened cloth drink only bottled water until the tap water is said to be clean if you see ash in any water source avoid drinking it 3 x research source if the ash falls for many hours officials might advise evacuating even after the eruption is over that s because ash is so heavy that it can cause roofs to collapse creating dangerous situations for people staying indoors stay away from areas with heavy ash fall volcanic ash is comprised of tiny glass like particles that are harmful to the lungs don t walk or drive in areas close to the volcano where a lot of ash has collected turn on the radio to find out which areas were most severely affected keeping away from ash especially important for people with respiratory conditions like asthma or bronchitis don t drive through areas with heavy ash fall either the ash will clog up your engine and ruin it 4 x research source clear ash from your home and property when you re sure it s safe to go out you ll need to clear the ash from your rooftop and other areas ash is very heavy and can cause roofs to collapse especially when it s wet if wind stirs it up it will be harmful to those who breathe it in 5 x research source wear long pants and a long sleeved shirt and cover your mouth with a mask to avoid breathing in the ash you might also want to wear goggles shovel the ash into trash bags then seal them and dispose of them according to your community s recommendations don t turn your air conditioner on or open your vents back up until most of the ash has been cleared away get medical care if necessary receive medical treatment promptly for burns injuries and gas or ash inhalation once you are safe waste no time getting treatment or an examination keep in mind however that you may need to wait a while if there are people with more serious injuries,Home-and-Garden
how to react if a power line falls on your car,having a power line fall on your car can be one of the scariest things you could ever face while driving if an active power line falls onto your car it can charge the car with electricity meaning that you have to act with extreme caution to avoid getting electrocuted if your car isn t on fire call 911 and stay put in your car being careful not to touch the car s frame if your car is on fire exit the car by jumping free of the vehicle without making contact with the metal inside of the car then still holding your legs together shuffle to safety with both of your feet together on the ground until you re 50 feet from the car if you come back to your parked car to see that a power line has fallen on it call 911 and don t approach it,stay inside the car if possible unless your car is on fire it s very important to stay inside your car once a power line falls when a power line falls on your car it often charges the metal parts of the car with electrical current meaning that if you attempt to exit as you normally do you will be electrocuted 1 x research source after the line falls look around the inside of your car and out the windows if you don t see flames or smoke you aren t in any immediate danger the safest thing you can do is to stay inside if you see flames and smoke refer to method 2 for instructions on safely evacuating the car if there are other passengers in the car communicate with them that the safest thing to do is to stay inside the car even one person exiting the car incorrectly could put you all in danger of electrocution don t touch the inside of the car sit still in your car with your hands in your lap take extra care not to touch the frame of your car which is very possibly charged with electrical current 2 x research source as long as you stay still and don t touch the frame of your car you are safe inside your car call 911 use your cell phone to call 911 give them your address and tell that that a power line fell on your car they will likely give you some advice such as staying inside the car but if they give you specific pieces of advice make sure to follow them 3 x research source warn people not to touch the car or power line if you notice cars coming behind you or approaching the power line from the opposite lane honk your horn to signal to them that they should not get near the line 4 x research source if anyone gets out of their car to investigate or try to help you shout over to them that they should not touch your car or get anywhere near the fallen power line if you don t have your cell phone on you and weren t able to dial 911 ask anyone who approaches if they will call 911 for you do not have them hand you the phone instead tell them to call 911 explain the situation and provide the address of the downed line follow the police s directions once the dispatchers arrive to the scene they will approach the car and possibly ask questions or give you instructions follow whatever advice they give you as they will be able to assess your individual situation only exit the car after they tell you that the power to the line is out and grounded and it is safe to get out of your vehicle 5 x research source make absolutely sure the car is on fire evacuating your car is risky so you want to be 100 sure that your car is on fire before exiting if you see smoke but no flames watch the smoke to make sure that it isn t exhaust coming from your car smoke is thick and won t dissipate quickly whereas exhaust will fade into the air if you see flames your car is definitely on fire and you should evacuate as quickly and carefully as you can open the door once you see that your car is on fire it s important to exit as quickly as you can open the latch of the door and push it open being careful to only touch the plastic latch and not the frame of the door or car 6 x research source the metal frame of the car is likely charged with electricity by the power line so it s important to have as little contact with your car as possible in order to avoid getting electrocuted bring your legs together and cross your arms after you open the door to the car don t step out as you normally would instead hold your legs together and bring them slightly inward towards your body rotate your body making sure to not let your feet or any other part of your body touch the frame of the car so that you are angled to jump out of the car 7 x research source cross your arms over your body to make yourself as small and compact as possible jump out of the car still keeping your legs together jump carefully out of the car and land on both of your feet at the same time keeping your legs together so that your feet touch the ground at the same time greatly reduces your chances of getting shocked 8 x research source jump don t slide out of the car your body should be in the air not sitting in the car when your feet touch the ground shuffle or hop away from your car after you jump out of your car get away from the flaming car as fast as you can instead of walking and lifting up one foot at a time shuffle from the car keeping both your feet on the ground at all times about 6 inches 15 cm apart alternatively you could also hop away from your car 9 x research source you may feel silly but shuffling or hopping may save you from getting shocked if you choose to hop from the car make sure that both of your feet hit the ground at the same time call 911 when you are 50 feet 15 2 m away keep shuffling or hopping until you are at least 50 feet 15 2 m from your car then take out your phone and call 911 tell them your exact location and let them know that a power line has fallen onto your car and that your car has caught fire 10 x research source when the dispatchers arrive tell them what is going on and follow their safety advice warn other approaching cars what has happened and tell them not to approach or touch the car or the power line shout over to them if they are within 50 feet 15 2 m of the power line or car do not approach the power line or car if you are a bystander to a power line falling on someone else s car or come back to see that a power line has fallen on your car do not approach within 50 feet 15 2 of the power line getting close to the scene is extremely dangerous and there are ways that you can help without getting hurt 11 x research source yell over to the person in the vehicle if you witness a power line fall on someone else s car instead of approaching the vehicle yell to the person in the car ask them if they are okay and tell them to avoid touching the frame or interior of the car 12 x research source say something like hello are you okay when they respond and if their car isn t on fire yell over i know what to do in this situation stay in your car and try not to touch the frame of the car or any metal parts of your car since they can be charged with electricity i m calling 911 right now so help will be here soon as long as you stay in your car you ll be fine if their car is on fire say your car is on fire so you need to get out quickly and carefully turn slowly toward the door of your car without touching the frame of the car open the door handle without touching any other part of the door swing it open then jump out so that you land on both feet shuffle away from the car and keep both feet on the ground at all times i m calling 911 right now so just focus on getting out of the car carefully be reassuring and let them know that you know what to do let them know that as long as they follow your instructions they will be safe and unhurt also let any approaching cars or pedestrians know what has happened and warn them not to get within 50 feet of the line call 911 if you haven t already yell over to the person in the car that you are calling 911 if they want you to call for them or are unresponsive dial 911 and tell the respondents the situation and location if you come back to your car to see that a power line has fallen on it call 911 so that they can deactivate the line and make your car safe to drive again 13 x research source stay until the dispatchers arrive stay at the scene until the dispatchers arrive if you have just witnessed a power line fall on someone s car it will make the occupant of the car feel better to know that they have someone outside who is handling the situation once the dispatchers arrive explain the situation to them again if the power line fell on your car follow their instructions until the car is safe to approach again 14 x research source if the power line fell on your car you will likely will have to call a towing company or mechanic to get your car taken away and fixed unless it is only superficially damaged,Home-and-Garden

how to survive being trapped in your car during a snowstorm,for most people snowstorms and blizzards are best experienced indoors perhaps by the fireplace with a warm drink and good company finding yourself trapped in your car whether relatively near others or in an isolated area can quickly turn into a shivering starving thirsty nightmare surviving in your car during a snowstorm requires calm so you can make wise use of your car to meet your two fundamental needs shelter for warmth and enough water to drink stocking up on additional supplies for this type of situation will help cover those needs and meet others such as eating staying dry and being able to leave once the storm clears,know your level of danger in most cold weather climates people know or learn what is reasonably safe for winter driving and what conditions are dangerous in most industrialized countries weather forecasting makes it unlikely that blizzards will arrive without warning even a severe snowstorm is generally expected several days in advance during a severe snowstorm travel should be curtailed unless it is a real emergency and even then consider if emergency vehicles are more equipped to handle your issue than you are if you are unfamiliar with driving in winter conditions as a general rule do not drive take winter weather advisories watches and warnings or equivalents seriously having to re schedule your vacation may be an inconvenience but getting into a car accident is a much bigger problem keep a few useful winter tools a more detailed list will follow below most drivers will not typically have an entire trunk full of emergency items but in most cold weather climates drivers should usually keep the following as a precaution sand or cat litter for emergency traction the weight of sand can also help traction in lighter vehicles although fuel efficiency will be reduced slightly cat litter has the added bonus if put in a tied off sock on the dashboard of drawing in moisture and preventing condensation on the windshield wool blanket in case of getting stuck this helps with freezing temperatures it is also handy for impromptu seating in winter events extra boots if you are wearing inappropriate foot gear your feet could freeze putting an old pair of boots in the trunk helps cover this issue also it is handy if you forgot your boots and it snows extra gloves hat scarf in case of being stuck in freezing weather these items are vital these can be old and mismatched but they should be warm keep your car well serviced before winter arrives or you plan to drive in snowy conditions make sure your anti freeze and windshield wiper fluids are full your wipers are working properly your tires are properly inflated and have sufficient tread and that your brakes and battery are both in good shape check to ensure all of your lights work and that your engine oil has been changed freezing temperatures and bad road conditions greatly affect how both the mechanics of your vehicle function and how your vehicle handles on the road 1 x research source have plenty of gas when the weather is bad make sure you have a full tank of gas in really hazardous winter weather watches and blizzard watches the effects of the storm can be 72 hours or more so the more gas you have the better in case you become stranded you will need it to help you stay warm to ensure your fuel lines do not freeze that your battery stays charged and that you have enough gas left to leave after the storm if needed 2 x research source 3 x research source buy a cooler and a storage tub your first priorities are supplies needed to provide warmth fluids and food followed by various instruments needed to weather and escape the storm a hard walled cooler to store both your food and water supplies is nearly ideal also get a hard plastic durable storage tub for the rest of your supplies it needs a tight sealing lid so if you must take it out of your vehicle nothing inside will get wet 4 x research source collect items for staying warm during a blizzard or snowstorm when temperatures are below freezing a person can only survive for about three hours without shelter from wind and moisture two of the ways a person s body loses heat since your vehicle will be your shelter you want to add supplemental items keep heat inside the vehicle using insulating items such as newspapers or blankets keep heat inside your body clothing and blankets for example do not provide heat or warmth but they re vital because they preserve or help trap the heat your body generates hypothermia which only requires a 2 3 degree drop in a person s body temperature is the chief cause of death from exposure to freezing temperatures the first effect is an inability to think clearly put one wool blanket for each person you anticipate could be in the vehicle in your trunk or in the storage tub plus two more for other uses wool dries quickly if it gets wet and keeps you much warmer than many other materials you want to also add an extra set of clothing for each person plus two sets of socks per person wool socks are best avoid cotton clothing such as jeans as these become essentially useless at retaining warmth when wet include scarves hats and water resistant gloves to help preserve heat in high loss areas like the head and neck and to keep your hands from becoming wet keep a pair of winter boots in the car in northern rural climates it is fairly common for people to keep a pair of boots typically old in the trunk in an emergency bad footwear can be dangerous in the snow leading to frostbite keep hand warmers in the car while good gloves or mittens are better prevention these are handy you can get in the camping and hunting goods sections of big box stores get 5 10 newspapers depending upon your vehicle size to insulate your vehicle s windows this will help trap in the heat your bodies produce the heat your vehicle produces if and when you turn it on and to serve as a barrier against the wind 5 x research source 6 x research source 7 x research source 8 x research source prepare for your water needs a person can survive for three days without fluids though it would not be a pleasant experience by any means to stay adequately hydrated a person should consume 64 ounces of fluids per day the typical water bottle is about 15 16 ounces which would be 12 13 bottles per person for a 72 hour period for a family of five that s 60 65 bottles of water an unrealistic number to carry in your vehicle at all times while jugs are an alternative the plastic used is more likely to warp and break when exposed to extreme temperatures therefore the following is recommended yes you can melt snow to produce water however snow is mostly air and produces surprisingly little water while a camp stove burner or campfire could potentially melt snow to produce water this is not ideal put enough water bottles in the cooler for each person for one day so for example you would put about 20 bottles in the cooler for a family of five if you have extra room load up with as many bottles as possible since this won t be enough if you re stranded for longer than one day you ll need to melt snow to do this you need the following a 2 to 3 pound coffee can with its lid several boxes of waterproof matches three 2 diameter candles and one or more metal cups 9 x research source 10 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source 11 x research source get the appropriate foods food is the body s fuel supplying the energy needed to generate heat when a person s body is exposed to freezing temperatures over half of the calories consumed go toward maintaining a normal body temperature thus the colder it is the more food people need in normal temperatures an adequately hydrated person can survive without food from 1 6 weeks depending on a number of factors in freezing temperatures that number tops out at about 3 weeks given that the average american eats about 2 300 calories per day half of which would be stripped away to regulate body temperature while trapped in a vehicle minimally each person should eat about 3 500 calories per day that is a quite a bit of food for a family of five over the course of 72 hours to make it all fit in your cooler buy dense non perishable high calorie foods such as granola bars beef jerky nuts trail mix canned fruits and chocolate 12 x research source 13 x research source 14 x research source 15 x research source scale down according to your needs most individuals caught in a blizzard will not be stuck for days unless you are going to be in a very remote area you do not need to prepare many days worth of rations in reasonably well settled areas you can likely expect help to reach you in hours and not days therefore you may want to consider having the equivalent of a solid snack these are often stowed in the glove compartment of the vehicle in snowy climates make sure this item is shelf stable and not likely to perish anytime soon this food should likely not be a favorite of yours as you will likely be tempted to eat it and not replace it when an emergency arises do not store water in glove compartment as if the water bottle breaks it will likely ruin your registration insurance card maps service records and so on the trunk is usually better if you are diabetic be very sure to have a snack available gather the rest of your supplies you ll need to collect a number of items to dig your vehicle out of the snow if needed to assist others in helping to locate you to be attuned to weather and road conditions to take care of basic needs if trapped and to improvise and fix unanticipated problems once you ve collected your supplies listed below put them in your storage tub regularly check to make sure everything is in good shape and working flares to indicate your location to rescuers a piece of bright red material about 1 by 4 feet in size a wind up or transistor radio with several spare batteries so you can keep tabs on the weather and road conditions also for entertainment as boredom tends to cause people to do unwise things flashlights with very bright bulbs and plenty of batteries to use at night and to use in signaling for help jumper cables which you may need when the storm passes and your vehicle s battery has died a collapsible preferably metal snow shovel tow rope to either a help get your vehicle unstuck or b tie one end to the vehicle and the other to a person s waist if it s absolutely necessary for someone to leave the vehicle during the storm a compass a bag of sand salt or cat litter to give your tires traction if stuck a long handled ice scraper with a brush a tool kit for any surprises a pocket knife with a can opener a wind up watch to keep track of time a first aid kit an emergency supply of medicine for each person for 72 hours one pair of tall waterproof boots for the driver of the vehicle tissue paper paper towels and garbage bags for sanitary purposes feminine products and baby formula diapers and wipes if necessary 16 x research source 17 x research source watch the weather if a storm is approaching and you don t need to leave stay put make sure you understand the difference between winter storm watches and warnings a winter storm watch indicates there s a 50 80 chance that a considerable amount of sleet snow ice or a combination of two or more will affect a certain area a winter storm warning means there s at least an 80 chance that one or more are on their way to a certain area a blizzard warning or watch signals that significant amounts of falling snow and strong winds of at least 35 mph 56 3 km h that will reduce visibility to less than ¼ of a mile are highly likely or expected in the next 12 72 hours remember while you may feel confident driving in blustery weather plenty of people you re sharing the road with are less experienced and mother nature hits even the most seasoned drivers with unexpected surprises if you plan to drive in potentially hazardous conditions always let a trusted friend or family member know of your plans and route 18 x research source 19 x research source 20 x research source unclog snow from your vehicle s exhaust pipe first if stuck if you find yourself stuck and try to dislodge your vehicle to leave you first need to turn off your vehicle and make sure your exhaust pipe isn t clogged with snow if it is clogged your vehicle can quickly fill up with poisonous carbon monoxide to unclog it turn off your engine put on gloves and dig out as much snow as possible if you don t have gloves use a branch or something similar 21 x research source remove snow and ice from and around your vehicle it you ve been stuck for awhile and decide to try to get your vehicle out start removing snow from the roof of your vehicle and work your way down while you re doing this turn on the engine and defrost to start melting any ice on your front and back windshields next take a shovel and remove as much snow as possible around the tires and the sides of your vehicle try to also dig a path in the direction you want your vehicle to go scrape your windshields last if you don t have a traditional scraper use a credit card or cd case to help remove ice that hasn t already thawed if you don t have an ice scraper with a brush to remove the snow from your car use the branch of an evergreen tree or a newspaper whatever you can find to sweep it off if you don t have a shovel use what s available to you such as a hubcap or a frisbee in the trunk 22 x research source 23 x research source rock and roll your vehicle to get your car unstuck turn your wheels side to side a couple of times to push any remaining snow out of the way if you have all wheel or 4 wheel drive make sure it s engaged shift into forward or the lowest gear possible on a standard gently press the gas and ease forward even a couple of inches is good then shift into reverse and gently press the gas to rock backward repeat this process until you hopefully get enough traction to pull out and keep going if your tires start spinning let up on the gas immediately because you ll only dig yourself in deeper by spinning the tires have a passenger stand outside the vehicle hold onto the inside of the driver s window and help push never let anyone stand behind the vehicle and push because the car could slide back and cause serious injury if you don t get anywhere with this look for traction elsewhere if you have cat litter salt or sand spread some around either your front or back tires depending upon whether you have a front wheel or rear wheel drive vehicle if it s an all wheel or 4 wheel drive vehicle spread it by all four tires if you don t have these materials use your car mats small rocks or pebbles pine combs twigs or small branches as traction 24 x research source 25 x research source escape early if you re able if a snowstorm is just beginning and you are unable to dislodge your vehicle try to get help by flagging other drivers and by calling authorities the situation will likely only get worse keep in mind however that distances are greatly distorted by blowing snow what seems near is often much further away thus leaving your vehicle is only advised if help is assured and in clear and certain sight otherwise you have a much higher chance of surviving the storm by using your vehicle as your shelter stay with your vehicle it may be tempting to try to get out of your situation by walking out but if you are in an area without a lot of human development this is often a poor decision the one exception by staying with the car you are in physical danger such as if it catches on fire or may go into a body of water a car is pretty good shelter and unless there is obviously better options in short distance such as a house barn or store remember that distances become distorted by falling and blowing snow additionally snow covers holes sharp objects and other hazardous objects so heading out on foot is a serious risk in the midst of a storm 26 x research source 27 x research source 28 x research source notify authorities with your cellphone typically most people now have a cellphone that they carry with them at all times before your cellphone s battery dies pinpoint your precise location using your vehicle or phone s gps call 911 and tell them where you are stuck and who is in the vehicle make sure to also include other relevant information such as how much water and food you have how much gas you have and if someone in the vehicle has a serious medical condition 29 x research source if you have enough charge left in your phone make one short phone call to someone you think is not also stuck and who will advocate on your behalf with authorities to ensure you are rescued if it comes to that make sure you tell them your location use your phone s charge wisely if you are in your car for days you may have to turn off your cellphone when you are done to save any remaining battery charge for later emergency use but turning it off also means you will not get any incoming calls or texts if you turn on your vehicle periodically you can also charge your phone as it takes relatively little drain on the battery make yourself visible to rescuers when a major storm hits sometimes thousands of people can no longer get anywhere in their vehicles some choose to abandon their vehicles others stay since emergency personnel will make rescuing people occupied cars their priority you need to make it clear that you are still in your vehicle first put on your tall waterproof boots over your pants and put on a hat scarf gloves and heavy coat so you don t get wet which you want to avoid at all costs if possible getting wet in freezing temperatures will drop your body temperature quickly and put you at risk of hypothermia tie the red piece of fabric to your vehicle s antenna as a sign to rescuers if you don t have an antenna find a spot high on your vehicle where it can blow in the wind or tie it to the door handle facing the direction from which help is most likely to arrive if you don t have a red piece of fabric find something in your vehicle to use responders will recognize this as a sign that you re in need of assistance if stranded in a remote area stomp out help or sos very largely in the snow to make yourself visible to those searching by air if you have access to sticks or tree branches use them to fill in your letters you may need to do this again when it stops snowing honk your horn using morse code for sos but only when your vehicle is running to conserve your battery do three short honks three long honks three short honks pause for 10 15 seconds and repeat raise the hood of your vehicle after the snow has stopped falling to indicate to rescuers that you need help take turns staying awake to be on the lookout for help 30 x research source 31 x research source 32 x research source clear the exhaust pipe regularly even if you ve already unclogged your exhaust pipe while trying to get your vehicle unstuck you ll need to do it more than once if it continues to snow and you are able to periodically run your vehicle s engine carbon monoxide poisoning can make a person sick or cause a person to die through both prolonged and shorter but intense periods of exposure the early symptoms are nausea headaches and dizziness 33 x research source 34 x research source 35 x research source use gas sparingly the length of time you might be trapped in your vehicle depends upon a number of factors such as the severity of the storm where you re located the capabilities of emergency responders and how many others are stranded it s extremely important therefore to use your vehicle s gas as little as possible if help does not arrive and you are in a remote area you may need gas to evacuate when the storm passes if you have a relatively full tank of gas run the engine every hour for 10 minutes while you re doing this crack one window to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning if you don t have much gas only run your engine 1 2 times per day for 10 minutes so your battery doesn t die and your fuel line doesn t freeze use the sun s heat to your advantage in this instance and run your engine at night which will also help warm you 36 x research source 37 x research source use energy wisely you ll have a limited amount of energy and will need to balance your needs with your supply your primary source of energy will be your vehicle s gas which then provides the energy for your interior lights headlights flashers etc if prepared you ll also have flashlights matches candles batteries and a radio to conserve use one possibly two energy sources at a time for example don t use a flashlight while a candle is lit to melt snow for water make sure you always turn off anything using a battery after you re done with it pull out the clothes and blankets to preserve the heat your body produces you want to layer up as much as possible trapping in the heat ideally each person will have an extra dry layer of clothes and socks to put under a warm coat with a hat scarf and gloves if not tuck your socks into your pants and your shirt into your gloves if you have them trap in heat however you can if you have a knife or another instrument like a screwdriver sharp pen or a piece of plastic or metal ripped from your car cut the cloth from your seats floorboard or roof and wrap up in it for insulation utilize the floor mats however you can too crumble up and put road maps paperwork from your glove compartment newspaper paper towels or napkins etc under your clothes for insulation use the wool blankets you stocked up on to warm yourself ration your hand warmers but use them strategically put them in your gloves and pockets when needed but also put them in your socks under your hat by your ears and so forth 38 x research source block off unused space and insulate windows remember your vehicle is your shelter or home just as you insulate your home to protect you from winter weather and close the doors in your den when you get a roaring fire going you want to keep the cold out and keep the heat in your vehicle first reducing the size of the space inside your vehicle will help with this if you have an extra blanket and a large suv for example tape the blanket from the roof down behind the backseat to seal off the area behind it tape newspaper to the windows to insulate them if you don t have a blanket to block unused space use whatever material is at your disposal you could cut out the seat cushions for example and lodge them in strategic locations to reduce the space in your vehicle if you don t have newspaper to insulate the windows look around you do you have magazines paper towels or napkins your child s textbook you could also use the floor mats if you don t have tape do you have band aids gum nail glue seek warmth from another person s body heat if you re not alone the person next to you is far warmer than anything around he or she may be madly shivering but 97 or 98 degrees is still dozens of degrees higher than everything around you and together particularly in smaller spaces you can actually increase the amount of heat in that area by huddling together create a cocoon around yourselves with your blankets coats or whatever it is you ve found to stay warm move your body movement increases your circulation which creates energy that helps keep you warm in fact your body puts out 5 10 times more heat when it s actively exerting itself in a situation such as this particularly if you don t have food to replenish your system too much exercise is both impractical and unwise nonetheless you still need to keep moving some when you re sitting move your hands and feet in circles flex your fingers and toes and do arm and leg stretches 39 x research source ration your food and water supplies you need to drink about 5 ounces of fluids an hour to avoid dehydration that s roughly equivalent to filling a standard coffee mug half full or about one third of a water bottle you should also eat a small snack every hour or so to help supply your body with energy to produce heat use your watch rather than your cellphone or a clock in your vehicle that relies on your vehicle s battery to keep track of the time if you don t have a watch try to gauge the time by observing the sun as it moves through the sky avoid caffeine and alcohol they both in their own ways speed up the bad effects cold weather has on your body even if one or the other may seem to help your goal is to regulate your body s temperature fluid levels and blood sugar levels as much as possible and to make your supplies last melt snow to make water because you have a limited number of water bottles or do not have fluids at all you ll need to melt snow first however never eat snow no matter how thirsty you are it can lower your body temperature to dangerous levels if you ve prepared in advance you have a coffee can waterproof matches and a couple of candles to melt snow fill the can loosely about ½ to ¾ full and light either a couple of matches or a candle to hold underneath the can don t pack the snow into the can make sure to crack a window while you re doing this because even small candles and matches can produce carbon monoxide if you don t have these supplies look around you what s metal or plastic that can be emptied or pried apart and used to collect and put snow in such as a plastic bag from the grocery store or even your glove compartment when you turn your vehicle on direct the vents toward the snow to melt it if you re out of gas put smaller amounts of snow in your container and set it in the sun or a warmer spot in the car to melt store your water properly water bottles can be stored in your cooler if you don t have a cooler but do have bottles wrap them in a blanket or another kind of material for insulation extra melted snow can be stored in empty water bottles or whatever you have on hand if your water gets too slushy place it in the sun or near a heating vent when you turn on the engine you can also store water in an airtight container and bury it about a foot beneath the snow even when the air above ground is freezing the air trapped in the snow provides insulation and will help prevent the water from freezing find food where you can remember you can survive in freezing temperatures without food for up to three weeks as long as you re adequately hydrated and have proper shelter it won t be fun but you can only survive three hours in freezing temperatures without shelter check your vehicle thoroughly for food you might not think you have such as an old breakfast bar that might have become stuck between the seats or sugar packets you might have in your purse from lunch last week if you find something don t devour it no matter how hungry you are eat only a small amount at a time and chew it slowly this will make it feel as if you ve eaten more if you suspect someone with you has hypothermia and isn t thinking clearly take extra precautions if he or she is also hungry don t let them leave the vehicle in search of food determine the road conditions if you re still stranded when the storm clears you ll need to make a decision about when and how you will leave much of this will depend upon your location how long you ve been trapped and how well you re doing physically if you have a wind up or transistor radio or enough gas left to listen to the radio try to determine the road conditions and if certain roads are blocked talk to others if you ve been stranded on a highway for instance if you still have charge on your cellphone call a friend or relative to seek assistance and to ask what s being done to clear the roads and or find you 40 x research source decide whether to leave if stranded near others if you re in a city or on a highway where others are stranded you have a high chance of being rescued once the weather settles and emergency personnel are able to maneuver more easily nonetheless if there are a lot of people also stranded it could take a long time time you may not have if you decide to walk in search of safety go with others if possible leave a note in your vehicle stating where you are going and stick to the plan so rescuers or loved ones will be able to find you if they locate your vehicle first wear multiple layers and bring as many supplies as you can without becoming overloaded if you have enough gas left and think you can avoid becoming stuck again try to dislodge your vehicle if you choose to stay with your vehicle make sure it s obvious to rescuers that you are still with your vehicle choose to stay or go if in a remote area very cold weather puts added strain on a person s heart and activities like shoveling snow pushing a car and trudging through snow covered terrain for long distances can cause heart attacks or make other health conditions considerably worse if you re in a remote area are in relatively good health and believe you have enough gas to reach a gas station a hotel or the like consider digging your vehicle out of the snow if you don t have enough gas you will need to make a choice attempt to walk to safety or do everything you can to make yourself visible to rescuers if you stay stamp out sos in the snow again and lay branches in the letters use a cd or break off one of the mirrors from your car to sweep the horizon frequently this will bounce off the sun and air rescuers will recognize it as a signal if you can get a fire started now that the snow has stopped start one and keep it going particularly at night for warmth and to signal rescuers 41 x research source if you decide to walk leave a note indicating where you re headed and again stick to the plan layer up bring as many of your supplies with you as possible make sure you leave in the early morning and take frequent breaks to rest and to drink and eat something 42 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to make a disaster plan for your family,natural and man made disasters can strike at any time even with advance warning any disaster from a hurricane tornado or a nuclear accident can catch you off guard and put you in grave danger a little planning and practice before you re in danger can help you and your family survive even the worst disasters,determine what disasters are the most prevalent in your area if you live in kansas you don t need to prepare for a hurricane but you d better be ready for tornadoes while some disasters such as fire can happen anywhere the hazards you might encounter vary widely from place to place check with your local emergency management or civil defense office red cross chapter or the national weather service to get an idea of what emergencies you should prepare for find out what you should do in case a disaster strikes the organizations above will likely be able to advise you what to do in an emergency they may be able to provide you with evacuation maps and information about local warning systems and emergency plans if you can t get all the information you need from officials research your local hazards on your own figure out for example what preparations you should make for a tornado or hurricane and how to survive if you re caught in a disaster and determine the best evacuation routes on your own if need be remember when push comes to shove it s your responsibility to ensure your family is well prepared pick a meeting spot and a way to get in contact with your family members there s a good chance that all your family members won t be in the same place when disaster strikes so it s important to have a predetermined rendezvous point choose a spot that will likely be safe and that is well away from your neighborhood as you might not be able to make it back to your home designate a contact person to connect your family designate a friend or relative as a contact person that you your spouse and your children can call if you can t meet up in order to minimize the chance that the contact person will also be affected by the disaster choose someone who lives in a distant town or in a different state make sure that all your family members have the contact person s phone number with them at all times discuss disaster scenarios with your family and make sure everyone knows what to do in all the likely emergency scenarios it s important to educate yourself on how to respond to likely hazards but what happens to your family if they are away from you or if you re killed or injured it s not enough for one person in the family to know what to do everybody should know the plan fix potential hazards in your home once you ve identified potential disaster scenarios thoroughly inspect your house and try to make it as safe as possible here are just a few examples every home should have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers test smoke detectors at least once a month and replace their batteries yearly or as needed fire extinguishers should be recharged according to the manufacturer s instructions and family members should learn how to use them everyone should also know how to escape the house in the event of a fire if you live in an area prone to earthquakes you wouldn t want a tall heavy bookcase sitting right next to the baby s crib as it could be knocked over in a quake if you live near woods with the possibility of forest fires you should clear your property of brush and high grass to create a buffer zone between your home and the fire teach your family members basic life saving techniques everyone who can learn cpr and first aid should take a certification class and keep their certification current adults and older children should know how to turn off gas electricity and water if the house is damaged and everyone should know how to detect a gas leak emergency numbers should be posted near phones and even small children should be taught how to call 9 1 1 or the corresponding emergency number in your country practicing how to use a fire extinguisher and checking smoke detectors are great reminder exercises to do once a year have enough water to last you 10 to 30 days during an emergency situation such as an earthquake your house may lose access to water and you may not be able to get to the store to get more water during a flood you may be surrounded by

local emergency services emergency road service providers and the poison help line practice your plan practice makes perfect and in a life or death situation you want to respond perfectly periodically go over your emergency plans with your family and update them as needed quiz and drill your family on important safety concepts do a live test with your family make it an outing and get everyone involved that will help you identify what works and what doesn t you should practice carrying out your family s disaster plan at least twice a year have contingency plans in the event your emergency site is unavailable or other things change it s a good idea to have an alternate plan on hand what will you do if your contact person is away what will you do if one of the family members is out of town planning for as many scenarios as possible can help increase your chances of safety locate all of the possible escape routes in your home get everyone in your family together and walk around the house to find all of the possible exits don t just look for the obvious exits such as the front and back doors but other ones as well such as first floor windows garage doors and any other safe

how to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning after an emergency,an odorless colorless gas carbon monoxide co can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled and every year more than 500 people die in the u s from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning when power outages occur during emergencies such as hurricanes or winter storms the use of alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating cooling or cooking can cause carbon monoxide to build up in a home garage tent or camper and it can easily poison the people and animals inside such structures fortunately you can take a number of preventive measures to minimize and remove the chances of any type of carbon monoxide poisoning after an emergency as discussed in this article,be aware of where carbon monoxide might come from carbon monoxide is often found in combustion fumes such as those produced by small gasoline engines stoves and gas cookers generators lanterns and gas ranges or by burning charcoal and wood the gas may be caused to leak by rupture from movement of a building or equipment due to a storm etc the equipment being used may be defective or there may be some other cause for the leakage of carbon monoxide such as inadequate ventilation carbon monoxide from these sources can build up in enclosed or partially enclosed spaces typical spaces where problems can occur include house rooms garages rvs boats tents campers garden sheds marquees etc people and animals situated in enclosed spaces with little or no ventilation can die from breathing carbon monoxide smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb f f6

how to build a one person emergency shelter,whether you are stranded in the wilderness or preparing for a tornado a safe place to stay could save your life in any disaster situation advance preparation is always more effective than improvisation stock your car or basement with emergency supplies now and learn how to seek shelter before you re forced to,pack a one person tent a lightweight portable tent takes up little room in your car setting one up is much easier and faster than building a shelter from scratch if you end up lost or caught in a storm this is also a good solution if you may need to leave your home at a moment s notice keep food water and fuel in the car as well or in a handheld pack as portable as you can make it build a shelter from branches or debris even flimsy material can greatly increase your odds of survival in stormy or wintry conditions refer to the linked article for full instructions or follow this quick checklist 1 x research source clear a patch of relatively dry ground insulate it with a layer of branches or dry clothing a good rule of thumb to have is 0 91 metres 3 ft 0 in or more of debris in autumn and fall and about 0 30 0 91 metres 1 ft 0 in 3 ft 0 in of insulation in warmer weather and 0 61 metres 2 ft 0 in in rainy weather cover this with a simple lean to structure if you have time and rope lean branches against together and tie them together if not just lean branches cardboard or anything else against a tree trunk or boulder cover the structure with branches or other debris as well as you can for insulation or a tarp if available pine branches with the needles facing down trap additional air pockets for insulation a top layer of leaves or trash increases rain resistance build a snow cave even a bare field of snow can provide shelter if you are able to put in a few hours work and the snow is packed enough to form a structure pile up the snow into a hillock large enough to fit you leave it two hours to harden then dig out a tunnel into the interior 2 x research source pack a compact snow shovel to make this more feasible in emergency situations if the snow is too powdery or if temperatures are too high which could cause a collapse dig a trench in the snow instead and cover it with a tarp keep shelters small if it s cold whichever type of shelter you use it should be just large enough to fit you the less space there is the faster your body heat will warm it in warm conditions you want a big shelter so it will keep you protected and cooler than a shelter that is a few centimeters inches from your face 3 x research source identify hurricane or tornado shelters no quickly constructed shelter will help you from winds at this strength instead go to a basement or failing that to a room near the center of a building with no windows 4 x research source come up with an earthquake plan a shelter is usually not the best option for an earthquake although you can prepare in other ways earthquake survival is based on two main strategies 5 x research source if the tremor is mild and there is a relatively open space outside no tall buildings walk to it through the nearest exit do not use elevators if the tremor is violent or you cannot reach an open space safely drop under or next to sturdy furniture and hold on construct a long lasting shelter if you own a house and are committed to disaster preparation dig out a basement or dig a bunker stock this with emergency supplies in case ordinary services are disrupted you can also get a frs or ham radio you need a license though for communication 6 x research source learn how to survive nuclear fallout an underground bunker is your best bet for protecting yourself from radioactive fallout in general the safest areas are indoors with as many walls and thick furniture between you and the outdoors as possible insulating the walls with as much dense material as you can find will protect you further seal all vents using duct tape and try to close all doors 7 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to live on a deserted island,the worst possible thing has happened you find yourself stranded on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere and are a victim of circumstance is all hope lost is there is absolutely no hope of being rescued on the contrary the opposite might be true it is actually relatively easy to survive on a deserted island even to thrive or perhaps even to find rescue provided that you know what to do,stay calm the most important thing for you to do at first is to remain calm and try to think clearly if you start to panic you can lose control and end up forfeiting your chances of survival 1 x research source you won t do that well if you ve driven yourself crazy william golding s novel pincher martin is a great example that illustrates how you can t do anything unless you take control because the main character in the story lets panic get the better of him try making a buddy out of an object or animal near you and talk to them to calm down you should make safety water shelter and food your main priorities in that order look around you and decide on some safety precautions start by asking yourself if the area around you is safe look around again and check if there are there any wild animals lurking in close proximity does it appear like there could be a flooding risk the first important step is establishing whether the place where you are is physically safe look for clean and fresh water supply almost all people who are lost out at sea are found in a matter of hours or days science tells us that the human body can survive up to 2 weeks without food but just 3 4 days without water 2 x research source so if there is no natural source of fresh water start looking for a way to collect rainwater any source of water is great as long as you have found a source of water you can try to purify or desalinate it later if fresh water is available try boil it for 2 3 minutes this will purify it 3 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source if you have a desalination device that s even better if not don t fret there are actually several methods by which you can desalinate water one such method is distillation to distillate water construct a solar still or one that works over a fire a solar still can be built by filling a large flat container with salt water or even urine which can be re used if the need arises place a smaller container in the center with a rock inside it to hold it in place cover it with a thin sheet of plastic or whatever similar material you have and place a rock in the center above the cup if placed in direct sunlight the water will evaporate and it will condense on the plastic sheet which will then run down the sheet and drip into the smaller container for a method that works over a fire create steam and condense the steam by using a large piece of metal or glass placed inside the steam this will allow the condensed water to run into another container create a shelter you will need a shelter as protection from the elements and from natural predators as well the best options are usually a natural shelter such as a cave or one that you build 4 x research source the next step to follow after having found a natural shelter is to build a more enduring shelter a shelter acts as a home base a warm and shady place for you to sleep in a place for storing your resources and a hiding place from beasts of prey as well ensure that the shelter above the ground so that bugs don t crawl all over you find sources of food the ocean is filled with life try building a low v shaped wall made of stones at low tide with the pointed part of the v pointing out towards the sea at high tide fish will swim into it and get trapped as the tide flows out there are a lot of edible roots and berries that you can actually consider eating but do remember to watch out some of these roots and berries are poisonous and eating them would probably be fatal only eat them if you are sure they are safe to eat the most reliable source of food on a deserted island are bugs yes bugs they can be found everywhere and they are an excellent source of protein too 5 x research source if you decide to fish with the bugs instead of eating them a hook can be fashioned by carving out a stick into a hook shape and putting a barb on it tie string to it and you re in business take the time to evaluate your resources 6 x research source have you found a source of fresh water do you have a long range radio satellite phone or any other means of communication try to find other people who might be inhabiting the island remember that people can be your greatest resource start a fire 7 x research source this may seem a bit trivial but on a deserted island fire has a number of uses at the very least it boosts morale fire can also be used to distill water to cook and to provide light for you and for your rescuers who can find you if they spot the fire if you can t start a fire don t worry just move on to the next step and keep on trying ward off dangerous animals if you know somehow that there are dangerous animals in the vicinity use a fire at night time to help keep them at bay if you have a fire extinguisher you could use that to ward them off in an emergency traps and warning signals such as snapping twigs can be used to prevent animals from entering your shelter zone or alert you to their presence act on all of the approved ideas together as a group if you have one everyone must work together and ensure that all needs are met and ensure that all your resources are put to good use bury dead companions if anyone in the group dies bury them and hold a funeral or in extreme cases cannibalize them 8 x research source this brings some closure and gives the due respect required while removing a potential source of disease as well arrange rocks or other large objects in a clear path to signal for help in william golding s novel pincher martin the stranded man actually built a figure out of rocks which could be seen by passing ships recognized mountain distress signals are based on groups of three six in the uk a distress signal consists of three fires or piles of rocks placed in a triangle or three blasts of a whistle or three flashes of a light each lit in succession followed by a one minute pause and repeated until a response is received 9 x research source three blasts or flashes is the appropriate response if you are in clear view of boats attempt to make a large red x somehow try to make contact with the passing boats build big and unnatural looking shapes with bright colors and something shiny use a radio if available to contact possible rescuers use signal mirrors fires flashlights and whatever else available on hand to draw attention to yourself this can be done while you wait never give up a desperate act can be lethal

how to handle an emergency situation,an emergency situation is any situation that poses an immediate threat to a person s health security property or environment knowing how to assess the signs that make up an emergency will help you know how to handle it in addition being well prepared for an emergency will pay off when it s time to handle any emergency situation,remain calm although emergencies require rapid action the most important factor in effectively handling the situation is to keep calm if you find yourself becoming confused or anxious stop what you re doing take a deep breath remember that to be calm in a stressful situation you must deliberately adjust your behavior reassure yourself that you can handle the situation 1 x research source the reason you feel panicked in an emergency is the result of your body s automatic overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol the cortisol goes to the brain and slows down the pre frontal cortex which is the region responsible for planning complex action by overriding your body s reaction you can continue to access your critical thinking faculties you won t be responding from emotion but from rational thought look around and assess the situation to see what needs to be done before acting seek additional help in the usa call 911 for emergency assistance use whatever number is applicable to call emergency services outside the u s this phone number will reach an emergency dispatcher who will need to know your location and the nature of the emergency answer all of the questions the dispatcher asks the job of the dispatcher is to provide quick appropriate emergency response she can only do this by asking these questions if you re calling on a traditional telephone or a gps equipped cell phone emergency services may be able to track your location even if you re unable to speak even if you can t talk call emergency services and someone will be able to find you to provide help it may be a good idea to go over how you would communicate during an emergency especially if you have a reason to expect an emergency might arise determine the nature of the emergency what signs indicate that there is an emergency is this a medical emergency or is there a threat to the property building that may result in human injury it s important to stop and take inventory of the situation calmly before reacting to the emergency 2 x research source an injury due to motor vehicle accident or smoke inhalation or burns from a fire are examples of medical emergency situations a medical emergency consists of sudden physical symptoms such as intense bleeding head trauma loss of consciousness chest pain choking sudden dizziness or weakness intense desire to hurt yourself or someone else constitute a mental health emergency other mental health changes may also be considered an emergency such as sudden changes in behavior or experiencing confusion can be an emergency if they occur without cause behavioral emergencies are best met by remaining calm watching from a short distance and encouraging the person in crisis to stay calm as well this way you can react appropriately if the situation becomes volatile know that sudden changes can be emergencies chemical spills fires breaking water pipes electrical outages natural disasters such as floods or fires are all examples of potential workplace emergencies if you have advance warning of the possibility of an emergency such the warning of flood heavy snow tornado etc you may be better prepared however the nature of an emergency is to be unexpected 3 x research source when assessing emergency situations be aware that the situation may be volatile it may change rapidly if you have advance warning of an emergency prepare ahead of time for the best results be alert for human caused emergencies assaults or threats of violence at a workplace or home are emergencies that call for rapid response in most cases there is no predictable pattern or method to these emergencies these situations tend to be unpredictable and they change quickly 4 x research source if you find yourself in an emergency of this nature keep yourself safe run to a safe location or find shelter in place do not fight except as a last resort being attentive to warning signs in your workplace including any act of physical violence pushing shoving etc should be immediately your office should have a procedure for workplace violence including a phone number you can call to report the situation if you don t know your office s procedures ask your supervisor or a trusted coworker open honest communication between employees and supervisors is part of maintaining a safe healthy workplace assess the immediate threat for example if one person appears injured are you or anyone else in danger of also being injured for example if one person is caught in a machine is the machine turned off if there has been a chemical spill is the spill spreading towards anyone else is the person caught in structure that s collapsing if the threat isn t contained this will affect your response be aware that any emergency situation may change abruptly so that ongoing assessment is required remove yourself from danger if you or others are at risk of being harmed leave the situation immediately if you have an evacuation plan follow it go to an area where you will be safe in a situation where you cannot leave find the safest possible location within your given area for example hiding beneath a solid surface such as a desk or table may help if there is a chance of being hit by falling debris if you re near a car accident make sure you re not in the line of oncoming traffic get off the road be aware that in an emergency elements are likely to change quickly in your assessment notice if volatile or combustible elements are present for example in an auto accident gasoline may catch fire abruptly help others leave a hazardous area if you can safely assist someone else in leaving a dangerous situation do so if returning to the emergency situation is risky a trained rescue person may be better equipped to retrieve anyone in harm s way offering verbal reassurance to an injured person if he is conscious will help another person even if you can t move them let that person know who you are and what is happening to them ask them questions to keep them conscious if the emergency is stable stay with the victim determine if you can do anything to help the most important thing you can do is to remain calm and stay in control of the situation sometimes there is nothing that you can do and that s fine don t be worried about admitting that there s nothing you can do to help if there are others on the scene who may be upset or fearful reassure them employ them in going to get help it s better to remain with someone in a supportive way than to do an action that may result in additional damage if you re not sure what to do simply stay with the person if possible take their pulse make notes of events as they happen and ask them about their medical history this is information you may need when talking to the emergency team take time to think before acting being in an emergency situation can result in panicked thinking and actions instead of reacting to a situation take time to calm down breathe deeply before you take any action things change suddenly in emergency situations don t panic if things suddenly go in a different direction than you d expected take time to pause whenever you re overwhelmed panicky or confused if you need to stop in the middle of taking an action to calm down that s okay get the first aid kit a first aid kit should have constructive tools for taking care of many medical emergencies any first aid kit should contain bandages gauze adhesive tape disinfectant and other useful items 5 x research source if you can t retrieve the first aid kit consider what other items in your immediate vicinity might be good substitutes you should keep a first aid kit at your home and your workplace is required by law to maintain a first aid kit a good first aid kit should also have a space blanket which is a light weight piece of special material meant to conserve body heat this is a vital piece of equipment for people who are chilled or shaking as it can help keep them from going into shock ask basic questions of the injured person it s important to discern the mental state of the victim in order to better understand the person s injuries if the person appears confused by the question or provides the wrong answer this may suggest additional injuries if you re not sure if the victim is unconscious touch their shoulder shout or ask loudly are you okay 6 x research source questions you should ask include what is your name what is the date how old are you if they do not respond to questions you can try rubbing their chest or pinching their earlobe to keep them conscious you can also gently touch the eyelids to see if they will open once you ve determined the basic mental status of the person check with them about any medical complications ask them if they have a medical alert bracelet or another medical id avoid moving an injured person if someone has a neck injury moving him could result in injuring the spine always call emergency services if someone has an neck injury and is unable to move himself 7 x research source if the person can t walk because of leg or foot injuries you can help move them by holding them at the shoulders if the person is afraid to leave a dangerous situation respond with reassurance use the telephone only to ask for help your full attention should be on the present situation and talking on the phone is distracting in addition if you are on an older model telephone the emergency dispatcher may be trying to reach you stay off the phone unless you re calling to ask for help if you re not sure if you re in a true emergency call emergency services and the dispatcher can help you figure out if emergency officials should be sent don t try to document the emergency unless you are sure you are out of danger taking selfies or posting about your situation on social media in ongoing emergency situations may result in additional injury and legal complications have an emergency plan the best response in an emergency situation is to follow the emergency plan of your home or workplace certain people may be identified as emergency leaders with special training in an emergency you will save necessary time and energy by following the plan and your designated leader even if you don t fully agree with them 8 x research source your emergency plan should have an assembly place to gather once you ve evacuated the home or building keep emergency phone numbers posted near the phone important medical data should be stored in your phone or your wallet know your physical address you ll need to know your location in order to tell any emergency dispatcher where to send help while it may be easy to know the address of your home it s also important to memorize the address of your workplace get into the habit of checking the address wherever you are 9 x research source if you don t know the physical address be ready to say the name of the street you re on and any nearby intersections or landmarks if your cell phone has gps you can use it to determine your physical address however this wastes much needed time in an emergency identify your closest exits always be aware of the exits to any building you re in whether they re home office or commercial locations identify at least 2 exits in case one is blocked in a workplace or public location exits should be clearly marked 10 x research source choose two places where you can regather with your family or coworkers one location should be outside the home or workplace the other location should be outside the immediate vicinity in case the neighborhood is unsafe emergency exits should be physically accessible according to ada laws take a first aid course having a first aid kit isn t helpful unless you have training to use it having training to properly apply bandages compresses tourniquets and other tools will help in an emergency the red cross regularly offers these courses in most areas of the us 11 x research source many red cross courses are also offered

children you may be required by law to receive this training know what chemicals are found in your home or workplace if the emergency occurs in your workplace you should know where to find the msds material data safety sheet for any chemical used having a list of the chemicals used in your home or workplace together with any first aid measures required in case of emergency will be the most effective way you can prepare for emergency situations 13 x research source your workplace should have an eyewash station if you regularly come into contact with hazardous chemicals make sure you are prepared to share any relevant information regarding chemicals with your emergency response team keep emergency phone numbers posted near the phone post the number for 911 as well as other important medical phone numbers including the phone numbers of family members who should be contacted the phone number of the poison control center ambulance center your doctors phone numbers should be posted alongside contact numbers of neighbors or nearby friends or relatives and work phone numbers 14 x research source all members of your house including your children should be able to access these phone numbers in case of an emergency for children elderly people or disabled people consider having a posted script to help them remember what to tell others when calling on the phone with an emergency

how to survive a riot,though it may seem dramatic an angry mob can be just as dangerous and unpredictable as just about any natural disaster thousands of people are killed in riots all over the world each year and these riots erupt from a number of racial religious economic political or social causes that cannot be predetermined if you ve found yourself in the middle of a riot you may not be able to run away immediately but you can take some measures to protect yourself from harm if you want to know how to survive a riot just follow these steps,prepare an escape route if you know you re in a riot prone area but have no way to avoid being there then taking a few simple precautions can have a big impact on your life though it s easier to assume that a riot won t happen in your area it s better to be prepared for the worst even the calmest crowd can turn dangerous when its members are in a frantic angry mood anger and hysteria are contagious so it s best to know how to avoid these situations if they arise get familiar with your area if you re just visiting a location for a season or two you should still get to know your surroundings as intimately as possible study a map until you re very comfortable with the area where you work the area where you live and the routes between those think about your possible escape routes and safe havens before anything actually happens crossroads are good because you ve got at least one road to race off down if rioters go crazy or the police start charging if you work in a volatile environment make sure you know several routes for getting home so that you have a number of methods of escape in the event of a riot carry small amounts of cash with you in case you need to quickly arrange transportation pay off looters or address your basic needs remain calm riots bring intense emotions boiling to the surface but you ll be better off if you can keep your own emotions in check your adrenaline and survival instincts will kick in but strive to think rationally and pursue safety methodically avoid confrontation by keeping your head down walk at all times if you run or move too quickly you might attract unwanted attention keep your loved ones close if you re not alone then the first thing you should do is grip the hands or lock elbows with all of the people who are with you if you re with a child hold them in your arms so they don t get trampled sticking together with your loved ones should be your first priority and your second should be finding a way out reassure the people you re with that you have strength in numbers and that you ll be fine if you stick together don t get involved if you re caught in a riot the last thing you want to do is try to take sides help out or stand out in fact you should stand out as little as possible as you move to the outside of the mob and away from the action to do this stay close to the walls and other barriers and avoid bottlenecks or any areas where a lot of people are squeezing through a small space drive carefully if you re in a car unless your car is the focus of the angry mob in the riot you should stay in the car and continue driving as calmly as possible try to keep to the streets that are clear of riots and avoid the main roads that are more likely to be occupied keep moving forward and don t stop to assess the situation if someone tries to block your car honk your car and keep driving until they get out of the way of course this doesn t mean you should hit the person drive at moderate speed so they have time to back off and realize that you mean business remember that you re in a position of power when you re driving don t let a few angry people stop you from driving your car and keep going unless you absolutely can t many activists are afraid of cars because there have been cases of drivers running down the protesters on the roads remember to be firm but not aggressive to avoid giving the wrong impression move away from the riot as calmly as possible if you re on foot you should move away by going with the flow of foot traffic not against it if you go against the traffic you re much more likely to stand out to get stampeded or just to get pushed or blocked if you feel that you may fall down in the big crowd and get trampled use your elbows to push down on the crowd so that it carries you though you may want to run for your life you should move calmly and relatively slowly continue to move with the crowd until you can escape into a doorway an alley a side street or a safe building if you re in the middle of a crowd it s especially important to try to move in the direction of the crowd until you make your way to the outside of the crowd avoid heavy traffic areas to maximize your chances of safety you should avoid the areas that are most likely to be crowded and should stay off the beaten path so you don t put yourself in a dangerous situation even if the heavy traffic areas are your quickest path home they won t be the safest path if they are the targets of any rioters here s what you should do avoid major roads major roads squares and other high traffic areas are likely to be crowded with rioters if possible stick to less traveled side streets to avoid the mobs avoid public transportation buses subways and trains will likely be out of service and stations and depots will probably be packed with people move to a safe enclosed area riots most commonly happen outside on the streets not inside buildings just by moving inside a sturdy and controlled building you can protect yourself from the brunt of a riot any building with a basement or even a sub basement can help you hide from a mob being in any building at all is safer than being out on the streets look for homes that can serve as safe houses in advance if you re really concerned about finding a safe space in the event of a riot if you can talk to the owners first lock the doors and windows and stay away from them though you may be tempted to watch the riot from the windows this will increase your chances of getting hurt move to rooms that do not lead directly outside to avoid getting hit by stones bullets or other projectiles look for at least 2 exits in the building in case you need to leave in a rush just look out for fire if an angry mob turns toward the building it can be a target stay informed use the local news radio and social media to alert you as to where to stay away from just as the rioters have started using social media and texting to alert one another where to go you can flip this on its head and ask people to help you know where to stay away from messages informing you of which streets and areas are currently being targeted provide you with instantaneous warnings of where to avoid social media may provide new information as rapidly as possible though it may not be as accurate so keep your bases covered remember that staying informed can help you avoid a riot even better than it can help you survive it staying on top of the news can help you know which areas should be avoided in advance wear clothes that minimize your amount of exposed skin it s best to wear long pants and a long sleeved shirt when you go out do not wear clothing that could be interpreted as military or police wear avoid wearing anything that looks like a uniform in addition do not make signs that can be also interpreted as a military gesture furthermore if you do not want to be mistaken for a rioter by the police avoid dark colored clothing especially black hooded sweaters since this type of clothing is associated with rioters in many countries around the world every crowd of rioters is unique though you can t do a costume change in the middle of a riot you should try to avoid looking like the rioters if you can for example if you re caught in a riot and are wearing the same sweatshirt as the rioters take it off carry a solution for rinsing your eyes in case you re exposed to tear gas if you re worried that you may be exposed to tear gas you should have a solution of half liquid antacid and half water you can find these products at many drug stores and grocery store and a spray solution is generally best if necessary use it to rinse your eyes if you are exposed to tear gas you can also carry toothpaste with you and smear it under your eyes if tear gas is released and you have nothing else available to protect you do your best to avoid being hit by riot control chemicals or weapons police may deploy riot control agents tear gas water cannons or rubber bullets for example to disperse a crowd these weapons and chemicals can cause severe pain respiratory distress and blindness try to stay away from the front lines of a riot and learn to recognize the signs that a riot control agent has been used and how to handle exposure avoid wearing oil based moisturizer or sunscreen as chemicals cling to these on your skin remove them with detergent free soap before going near the riot 1 x research source

how to build a safe room,your safety and the safety of your family and friends is the top priority if you live in a part of the country that has extreme weather such as windstorms tornadoes or hurricanes it s important to have an area in your home or business that can keep you safe during times of emergency it s also important to plan for safety in the event of a home invasion or robbery a safe room is a reinforced secure and well stocked area that can keep you safe in times of emergencies if you are skilled at construction you can build a safe room that will help to ensure that your family will be safe and protected no matter what the future brings,plan for safety before building your safe room you must take several factors into account to ensure that the safe room serves its purpose of protecting its occupants and does not pose a hazard it is crucial that you start by reading the government manual available at www fema gov pdf plan prevent rms 453 fema453 pdf this manual will provide design considerations potential risks structural design criteria information about air filtration and other considerations that will keep you and your family safe if you do not read this manual you risk designing a safe room that could put your family at risk through faulty design or construction however the details provided by fema in their p 320 drawing series are at least for wood framed construction only a starting point learn about the particulars the safe room s construction and design must be reinforced and built to withstand storms and threats of attack be sure you understand these factors as you plan and build the safe room there are 5 levels of tornadoes and 5 levels of hurricanes for instance each demanding different levels of protection if you live in an area that has never experienced an ef 3 tornado there is questionable need to have an ef 4 rated shelter for instance the room must be constructed out of material that can withstand high winds as well as heavy debris that may be flying around for instance in a tornado situation concrete walls are a great choice but if you want to adapt an existing wooden walled room you can reinforce the insides of the walls with steel sheathing 1 x research source the room should not have windows but if it does they should be very small too small for a burglar to crawl through and constructed of plexiglass to prevent shattering 2 x research source the room must be anchored securely to ensure that it does not lift or overturn in high winds or a tornado 3 x research source you will need to design the walls door and ceiling to be able to stand up to high wind pressure as well as resist penetration or crushing from flying or falling debris note that fema s p 320 design guidelines make no mention of the varying storm strengths and thus appear to be designed to protect against an ef 5 tornado which has twice the wind speed of an ef 2 that does not mean however that protection against an ef 2 tornado need be only half as strong a structural engineer will be needed to make those decisions 4 x research source you need to make sure that the spaces where the room is connected like wall and ceiling joints are designed to withstand wind additionally the structure should be independent of surrounding rooms in your home or business so that any damage done to the home will not affect the safe room 5 x research source a below ground safe room must be able to withstand flooding or water accumulation in the event of heavy rains 6 x research source the door should open inwards in the event that a storm piles debris outside the door it should also be constructed of heavy material that cannot be kicked in by an intruder or blown in by a storm solid wood or metal doors are a good option consider using an exterior heavy wooden door for an interior safe room and reinforce the sides with metal for added security 7 x research source know the best place to build or create a safe room the safest place for a safe room is underground a first floor interior room is also a good location 8 x research source if you have a basement this is the most ideal location for a safe room if you are concerned about tornadoes or other storms with high winds it is the most secure location away from exterior walls 9 x research source the garage is also a great option as it usually has quite a bit of space for construction and provided you keep the garage tidy less risk of falling debris during a storm 10 x research source plan the type of safe room you need depending on the number of people you need to accommodate the available space you have to work in and your budget your choices might vary the goal is to be safe but some safe rooms may be more convenient or attractive than others a yard bunker safe room is designed to be dug into and installed underground one outside door opens to above ground and you can purchase units to fit any number of people steel or concrete is your best choice because fiberglass shelters run the risk of cracking above ground shelters can be attached to the outside of a home or they can be situated within the interior some can be designed so that they are indiscernible to the untrained eye and other rooms are large enough to accommodate many people for example at a school or church these can be built or purchased prefabricated which is slightly pricier but will ensure that they are built to code if you are in the construction phase of a new home or business the safe room can be built into the plans as an additional room in the building obtain or create a construction plan before beginning construction its important to create accurate plans that are designed to government specifications this will ensure that your safe room can live up to its name you can obtain free safe room construction plans and specifics at https www fema gov media library assets documents 2009 you can use these to design your own safe room or work with a contractor on its construction purchase code guidelines to help you plan to build your storm safe room to code these guidelines are written by the international code council which sets code standards worldwide gather your supplies and begin construction depending on the plan you follow you will need various supplies potentially including concrete steel bars a heavy wooden door and deadbolts consider using anchors that are power driven around the unit s wall perimeter to avoid horizontal movement and uplift in relation to the concrete floor slab these are available for masonry as well as wood framed construction to avoid vertical movement of the roof assembly look into simpson strong tie anchors for wood framed structures be sure that your ceiling and walls are securely anchored to the bottom plate fema s p 320 design guidelines should be consulted but due to their incompleteness and errors with respect to metal ties be cautious wood framed structures will use plywood as protection against flying debris and on each side of the stud framing to strengthen the wall the layers and thicknesses will depend on what amount of protection you desire a layer of sheet steel or kevlar can be added again according to the amount of protection you need placing any inside protection on the room side and any outside protection under the outside plywood or you can fill between the studs with masonry units install a door with a 2 inch 5 cm dead bolt lock select your room to retrofit retrofitting an existing room in your home or business is the cheapest and simplest way to protect your loved ones from storms or intruders while building or installing a prefabricated safe room can cost between 2500 6000 you can retrofit an existing room for a thousand or less choose a room that is in the interior of the house with no windows or skylight and no walls shared with the outdoors a large walk in closet works well 11 x research source replace the door a safe room needs a door that can withstand high winds or being kicked in by an intruder and should ideally open inwards rather than outwards in case debris is stacked outside the room during a storm remove the existing door and doorjamb replace the doorjamb with a steel one and reinforce the surrounding wood with steel angle iron which will prevent the door from being kicked or blown in 12 x research source replace the door with a heavy solid wood door such as one sold as an exterior front door for a home or with a heavy steel door mount it so that it opens inwards rather than out 13 x research source install locks you can choose if you want to use a traditional deadbolt or a keyless deadbolt the keyless deadbolt has the advantage that you don t have to find the key in case of an emergency but can be dangerous if you have small children in your household who may lock themselves inside 14 x research source before installing the new locks and doorknob reinforce the wood around them by installing steel or brass strike plates which you can purchase at most hardware stores 15 x research source install the locks so that the door locks from the inside if it s a traditional deadbolt be sure to make a copy of the key and keep the keys in two separate but easily accessible locations where you can find them immediately in case of emergency reinforce the walls and ceiling if you are adding the safe room to new construction you can reinforce the walls and ceiling with concrete chicken wire or steel sheeting before adding dry wall and paint to the walls if not you will need to tear out the existing drywall to reinforce the walls the most cost effective way to reinforce the walls is by pouring concrete into the cavity between the 2x4s in the walls then screw plywood or 1 1 8 oriented strand board to the 2x4s on either side you can then cover this with drywall and paint 16 x research source you can also screw steel sheeting to the 2x4s and cover with drywall and paint you will need to use steel sheeting or chicken wire in the ceiling which can be done from the attic if you re in a one story home or applied directly to the ceiling less attractive but chances are good no one will be looking at the ceiling of your closet safe room contact a contractor for help if you want to create a more complicated or stand alone structure its important that it is up to code if you don t have a lot of experience with construction you can contact a contractor or local storm shelter company for help planning and installing your project ask around for recommendations of local contractors ask family or friends who have recently remodeled or done construction work or contact the national association of the remodeling industry or a local building inspector who will be able to point you in the right direction 17 x research source consider luxury details a basic safe room will keep your family safe but if you want to add additional features for a more high end safe room particularly for a very expensive home that is at risk of burglary you have several options a camera monitoring system a high end security system installed by professionals can allow you to monitor your home from the inside of the safe room in the event of a home invasion 18 x research source a keypad entry a keypad can allow you to lock the door to the safe room instantly in the event of a home invasion instead of wasting precious time locking deadbolts 19 x research source stock your safe room with food and water in the event of a storm or terrorist attack you may have to stay in the safe room longer than expected it s important to be prepared with essentials for your family as well as any unexpected guests who may have to share your safe space start with a minimum of three gallons of water per person that fits in the occupancy of the room 20 x research source its easy to see how supplies can quickly fill up the safe room space if you have a safe room that accommodates five people you ll need fifteen gallons of water store nonperishable food items in the safe room such as cans of beans or ready to eat soup don t forget a can opener boxes of cookies or crackers granola or protein bars and cans of infant formula or powdered milk while it s a good idea to plan for a three day stay in the shelter if you have enough space it s a good idea to store more in the off chance that a hurricane or tornado could wipe out the neighborhood you might need more supplies to help support your neighbors until help arrives remember to periodically rotate your supplies so that nothing expires or goes rancid even nonperishable foods expire eventually consider other supplies you might need in the event of a storm you may need other supplies to support you and your family until the storm is over or until help arrives you will need a battery operated radio at least one large flashlight and several extra batteries 21 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source consider a change of clothing and blankets for each member of your family be sure to pack a well stocked first

how to survive an abduction or hostage situation,it s really scary to think about being abducted or taken hostage but knowing how you should handle the situation can help you feel calm and focused if it does happen while the best thing you can do is to avoid an attack in the first place if someone attempts to kidnap you try to get away before they can incapacitate you if you are taken into captivity comply with your kidnappers and observe your surroundings until you can escape or be rescued,run away from someone who tries to take you if you can if you re ever in a situation where someone tries to abduct you do anything you can to avoid going with them try to pull away from them then run as fast as you can in the direction of the nearest people or building that you can see 1 x research source especially avoid getting into a vehicle since it will be much harder for authorities to find you if your attacker drives you a long distance if you re taken hostage the situation may unfold very quickly and you might not have the opportunity to run yell to draw attention to the situation if someone makes an attempt to kidnap you start shouting right away especially if you know there are people nearby even if the attackers manage to subdue you keep yelling to try to get someone s attention if someone hears a shout and they see what s happening they may be able to help you before you re taken 2 x research source try yelling something like help or call the police as a suggestion yelling fire is your best bet people are more likely to respond to fire and this can summon help faster at the very least an onlooker can contact the authorities and let them know that an abduction has taken place they may also to provide critical details like the kidnapper s physical appearance or the type of vehicle they re driving really try to get the license plate to see if the car was stolen or to see if it is really their car fight your attacker as hard as you can it can be really hard not to panic but if you can stay calm and focused on survival you may be able to fight off an attack if someone grabs you fight in any way you re able whether that s hitting kicking biting or scratching as you do that try to target your kidnapper s eyes nose throat or groin as these are especially sensitive targets as long as there s still a chance you could break free and run it s worth fighting for 3 x research source this is your best chance to escape because the moment will be hectic and there s a chance someone will see what s happening and intervene look for objects in your environment to use as weapons as you re fighting off your attacker try to gather yourself enough to scan around you look for anything that s close enough to grab that might give you an edge in the fight if there s nothing that you can use as an offensive weapon check for anything you can use as a barrier between you and your attacker like a chair or a table 4 x research source for instance even if your attacker knocks you down you might spot a loose chunk of sidewalk that you can grab to hit them with in your home you might be able to grab a heavy vase or lamp a fireplace poker or even a large book follow your captors instructions once you are in captivity if at any point it becomes clear that your captors have gained the upper hand stop resisting right away and comply with any orders they give you you re more likely to be hurt or killed if you continue fighting after you re overpowered such as if you re being held by multiple people put in restraints or placed in a vehicle or other confined space 5 x research source once you re abducted or taken hostage it s best to take a measured approach to escaping rather than an impulsive one so start evaluating your surroundings rather than fighting to get away if you re put into a vehicle while you re conscious try to pay attention to as much about the trip as you can like how long the car travels without stopping the direction of any turns or any sounds you notice on the road if you re in the trunk of a car look for a glow in the dark handle that you can pull to release yourself from the trunk if this release cord isn t present try to kick out the tail lights and wave your hands to alert other motorists that you re trapped inside 6 x research source stay calm and focused on survival it might be really hard but once you re taken captive try to dig deep within yourself to find your composure try to hold onto your dignity rather than crying hysterically or begging for them to let you go that will make you seem more human in your kidnappers eyes which may make them less likely to kill you 7 x research source if you can help it try not to even cry 8 x research source when you re talking to the person who s abducted you or taken you hostage speak softly and clearly don t be belligerent or uncooperative if you antagonize your captors they may be more likely to attack or even kill you 9 x research source try to connect with your kidnappers but don t pretend to support them it can help to talk to your kidnappers about universal subjects like families your hobbies or sports however don t go so far as to try to befriend your captors or defend their cause they re likely to see this as a ruse which could anger them 10 x research source if there s anything you want or need like medication or a book calmly ask for it it might help establish some rapport during conversations with your captors avoid the subject of politics or religion especially if you are being held by terrorists 11 x research source if you have pictures of your family with them you can even show them to your captors to help them see you as more of a person rather than just a victim observe as much of your environment as you can while you re in captivity pay attention to every detail this might include how many people are holding you their physical descriptions and any exits in the place you re being held you might spot something that helps you escape or you might be able to provide authorities with key information that will lead them to your captors after you re rescued 12 x research source even if you re blindfolded or it s dark you might be able to pick up on sounds or smells that can give you clues to your location for instance if you hear a lot of traffic you ll know that you might be able to find help if you can just escape the building other details to notice about your captors might include their accents their names or aliases and who seems to be in charge if they seem to follow the same routine each day make note of that as well do not admit to accusations if you re interrogated in some cases you might be taken hostage or abducted because your captors believe that you have information they could use for political or personal gain no matter what they do do not divulge any information that can be used against you 13 x research source however do try to act like you re being cooperative for instance you might answer questions about your line of work without divulging your company s bank account numbers find a way to communicate if there are other captives if you re taken hostage as part of a group or if you discover that your captives have also abducted others try to set up some way to communicate however avoid speaking openly amongst yourselves in front of your captors as they may separate restrain or even kill some members of the group in an attempt to subdue everyone 14 x research source you might speak quietly amongst yourselves when they kidnappers are out of the room for instance or you might tap out a message if you know morse code it may be helpful to set up a code word in case the opportunity to escape arises prepare yourself to be held for a long time depending on the situation you may be held for only a few hours but you might be there for days months or even years as you begin to adjust to your situation try to develop a daily schedule tracking time by outside cues like birds chirping temperature changes in the room or even your guards activities 15 x research source even if it doesn t seem very appetizing each whatever food they give you so you ll stay healthy and strong try to use flexing exercises like planks and squats to keep your muscles strong many of these can be adapted to work even if you have a very small range of movement meditation or prayer can be a good way to keep yourself mentally strong while you re being held fortunately the longer your captors hold you the more your chances of survival increase 16 x research source wait to be rescued unless you are sure you can escape safely if you re in captivity you re most likely to be killed if your captors discover you trying to escape if you see an opportunity to escape and you re absolutely sure it can work take it however if that s not the case bide your time 17 x research source tracking an abduction victim or negotiating with hostage takers can take a lot of work so it s important to be patient and allow the authorities to find you similarly if you gain access to a phone only try to dial emergency services if you re sure you can do it unnoticed an exception to waiting for rescue is if you believe your captors are planning to kill you for instance if they suddenly stop feeding you or if they seem very nervous or scared your life may be in danger and you should find any way out you can 18 x research source if you do escape get somewhere safe right away like a police station or a crowded building follow the authorities directions if you re rescued if you re found by the authorities there will likely be several chaotic moments where they have to determine who s a kidnapper and who s a victim for your safety get low to the ground with your hands behind your head or crossed in front of your chest don t run and don t make any sudden movements 19 x research source as the authorities secure the scene they may handcuff and search you allow them to do this then let them know that you ve been abducted see a doctor for medical attention as soon as possible once you escape or you re rescued you need to be evaluated by a doctor for any physical trauma you might have occurred as a result of the abduction however it s equally as important to talk to a mental health professional to help you process your experience as well 20 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source find a therapist who specializes in trauma to ensure you get the care you need remind yourself that kidnapping is uncommon when you start to feel anxious it s extremely unlikely that you ll face a kidnapping attempt in your lifetime keeping this in mind may help you regain a feeling of control if your anxiety starts to spiral out of control however don t beat yourself up over your anxiety it s normal to worry that bad things may happen to you or your family especially if you ve recently read or heard about a kidnapping case 21 x research source this may be particularly true if the kidnapping was in your area or happened to someone who resembles you take steps to be prepared in case a kidnapping attempt does occur everyone can benefit from some basic safety awareness like paying attention to your surroundings or being cautious around strangers however if you perceive yourself to be at a greater threat for being a kidnapping target take extra precautions to protect yourself this can give you the piece of mind you need so you re not preoccupied with anxiety 22 x research source for instance if you are visiting a different country you work for a political or social organization or your family is very wealthy you may feel that you re more likely to be targeted if you re in an area that s politically unstable pay attention to daily news reports as well as any terrorist threat levels and assess your own kidnapping risk based on that stay aware of your surroundings while you don t need to constantly obsess about kidnapping it can help you have better peace of mind if you keep your guard up especially when you re out in public or if you re around people you don t know well pay attention to what people around you are doing and trust your instincts if something or someone seems suspicious try to leave the situation as soon as possible 23 x research source whether you re traveling or you re in your home town try to avoid locations that have a reputation for being unsafe also avoid walking alone at night park in well lit areas and ask someone to walk you to your car if you re by yourself when you arrive at your home have your keys in your hand before you exit your vehicle if you have a garage open the garage door drive in and make sure the garage door is fully closed before you get out of the vehicle don t reveal personal information about yourself when you re talking on the phone in a public location as this could give a kidnapper information they could use against you try to make yourself as inconspicuous as possible when you re out in public avoid drawing attention to yourself as this can make you a more attractive target to potential kidnappers wear nondescript clothing and avoid wearing jewelry or flashy shoes also depending on where you re going you may not want to carry high value electronics like a smartphone tablet or nice camera 24 x research source if you re traveling by foot walk confidently and with purpose avoid stopping on the street to check a map and take care whom you ask for directions since you want to avoid giving the appearance of being a lost tourist change up your routine every few days kidnappers often study a person s daily habits before attempting to take them you can make yourself a more difficult target by making your movements unpredictable for instance you might plan out several paths to work or school and change which one you take every 2 3 days 25 x research source you can also eat lunch at a different restaurant each day visit different bars or meet your friends at different times or leave for work at a different time if you do believe you re being followed in your vehicle immediately drive to a police station or somewhere you feel safe if you re walking go into the nearest crowded public space 26 x research source if you re working for a government agency overseas consider driving a nondescript vehicle without any obvious markings so you re less likely to be identified on the road take self defense classes to feel more confident

another place to live where you end up settling depends on the progress of the war stay updated on the fighting and try to discern which areas haven t been touched by the war 1 x research source try to find areas that aren t near the main fighting these could be rural areas or strategically unimportant towns there may be designated civilian safe zones set up travel to one of these if there is one nearby rural areas may be safer because fighting is often focused around cities and population centers however remember that you ll need wilderness survival skills to stay safe here it may also be more difficult to receive aid since relief organizations also focus on cities find a strong brick building with a basement for shelter these buildings types can withstand the most damage and remain standing look especially for a building with a basement this provides added protection and a hiding place if you have to stay out of sight search your area for suitable buildings like these and move into one as soon as possible 2 x research source try to find a building that you can seal up in case there is a chemical leak or attack look for windows still intact that you can close and block off with damp towels if there are multiple suitable buildings in your area make a list of all of them and their locations this will help if you have to flee your current shelter and find a new one quickly if there are no buildings like this then find any structure that has a basement to protect you from the fighting build an insulated shelter if you settle in a wooded area if you flee the cities and hide in the woods your biggest enemy will probably be the elements construct a suitable shelter as soon as you enter a new area to protect you from the cold rain and sun maintain this shelter by fixing any problems right away 3 x research source locate the shelter in a spot that s easy to hide in just in case hostile people pass through the area to make the job easier try to build your shelter around an natural feature a fallen tree for example could provide the support for a structure avoid confrontations as much as you can while a war probably makes you think of fighting in

situation shooting for practice may also draw attention to you learn to use the gun as well as you can without firing if you ve never used it before don t neglect other potential weapons like bows axes bats or knives these can all help you fight off attackers train other members of your family or group to use the weapons as well your group is at a disadvantage if only one member knows how to fight defend yourself if you have to while you want to avoid violence in some situations fighting may be unavoidable some people try to hurt or exploit others during crises if someone tries to hurt you or your loved ones or steal supplies that you need to survive fight back when you can try to drive off the people who are trying to hurt you 6 x research source having some weapons at hand will help in this situation keep all weapons in a safe place away from children and grab them quickly if you need them if you do have to defend yourself or your family having a good personal relationship

potential water sources in your area do the same for every new area you move into 8 x research source nearby lakes and streams are potential water sources but you may have to purify the water before drinking it if you live near the ocean do not drink saltwater it s difficult to resist but saltwater will cause serious illness if you do find a clean water source use that and try to preserve your bottled water for emergencies if no other water sources are near you collect rainwater for drinking and bathing leave out buckets and tubs to catch the rain when it falls remember to purify all rainwater before you drink it gather canned and nonperishable food items your regular supply of food may be interrupted so nonperishable items are essential once you get news that war has broken out gather as many canned and nonperishable items as you can get them from the store or any other source you come across this ensures you ll have a steady supply if food starts running out 9 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source after the war has been going on canned items may be available in abandoned grocery stores whenever you find an unopened can take it you don t know when you ll come across more food try to avoid foods with high salt content that will make you thirsty these will make you drink more water than you would normally ideally you should have 3 days worth of nonperishable food in your home at all times in case of natural disasters or other emergencies if you have a stockpile already you can avoid the rush to the food store that will occur once the war starts learn to hunt and fish for extra sources of meat if food becomes unreliable you ll be at an advantage if you know how to hunt and fish work on your tracking and hunting skills to find other sources of meat also practice fishing for a steady supply of nutritious fish both skills can help you get through times of food shortage 10 x research source learn how to properly skin bleed and dress an animal so the meat doesn t go bad before you can eat it 11 x trustworthy source penn state extension educational organization dedicated to delivering science based information to people businesses and communities go to source you don t have to be in a rural area to hunt there are plenty of animals in city settings try setting up traps to catch small animals stockpile hygiene products if you find them while hygiene may not be high on your list in a survival situation it is more important than you may think practicing good hygiene can prevent illness and infection and also help you feel better when you re gathering supplies always include as many hygiene products as you can carry also look for more if you re scrounging or searching for supplies 12 x research source important hygiene products to have are toilet paper hand sanitizer toothpaste and toothbrush soap or liquid soap feminine products and disinfectant less critical but important products include combs or brushes razors shaving cream and deodorant these won t necessarily save your life but keeping up a good appearance can help you feel much better in stressful situations determine which plants in your area are edible almost all areas have local plants that may be edible knowing which ones you can eat could save your life in a desperate situation study your local area and find the plants that are edible then gather them regularly for a steady supply of food 13 x research source if you don t know what a plant is or if it s edible smell it first if the smell is terrible it s a good bet that it s not edible then hold the plant on your skin for 15 minutes and see if you feel any itching or burning if not place the plant on your lips for 15 minutes then take a small bite of the plant if you don t feel any burning or stomach pains after 15 minutes then the plant is probably safe to eat if possible you could also start a garden on your property for extra produce try to keep this hidden though if food is short people will almost certainly try to steal your produce avoid wasting anything all resources are precious in wartime so preserve everything you can reuse old rags to make clothes use food scraps to make stock catch rainwater don t let anything go to waste 14 x research source loot supplies if you have no other choice unfortunately people sometimes have to do desperate things to survive if you come across supplies or stores that no one is watching or look abandoned then take everything you need this might be ethically wrong but you and your family have to survive 15 x research source if you live in a populated area you may come across many abandoned stores don t hesitate to search them for supplies and take what you need if you re on the move stop and check any buildings you come across you never know what the previous residents left behind don t try to steal food or supplies that people area guarding however you could end up injured or killed for this learn basic first aid to treat minor injuries injuries are unfortunately inevitable and they can range from minor to serious develop at least a basic knowledge of first aid to treat the injuries you or a partner may encounter when searching for supplies take any first aid gear you may find and build a basic first aid kit 16 x research source wash all wounds with clean water only never use dirty or unfiltered water keep all wounds covered with clean bandages if possible replace the bandage with a clean one regularly learning cpr can also save someone s life in an emergency situation stay away from any weapons and ordnance you come across unexploded mines bombs and other ordnance are a major cause of civilian injuries and death in war if you re near a fighting zone there may be dangerous materials strewn out everywhere don t touch anything at best you could give yourself a cut at worst this could be an unexploded weapon that could seriously injure you 17 x research source keep yourself clean to avoid infections while it may be difficult washing yourself regularly is an important way

plywood sheets that are at least 5 8 inch 1 6 cm thick measure the perimeter of all your windows cut the plywood so that it extends 8 inches 20 cm past the window in every direction install plywood covers before a storm with bolts screws window clips or barrel bolts every 12 inches 30 cm 2 x research source when installing plywood get someone else to help you lift the heavy panels plywood is not up to code in many areas and is unlikely to lower your insurance premiums cover your window glass with hurricane film hurricane film is an affordable transparent plastic that you can leave in place year round measure the perimeter of your windowpanes and buy enough film to cover each windowpane entirely peel the film off its backing and stick it slowly to your windowpanes 3 x research source hurricane film does not prevent your window frame from blowing off and might not even protect your window from breaking however it will protect you from glass shards and will keep the wind out of your house homeowner s insurance premiums are not usually lowered for hurricane film keep your windows closed during a storm do not open your windows during a storm some people say this will lower the pressure in your house but the opposite is true 4 x research source do not put duct tape over your windows there is lots of misinformation about hurricane safety and one persistent myth is that putting tape in an x or a grid over a window provides reinforcement this is untrue duct tape will not provide protection from a hurricane 5 x research source order metal or plastic storm shutters storm shutters or panels come in aluminum steel or reinforced plastic and are all considered equally effective plastic is more expensive but will also let in light so you won t be left in darkness if a hurricane blows out the lights depending on the kind of shutters you buy you may need panels the same size as your window or panels that are several inches larger on every side 6 x research source all hurricane shutters have a width of 15 25 inches 38 7 cm order shutters h tracks and f tracks from your local home construction store or from a metals or plastics distributor if you are bolting your windows instead of installing tracks you will not need to buy h or f tracks purchasing shutters will usually lower your homeowner s insurance premium plastic will run you about 18 sq ft while metal will fall around 11 sq ft install your storm shutters or hire a professional to install them if you re doing it yourself measure the window height and the shutter height subtract the window height from the panel height then divide the result by 2 bolt the h track that number of inches or centimeters above the window opening then install the f track the full length of the panel below the h track 7 x research source for instance if your panels are 6 inches 15 cm taller than your windows install the h track 3 inches 7 6 cm above the window slide the shutters into the h track attach the bottom section of the shutters to the f track with bolts besides the instructions the bolts and the wing nuts included with your purchase you will need a screwdriver consider investing in fabric storm panels fabric storm panels are more expensive than metal and plastic panels but they come with some advantages once they are mounted they are very easy and quick to put up meaning it won t take you long after a storm warning to protect your windows they re also lightweight so you can put them up yourself and they fold up for storage 8 x research source find a dealer online or at a home improvement retailer near you in most cases your dealer will install the fabric panels for you if not follow the included instructions for installation fabric panels are just as effective as metal or plastic shutters and will also qualify you for savings on insurance pvc fabric runs around 12 sq ft whereas kevlar will cost you nearly double that replace your windows with high impact glass high impact glass is two panes of glass with a plastic layer in between them they are quite expensive but once they re up they will look like ordinary windows it will cost you up to 50 a sq ft for single glazed impact glass and 70 sq ft for double glazed 9 x research source double glazed glass is more expensive but it s also more energy efficient and may lower your heating and air conditioning bills purchasing high impact glass will likely lower your insurance premium hire a professional to give you all new windows,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a school or workplace shooting,although unlikely a shooting can happen at any school or workplace it pays to be prepared and know in advance what creates the best chance for survival running should always be your first priority but be ready to hide or fight for your life if there is no safe escape route,run away whenever possible your best chance to survive the shooting is to get out of the area as fast as possible 1 x research source only rule this out if the only escape routes would put you in sight of the shooter know the escape routes prepare in advance by identifying all exits from the rooms where you spend the most time this includes emergency exits fire escapes and windows ideally plan at least two escape routes out of the school or workplace in case the shooter is blocking one of them 2 x research source don t rule out second story windows or windows that you would have to break you can survive cuts from broken glass or a broken leg from a fall 98 of shooters act alone if you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire you are usually safe do not pull the fire alarm even as an attempt to evacuate others the evacuation procedures for a fire and an active shooter are completely different and pulling the fire alarm can increase the risk of casualties as a result 3 x research source react immediately don t freeze up or waste time debating your options find an escape route and start running if you hear gunshots in the distance you can likely get out of the area before the shooter arrives if you have shoes that prevent you from running take them off forget your belongings if you ve determined that it s best to run then forget your wallet your purse or your cell phone though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you none of them are as important as your life run directly to the exit do not slow yourself down with evasive maneuvers such as running in a zig zag or bending over as you run run as fast as you can directly to safety these tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you and using a weapon with a low rate of fire getting away fast is usually the better option the one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit in this case running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance see the section on hiding for advice on finding cover that will stop a bullet bring people with you as you re running encourage others to run if someone looks disoriented or too scared to move grab that person and drag him with you tell the people that running is crucial to their survival if you re running in a bigger group it ll be harder to target you individually and you ll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter grab a weapon only if convenient if you happen to see a sharp object or a blunt object you can carry while running grab it do not waste time looking for one of these when you could be running this is only for a last case scenario when you are unable to escape the shooters if you have to fight close distance is your friend get as close as you can without being noticed grab the barrel with 1 hand and cover the ejection port with the other try to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction the shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire but only once because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round that weapon is now a useless hunk of metal until the shooter can clear and cycle another round in manually perfect opportunity for you to take the weapon away and subdue the shooter choose this course of action if running is impossible it should only take a few seconds to determine if running is a possibility if the shooter is rapidly approaching your room or if he is blocking the only escape route start hiding or barricading yourself in immediately hiding is the second option because it traps you in one area however most mass shooting events are over within ten or fifteen minutes if you can avoid the shooter for that long you have a good chance at surviving 4 x research source split tasks with other people in the room if there are other people in the room get their attention and assign them to the following tasks each described in more detail below one person should call 9 1 1 or the emergency number in your region one group of people should lock and barricade the door one group of people should grab anything that could be used as a weapon turn off the lights immediately turn off the lights in the room where you are this will make the shooter less likely to enter the room and slightly increase your chance of survival if he does lock and barricade the door lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up and they re not interested in taking the path of most resistance lock the door place a doorstop on it and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter if the shooter is approaching get away from the door as soon as you can stay away from all doors and windows if the door opens to the outside a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment building one may not be worth wasting time and blocking a potential escape route if you re in a bathroom that doesn t lock loop a belt or t shirt around the arms of the door butler the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open call emergency services a mass shooting typically continues for five minutes before anyone calls the police if you have other people in the room to barricade the door calling immediately can be a big help once they ve been called law enforcement typically arrives within three minutes 5 x research source use a landline instead of your cell phone if possible so the police can automatically trace the call if you can t reach an emergency service look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by holding a lighter underneath the detector this should automatically call the fire department grab any weapons you can find look around the room where you re hiding and find anything that you can use as a weapon it can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find on the teacher s desk the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office beakers or dangerous acids such as sulfuric acid in a science room or anything that is sharp heavy made of glass or which can be used as a weapon hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room where you are even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people work together while this is obviously a last resort anyone who can t find a weapon should grab something to throw 6 x research source find cover the term cover refers to barriers that will stop a bullet brick or concrete walls steel building support beams or thick trees are the most common examples if you are trapped in a single room your best option is a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet ideally find a spot that does not restrict your movement if the situation changes you want to be able to run to an exit as fast as possible find concealment if cover is not available concealment hides you from the shooter s line of sight but will not protect you from gunfire if it s your only option hide behind furniture in closets or in any other hiding spot crouch low to the ground to minimize the chance that a stray bullet hits you most interior walls will not stop a bullet turn off anything that makes noise if you have time silence your cell phone and other electronics so the sound won t encourage the shooter to approach you try to stay calm though this may seem nearly impossible it s crucial that you remain absolutely silent tell people that whimpering or crying will only make the shooter more likely to find you be mentally prepared for the event that the shooter comes into the room and finds you in that case you ll have no choice but to fight as described below play dead as a last resort people have survived mass shootings by playing dead in areas where shots have been fired 7 x research source however some shooters are aware of this tactic and will target bodies the only time you should try this is when both running and hiding are impossible remember that attacking the shooter is your final option you shouldn t jump out of your hiding place and attack the shooter if he s approaching you should only fight him if you re sure that you ll be shot if you do nothing do not try to reason with the shooter or plead for your life trying to engage with the shooter ask him what he s doing or to plead for your life by talking about your family has not been proven effective in dealing with shooters don t waste your time by trying to talk to him you re much better off fighting work with others to create confusion if you are in a group of people and cannot avoid the shooter your best chance is to create as much noise and movement as possible shouting throwing objects and running will buy you a few extra seconds to leave the room or to attack the shooter if there is no escape route attack the shooter with any weapon you can use scissors glass or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter as soon as you are in close proximity even a sharp ballpoint pen is better than nothing you re fighting for your life and every second counts once again this is an absolute last resort most shooters are heavily armed and some wear body armor even if you have a gun of your own you are most likely at a disadvantage aim high try to hurt the shooter in the face eyes shoulders or neck or arms so that they are more likely to let go of their weapon you should stab them in the neck gouge out their eyes or stab them in the arm doing anything you can to make them get rid of the weapon or to hurt them so the weapon is within your reach kick him in the crotch this is more effective if they are a man although it could still hurt distract and discourage a female shooter if you can t go for their face or weapon this will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain commit to the attack once you are in this situation hesitation or panic can be fatal be as aggressive as possible attacking with anything you can do not try to run or stop fighting even if you are shot in the leg or arm report any suspicious activity keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities if a student or co worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school report this to a teacher or law enforcement you may prevent a disaster by doing so many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately 8 x research source be aware of your school or workplace s lockdown procedure every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked where people should hide and how the authorities should be called so if you d like to be prepared for a shooting be familiar with your workplace s standard procedure when it comes to shootings unfortunately it may be difficult to follow the protocol exactly in the event of a shooting but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible be prepared for a shooting though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting if you d really like to be prepared you should take self defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident if you have no choice but to attack a shooter do not run to law enforcement the first people to arrive are there to locate and deal with the shooter not to rescue people do not leave a hiding spot and do not get in their way if you are wounded wait for a paramedic or firefighter keep your hands up when you are within sight of the police raise your hands and spread your fingers to show you are not a threat keep your hands visible at all times tell the police what you know if you have any information on the shooter s location or type of weaponry let the nearest officer know move in the direction the police came from don t stop to ask police for directions if it s safe to move run in the direction the police came from keeping your hands raised and visible obey police instructions immediately do so as fast as possible and without argument,Home-and-Garden
how to install hurricane clips,hurricane clips are a fantastic way of securing potentially hazardous parts of your house in stormy weather these clips work by further strengthening the bond between the roof and the walls of your house so the roof does not blow away in a hurricane they are relatively inexpensive and if you want to install them by yourself then they just require a little bit of care and attention,examine your roof for diagonal beams you need to get into the attic of your roof using a ladder and inspect the connections between the diagonal beams and horizontal beams doing this means you can go to the hardware store and be sure that you are buying the right amount of clips you need a clip for every diagonal beam that attaches to a horizontal beam 1 x trustworthy source state of connecticut official website for the state of connecticut go to source always take caution when using a step ladder and make sure you have someone there to hold the ladder still purchase the h 1 hurricane clips from your local hardware store once you ve measured how many clips you need you are ready to go out and buy them buy a couple extra just in case you need more than you measured 2 x research source there should be instructions that come with the clips so hang onto these for future reference if you get stuck locate where the pieces of wood meet you are strengthening the roof by securing two pieces of wood one piece runs parallel to the ground and the other runs diagonally upwards to meet another piece of wood in the middle the diagonal piece meets the flat piece at the base and this is where the clip goes you may be installing these clips before the diagonal beams have been fitted if this is the case simply mark with a pencil where you anticipate the diagonal beams going 3 x research source position the clip so the gap in it is pointing forward into the house the clips have a space where the wooden beam can sit in it this space needs to be pointing forward into the house for the clip to work effectively if you are having trouble figuring out how to position the clip it attaches to the outside of the horizontal beam and there will be a u shaped gap where the beam sits in the gap in the clip sits just above the foundation beam so the diagonal beam can sit comfortably in it 4 x research source hammer in the clip to the parallel beam using 2 5 inches 6 4 cm nails once you ve spaced out where you are going to attach the clips they are ready to be attached this process starts with nailing them into the parallel beam these nails go through the base plate of the clip there are nail holes in the clip so you don t need to worry about hammering them through the metal of the clip if you don t have 2 5 inches 6 4 cm nails that s ok but aim to use nails that are as close to this length as possible if the nails are too short then the strength will be reduced 5 x research source position the diagonal beam so it is sitting in the open u space this is only necessary if the diagonal beam going towards the apex of the roof has not been installed yet if it has been installed then you must fit the clip to the beams rather than the other way around do your best to have the clip completely flat so that the diagonal beam can come straight through the open space without needing to be rotated at all 6 x research source hammer in 2 nails through the clip into the diagonal wood the nails should be 2 5 in 6 4 cm the same as earlier this process forms the second part of attaching the clips use a minimum of 2 nails here going into the beams these nails do not go through the base plate of the clip they go through the small extension plate the diagonal beam actually sits in there are holes in the clip where you can hammer the nails through so you aren t going straight through the steel feel free to use more nails if you feel that you need more to make sure the clip is held secure make sure to hammer in the nails all the way to ensure the clip is held in there as securely as possible 7 x research source repeat this process at each meeting of a horizontal and diagonal beam your roof or wall will probably have several places where these hurricane clips need to be installed how many clips you install is completely up to you however for maximum security install a clip at each point a diagonal beam meets a horizontal one if you do not install the clips at each opportunity these spots will prove to be much weaker in a storm and are at risk of being blown off 8 x trustworthy source state of connecticut official website for the state of connecticut go to source finish off by doing a final check over all the clips you ve installed when you ve gotten to the end and you ve installed all the clips it s important to go back and do a final check doing this allows you to make sure you didn t miss any nails check that the clips are connected in the right places and ensure everything is secure if you have missed nails on any clips simply go back and hammer in the nails where necessary to ensure maximum security 9 x research source,Home-and-Garden

how to build an underground bunker,planning for the apocalypse a nuclear fallout natural disaster whatever your reasoning digging an underground bunker and ensuring it s designed and stocked to help you survive is a big project but big doesn t mean impossible with the right planning and tools you ll be on your way to crafting a hidden underground bunker that keeps you safe in the worst of times,choose a dry location with gravel soil for your underground bunker locate an area with soil low in clay and water rocky soil is fine but more difficult to excavate so be prepared for more work if you choose this soil type avoid areas with natural gas pockets bedrock electrical circuits and shallow water tables 1 x research source avoid locations at the bottom of a steep slope if your only option is soil with lots of clay install a french drain dig a hole up to 4 ft 1 2 m deep to check the water table level thrust your shovel into the ground and move it back and forth and side to side to loosen the soil once it s loosened start digging and continue until it s 4 ft 1 2 m or you notice water start to enter the entrance height is the water table level if you reach 4 ft 1 2 m leave the hole and see how much water fills it after 1 hour the water table level is the level that the water fills up to 2 x research source repeat this process around the bunker area and average your measurements to get an estimate of the water table level don t dig your bunker in an area with a shallow water table which is 3 ft 0 91 m or less draw a floor plan for your underground bunker before jumping into anything ask yourself how big you want your bunker to be is it going to fit more than 1 person how much space do you want what are you going to put in your underground bunker after answering these questions sketch a floor plan along with the length height and width 3 x research source designate locations for the bathroom kitchen washroom and common area consider the furniture that you want to add such as couches chairs and beds write or draw each item to get a feel for where everything will be located purchase a shipping container for a simple structural solution the shipping container acts as the main body of the bunker and is the least labor intensive option for structure contact local shipping container companies and select a product with enough space that fits in your price range and needs if you want purchase multiple containers for a larger bunker 4 x research source standard shipping containers are 8 feet 2 4 m wide 8 5 feet 2 6 m high and one of two lengths 20 feet 6 1 m and 40 feet 12 m ask about purchasing used shipping containers for a cheaper alternative double check with your landlord or landowner that you can build your bunker prior to having your container shipped shipping containers cost between 3 000 to 5 000 usd buy 1 5 by 2 5 in 3 8 by 6 4 cm earthbags for a low cost solution earthbags are low cost structural materials that can be purchased from online suppliers if you re looking for the simplest method of creating your bunker structure this is the way to go after determining the length and width of your bunker buy the appropriate number of bags needed to cover this space 5 x research source consider a bunker that is 240 feet 73 m long and wide it requires 1 152 bags for both the length and width 240 feet 73 m divided by 2 5 inches 6 4 cm which is a total of 2 304 for 1 length and 1 width this means that total amount of bags per layer is 2 304 x 2 since there are 2 lengths and widths 2 per layer or 4 608 multiply the total number of bags needed per layer by the number of layers for the total bags for your structure for example if each layer requires 4 608 bags and you need 6 layers you need 27 648 earthbags in total 6 x 4 608 earth bag height will vary depending on how they re filled after determining how many bags you need per layer fill up one bag and measure it s height now use this to determine how many layers you need for example if it s 1 5 foot 0 46 m tall and you want a 15 foot 4 6 m tall bunker you need 7 5 layers 15 1 5 soil costs between 12 to 18 usd per cubic yard build your bunker from cinder blocks or bricks for better insulation head to a home hardware store to purchase cinder blocks or bricks for a very affordable price not only are they relatively cheap compared to the more expensive materials but they are also sturdy easy to install and great for insulation 6 x research source select bricks or cinder blocks if you live in an area with extremely cold weather during the winter purchase enough cinder blocks or bricks for each layer of your bunker for example if your bunker is 10 feet 3 0 m long wide and high and your cinder blocks are 1 foot 0 30 m long wide and high you need 40 for each layer a total of 2 lengths and 2 widths across 10 layers high for a total of 400 40 x 10 dig a hole 2 feet 0 61 m deeper than your bunker s height thrust your shovel down into the soil and move it forward and backward and side to side to loosen it after loosening it grasp the center of the handle with your non dominant hand and grip the top of it with your dominant hand now start digging your bunker hole from the perimeter of your bunker hole and move inward use your foot to firmly press straight down onto the shovel 7 x research source use a reciprocating saw or the tip of your shovel to saw through large roots loosen rocks with a steel bar consider hiring or renting heavy equipment to dig your hole call 811 3 to 4 days prior to digging to make sure you can do so without damaging underground electrical structures or piping place your shipping container into the hole if you re using one speak to the company you purchased your container from about shipping costs and procedure local companies will be cheaper while international companies will be significantly more expensive most companies charge a flat rate per 1 mile 1 6 km 8 x research source fill and stack your earthbags with 15 25 clay soil if applicable if you re making an earthbag structure head to a local garden or big box store and look for a sandy soil product with the appropriate clay levels the rest of the soil should be made mostly of sandy aggregate now start stacking the first row of bags afterward start stacking your second row making sure that each bag covers 1 2 of the 2 sandbags underneath it continue this process until the top of your sandbags are level with the ground 9 x research source although 5 35 clay works too the ideal amount is 15 25 so stick to that whenever possible don t use heavy clay as it will contract when it dries and expand when wet ask a garden store worker for soils that are used for cob rammed earth walls and adobe blocks dump out any soil from your sandbags as needed to create corner pieces lay bricks or cinder blocks and attach each piece with mortar for this type of bunker start placing your bricks onto a concrete foundation and attach each piece with 3 8 inch 0 95 cm of mortar work your way up about 2 to 3 courses on each side of the brick lines to create a shallow u before filling the middle 10 x research source double check that you have enough cinder blocks or bricks for each layer of your bunker before starting your foundation should be the same length and width as your bunker structure and about 1 foot 0 30 m deep use a spirit level to check the leveling after every 4 to 5 bricks stagger each layer or brick with a half piece to give it stability use 4 mm 0 16 in sheet metal roofing for earth bag or cinderblock structures sheet metal is the best roofing material if you re not using a shipping container wood isn t recommended for a roof due to its susceptibility to rot and weathering if you re on a tight budget and want to purchase wood make sure you use pressure treated wood install air vents in your roof find the net free area nfa of your vents compare it to your bunker s square footage and make sure the nfa is more if not add more vents until the total nfa is more than the square footage afterward outline 7 by 15 inch 18 by 38 cm rectangles on the ceiling for each vent now drill holes into the outside corners of the rectangle and then remove it using a jigsaw always start by inserting the blade through one of the holes afterward place a soffit vent over the rectangular holes and drill it into place with 4 to 6 screws 11 x research source cover the air vents on the surface with brush and rocks always start by installing the corner screws of the vents for stability set your saw to medium speed and always follow the outline slowly and carefully invest in an air filtration system for maximum air quality cover your bunker with 5 to 6 mm 0 20 to 0 24 in silo plastic silo plastic protects your bunker from water and other environmental waste while still allowing oxygen transmission purchase silo plastic from an online supplier for the best options multiply your bunker s length by its height to get the area of the roof you need to cover and purchase at least this amount 12 x research source weight the silo plastic down with gravel bags tires tire sidewalls or other ballast material purchase 2 layers of silo plastic for extra protection swap silo plastic with a plastic tarp or cover for a cheaper alternative however bear in mind it won t be as effective hide the roof of your underground bunker from view to prevent people from discovering your bunker cover it with dirt and local fauna try your best to ensure that it blends into the surrounding environment as much as possible 13 x research source use tire sidewalls as opposed to tires whenever possible to prevent water buildup and rodent habitat formation build a shed on top of your bunker s entrance to conceal it place an outhouse on top of the entrance to your bunker add some bushes and rocks from your excavation power your bunker with batteries solar panels and generators invest in no less than eight 6 volt gel cell batteries in your bunker at all times in addition consider investing in solar panels and electrical generators for long term power sources just remember to run your electrical generator outside when you need to use it 14 x research source use batteries to power lights and radio communication for the highest efficiency choose diesel generators as opposed to propane or gasoline invest in a diesel generator 2kw or smaller to charge your batteries call a local power company and inquire about installation costs invest in water tanks filters and heaters you ll be outfitting your bunker with a toilet later so you can focus on creating clean water or your consumption purchase a water tank to store your water and consider investing in a filter and heater 15 x research source skip the water heater if you don t mind cold water but remember that you ll be missing out on hot water during the winter fill your bunker with at least 3 days worth of non perishable foods and water start by filling your bunker with 3 day s worth of food and gradually add to it over time dehydrated meals canned goods dried pemmican and rice stored in mylar bags are all great choices but anything with a long shelf life works bottled water is the simplest option although you can invest in a water tank if you re willing to spend the money if you re planning to house more than one person be sure to account for extra food and water 16 x research source some canned foods examples include yams carrots peas green beans fruits chili chicken turkey tuna and salmon dry foods you can purchase include raisins mangos apples apricots rice flour nuts cereal granola powdered milk and pet kibble buy some crackers beans canned meat dried chickpeas and gelatin desserts don t forget some comfort foods such as your favorite candy tea or coffee stock your bunker with survival gear flashlights a radio self powered or battery powered toilet paper soap fire extinguisher and clothing are all the basics in addition you should stock some tweezers scissors a thermometer latex gloves and lubricant keep a stash of non prescription drugs like aspirin antacids laxatives eye wash rubbing alcohol and antiseptic create a sleeping area for rest be sure to add some blankets or sleeping bags one change of clothing for each person work boots or sturdy shoes thermal underwear and rain gear aside from these basics add whatever else you want for comfort 17 x research source add some portable heaters for winter weather add a portable camping or composing toilet to your bathroom area portable camping toilets require you to get rid of the waste yourself while composting toilets turn it into fertilizer obviously the latter is more ideal for long term stays and situations when you can t leave your bunker 18 x research source stock your washroom area with toilet paper and cleaning supplies stock your kitchen area with cooking tools start by stocking your kitchen with an electric burner or microwave oven never propane or gas stoves which create dangerous levels of carbon monoxide for emergency situations keep a marine alcohol stove handy 19 x research source purchase alcohol fuel from a marine or hardware store keep your utensils pots pans and other cooking supplies in your kitchen area create a common area for relaxing add a small carpet couch and some chairs to relax afterward add some entertainment cards board games books a television video games movies dominoes and anything else to keep you occupied 20 x research source add a small coffee table to make

how to desalinate water,desalination or the removal or salt from water can be used to produce drinkable water from seawater or brackish water 1 x research source scientists are studying ways to use desalination on a global scale but you can desalinate water yourself with just a mug a bowl and some sunlight,use bottled drinking water and iodized salt before you can desalinate the water you will need to create saline water or salt water do this by buying a bottle of drinking water and iodized salt from your local grocery store you can also use a bottle of tap water if you do not want to buy a bottle of water 2 x research source if you happen to live near an ocean you can skip these materials and fill a bottle with seawater seawater is full of salt and great for use in the desalination process get a heavy ceramic mug and a large glass bowl you will use the ceramic mug as a container for the desalinated water and the large glass bowl will act as a receptacle for the salt during the desalination process the glass bowl should be big enough to fit the mug 3 x research source you will also need a piece of plastic cling wrap enough to go over the glass bowl and a small weight like a rock make sure you have access to a spot with direct sunlight like a window sill you will need to place your desalination device in direct sunlight to warm up the water in the device and create humid air the humid air will then condense into water droplets that you can drink 4 x research source pour 1 inch of drinking water into the mug you do not want to fill the mug up too much just until it appears 1 inch deep with water 5 x research source mix enough salt into the water so it tastes salty start with a small amount of iodized salt and taste it to ensure it is salty make sure you fill the mug with more water if you drink some of it as you want there to be a depth of about 1 inch of water in the mug put the salt water into the large glass bowl you will then need to rinse and dry the mug to ensure there is not salt residue in the mug 6 x research source once you have rinsed and dried the mug you can put it in the center of the glass bowl in the 1 inch of salt water cover the glass bowl with plastic cling wrap make sure the cling wrap is stretched tightly over the mug and the sides of the bowl with no open areas around the rim of the bowl place the bowl in direct sunlight look for a window sill or a spot on your deck outside that gets lots of direct sunlight and make sure the bowl is on a nice even surface in the sun 7 x research source place the small weight or rock on the top of the plastic wrap right above the cup the plastic wrap should sag in the center of the cup due to the weight of the rock this will ensure the condensed water falls into the cup so you can drink it leave the bowl in the sun for three to four hours after several hours in the sun there will be a build up of humid air in the bowl this will lead to the formation of water condensation on the plastic wrap the water droplets should then flow downward into the cup check the cup for fresh water after the bowl has been in the sun for three to four hours check the cup for a small amount of water remove the plastic wrap and drink the water in the cup you should taste pure clean fresh water that has been desalinated 8 x research source this desalination device works by using the sun to warm up the salt water the plastic wrap helps to trap the water vapors in the bowl as the salt water evaporates because the top of the plastic wrap is much cooler than the rest of the bowl the humid air in the bowl condenses on the top of the plastic wrap and forms water droplets over time the water droplets on the plastic wrap grow larger and start to flow to the center of the bowl due to the weight of the rock as the water droplets build up they grow heavier and eventually fall into the cup the result of this simple desalination device is a cup of fresh drinking water that does not contain any salt,Home-and-Garden
how to board up a window,if your windows aren t impact resistant you ll probably want to board them up if a big storm or hurricane is about to hit it may seem like a pretty daunting task to board up the windows of a house especially if you ve never done it before fortunately whether your house has vinyl brick or stucco siding the process of installing plywood over the windows is relatively straightforward simply screw the plywood over the entire window or use clips to install the plywood inside the window frame,record the vertical and horizontal measurements for the window use a tape measure to determine the height and width of the window you plan to board up and write these measurements down if the window has an extended sill measure vertically from the top of the sill to the top of the window 1 x research source when measuring horizontally measure inside the window s exterior trim cut a piece of plywood that is 8 inches 20 cm higher and wider than the window add 8 inches 20 cm to the height and width measurements you took of the window then use these new measurements to measure and cut your plywood use a circular saw to cut the plywood 2 x research source for example if your window measures 48 inches 120 cm tall and 24 inches 61 cm wide then your piece of plywood should be 56 inches 140 cm tall and 32 inches 81 cm wide if the window has an extended sill you only need to add 4 inches 10 cm to the height before cutting the plywood if you don t have a circular saw you can take your plywood to a home improvement store to have it cut for you attach 2 pieces of plywood together if you need a bigger piece most pieces of plywood are 4 by 8 feet 1 2 by 2 4 m so if your window s dimensions are larger than this you ll need to use 2 pieces of plywood attached to each other place 2 plywood pieces next to each other then lay a 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm bracing along the seam finally drill 2 25 in 5 7 cm screws through the bracing and into the plywood to attach them all 3 x research source drill at least 6 screws 2 at the top of the bracing 2 in the middle and 2 at the bottom through the bracing and into the 2 pieces of plywood to make sure they re securely attached use a stud finder to find the studs in the wall around the window frame you ll want to make sure you re not attaching the plywood merely to trim around the wall since this won t be secure look for the studs 4 inches 10 cm out from each side of the window frame 4 x research source if you don t have a stud finder you may be able to determine where the stud is by looking for nailheads in the siding since these nails have probably been nailed into the stud drill holes in the corners of the plywood that align with the studs drill 4 holes that are each around 2 inches 5 1 cm in from the edges of the plywood at each corner you may need to adjust this measurement to ensure that the holes you drill will line up with the studs in the wall when you go to screw in the plywood 5 x research source make sure the holes you drill are equal in diameter to the screws you will use to attach the plywood to the wall use 1 4 in 0 64 cm pan head or lag screws for the best results these holes in the plywood are called pilot holes they should be drilled all the way through the plywood make additional holes at 12 in 30 cm intervals around the plywood these holes are where you will screw the plywood into the wall align these holes with the corner holes you already drilled to ensure that these new holes will also line up with the studs in the wall 6 x research source if the window has a sill that extends out at the bottom you only need to drill these holes on the top and sides of the plywood these holes should also be around 2 inches 5 1 cm from the edge of the plywood note that the holes in the top and bottom of the plywood will not be screwed into the studs in the wall place the plywood over the window frame and use a drill to screw it in have someone hold the board while you drill screws through each of the pilot holes or vice versa use pan head or lag screws that will penetrate at least 2 inches 5 1 cm into the framing 7 x research source these types of screws are best since their flat bottomed heads won t sink into the plywood and weaken it use corrosion resistant screws if you re boarding up your window in advance of a hurricane or other major storm measure the height and width of the window you re boarding up determine the height and width of the window with a tape measure making sure to write your measurements down measure from the top of the window frame interior to the bottom as well as from side to side don t measure beyond the frame itself 8 x research source your plywood piece will be cut to fit inside the window frame so there s no need to measure beyond it cut a piece of plywood to match the window s dimensions use a circular saw to cut the plywood to match the height and width of the window frame you ll be placing the piece of plywood snugly within the frame so the measurements of the plywood should be as close as possible to the dimensions of the window 9 x research source for example if your window frame measures 48 inches 120 cm tall and 24 inches 61 cm wide then your piece of plywood should be 48 inches 120 cm tall and 24 inches 61 cm wide as well take your plywood to a home improvement store to have it cut for you if you don t have a circular saw use 2 pieces of plywood attached to each other if the frame is too big you ll need to use 2 pieces of plywood attached to each other with a 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm bracing along the seam if your window frame is bigger than 4 by 8 feet 1 2 by 2 4 m place 2 plywood pieces next to each other with a 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm bracing placed along the seam then drill 2 25 in 5 7 cm screws through the bracing and into the plywood to attach them all 10 x research source drill at least 6 screws 2 at the top of the bracing 2 in the middle and 2 at the bottom through the bracing and into the 2 pieces of plywood to make sure they re securely attached to each other use a hammer to attach 4 window clips to the sides of the plywood place 2 clips on each side of the plywood positioned so that the tension legs are facing towards you then gently tap the clips with the hammer to attach them to the plywood be sure to place each pair of clips no more than 2 feet 0 61 m apart from each other 11 x research source position the clips so that they re evenly spaced from each other for best results you may be able to simply push the clips into place however using a hammer will ensure that they are as securely attached to the plywood as possible place the plywood over the window frame and push it in to secure it when you do this make sure the clips are securely gripping the sides of the frame and aren t being pushed out of it push the plywood as far into the frame as it can go 12 x research source strong winds generate lift on the plywood that can cause it to be pulled out of the window frame if the window clips are securely gripping the sides of the frame they will keep the plywood in place when you re ready to remove the plywood simply push down on the board and pull up on the window clips on 1 side to remove it,Home-and-Garden
how to evacuate a building in an emergency,when an emergency such as a fire flood or gas leak breaks out you need to be prepared to evacuate whether at school in the workplace or in any other public space it is important to have an established evacuation plan that you can follow closely in times of emergency create an evacuation plan and follow it in emergency situations to help you get out of a building quickly and as safely as possible plan your evacuation in advance taking note of the nearest exits for different groups when it comes time to evacuate do so sooner rather than later and always follow the instructions of the emergency response team,check evacuation plans office buildings hotels restaurants and other commercial spaces often have pre established evacuations plans and procedures check with building management to find out about the evacuation protocol if you are in this type of building 1 x research source look for evacuation maps on building doors and in public areas such as lobbies and stairwells if you are looking for evacuation plans for your office check with your manager or the company head regarding current evacuation plans and what roles different people are to fill during an emergency identify safe escape routes find routes that will get people out of the building with the least risk during an evacuation look at your building plans to help people find the exits nearest to them and create an evacuation plan that takes people to their nearest exit quickly and safely 2 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source try to avoid potential hazards such as going through kitchens or areas with large windows these pose an excess risk as lines in kitchens can break and exacerbate emergencies while windows may blow out and cause increased risk due to glass be sure to avoid mechanical transportation such as elevators as these could fail and put people at an increased risk use stairwells whenever possible mark your routes provide clear markers for people to guide people to exits from the building post evacuation maps throughout the building and mark exits with clear exit signs in spaces that do not get much natural light such as interior hallways you may also want to consider placing photoluminescent strips along the sides of the floors to help guide people to the nearest exit inform others make sure other people using the building know about the evacuation plan help them identify their nearest exit and tell them about safety precautions such as avoiding elevators it may also be helpful to appoint safety monitors to help guide others in the event of an evacuation if you are dealing with a large space that holds a great number of people assess the situation if possible find out why you are evacuating before you leave the building knowing why an evacuation has been called can help you modify your plan if necessary to best accommodate the circumstances 3 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source if for example there is a fire that blocks your nearest exit you know to go in the opposite direction of the fire even if another exit is further away if there is an active threat such as a bomb threat or an armed person spotted seek instructions from authorities such as the police or fire department before attempting to evacuate proceed quickly to an exit once you know you are to evacuate proceed quickly to your nearest exit do try to avoid panicking as panic can quickly disorganize a group slow down the evacuation process and put more people in danger 4 x research source do not worry about gathering belongings that are not immediately within reach taking time to pack a bag or go to another room once an evacuation has been called is dangerous take only what is already on your person or already packed and within arm s reach if possible exit through your nearest clearly marked exit sign if a standard exit truly is not accessible look for other ways out of the building such as through a window do not use the elevators elevators in evacuations are reserved for use by emergency personnel using elevators also puts your life at risk as the elevator may fall stop malfunction or otherwise fail to work if you have a disability that does not allow you to go down the stairs call 911 report your location and wait for emergency personnel at the designated area of rescue assistance depending on the building there may be evacuation chairs that can be deployed by wheelchair companions get some distance once you have exited the space make sure to put a safe distance between you and the building depending upon the situation authorities may have set up a do not cross line to indicate a safe distance consider whether there is a designated meeting place outlined in your evacuation plan if you are supposed to meet with others in a designated area proceed directly to that area think about how much space is necessary for different types of emergencies an emergency such as an electrical problem in the building likely requires less space than something like a fire consider how much space you need based on the reason for evacuation check in with responders once you are a safe distance away from the building check in with the authorities or emergency responders to let them know you re safe and see what your next steps need to be this is also the time to let someone know if you have been injured during evacuation 5 x research source if no authorities or first responders are present call the police or fire department as appropriate to warn them of potential threats and receive further instruction get clearance before you reenter the building make sure you get clearance from emergency responders that the building is safe and whatever threat caused the evacuation has been contained do not reenter a building that has not been inspected by the proper authorities 6 x research source if you were sent away after an evacuation call to check in with the building manager or local authorities to make sure the space is safe to re enter let them know we had to evacuate because of an emergency and we would like to know if it is safe to reenter the space additionally it may be helpful to ask are there any precautions we should take when going back into the space for the first time assess any damage if physical damage was done to the space take careful note of what damage occurred and what may be harmed or missing report any damage to the building manager or to the authorities and your insurance if you own the building 7 x research source in addition to noting damaged items note anything that seems lost or stolen take photographs or videos of the damage as well as thorough notes in case it is necessary for you to file an insurance claim update evacuation plans take this evacuation experience as an opportunity to work out kinks in your plan check with others if possible to see if there were obstacles or moments when the evacuation was slowed or stalled and update your plan accordingly if an evacuation was particularly slow look for alternative routes or consider dividing people up more evenly among exits recap with the evacuated group to address any problems that you saw and suggest improvements for the future,Home-and-Garden

signs that mines are close most mines are hidden but if you know what to look for you ll have a better chance of avoiding them don t let your guard down even for a moment if you are in a mined area constantly be on the lookout for the following signs trip wires these aren t usually clearly visible so you ve got to look closely at the ground wires are usually thin enough to be almost impossible to see signs of road repair this includes paved areas new fill road patches ditches and so on this could be a sign that mines were installed nearby signs or markers on trees stakes or posts the forces that place the mines may mark the minefields to protect their own soldiers 1 x trustworthy source united nations official site for the united nations an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations go to source dead animals 2 x research source cattle and other animals frequently detonate mines damaged vehicles abandoned cars trucks or other vehicles may have detonated a mine and more could be close by suspicious objects in trees and bushes not all mines are buried and not all uxo land on the ground disturbances in previous tire tracks or tracks that stop inexplicably wires leading away from the side of the road they may be firing wires that are partially buried odd features in the ground or patterns that are not present in nature 3 x research source plant growth may wilt or change color rain may wash away some of the cover the cover may sink or crack around the edges or the material covering the mines may look like mounds of dirt civilians staying away from certain places or out of certain buildings 4 x research source locals often know where mines or unexploded ordnance uxo are located question civilians to determine the exact locations stop immediately 5 x research source the moment you realize you may be in danger freeze do not take another step take some time to assess your situation and formulate an escape plan your movements from now on need to be slow careful and considered call out a warning to companions as soon as you think you are in danger make sure everyone knows so they can stop moving before someone detonates an explosive yell freeze and tell them to not to move their feet if you re the leader in this situation you ll have to coach them on how to leave the field safely make sure everyone s on the same page because one wrong move could get everyone killed do not pick anything up many mines are booby trapped 6 x research source you think you re picking up a helmet radio or military artifact and lo and behold there s a mine inside even toys and food are used as bait if you didn t drop it don t pick it up backtrack your way out of a mined area should you suspect that you have entered a minefield or mined area either because you see warning signs you see a mine or potential mine or because a detonation occurs remain calm and carefully back out of danger by stepping in your footsteps if possible do not turn around look behind you as you walk and slowly place your feet exactly where they were before continue until you are sure you are out of danger such as when you reach a road or other frequently traveled area probe the ground if you have to move forward for some reason or you can t see your tracks to backtrack you ll need to probe the ground for mines and move forward little by little probe the ground very carefully with your hands or feet you can also use a knife or another object to gently probe the area inch by inch probe at an angle rather than straight down since mines are usually detonated from top down pressure 7 x research source once you ve cleared a small area move forward and continue probing it s safest to move through the field very slowly and on your belly rather than walking through get help if you re in over your head if you re not absolutely sure where you stepped before and you don t feel comfortable probing don t risk moving inches can be the difference between life and death call for help or have people nearby do so 8 x research source if you are alone and can use a cell phone call for help do not use two way radios unless absolutely necessary the signal from the radio may cause certain types of mines or uxo to accidentally detonate 9 x research source if you have no way of reaching anyone wait do not try to make a run for it and do not attempt to probe your way out unless you know what you are doing pay attention for signs that a detonation may occur when exiting a minefield be alert for signs that a mine may detonate listen for unusual noises you may notice a faint click if a pressure plate has been depressed or a tilt rod has been moved or more likely you may hear the pop of the exploding cap pay attention to what you can feel as well if you are very alert and proceed slowly you may be able to feel the tension of a trip wire for example drop to the ground immediately if a detonation has been initiated 10 x research source soldiers call this hitting the deck if you notice any of the signs from the last step or if someone nearby cries out a warning that they have detonated a mine drop to the ground as quickly as possible you may have as little as a second before the mine explodes but if you use that second wisely you may be able to escape serious injury or death mines explode upward and it s safest close to the ground if possible fall backward in order to shield your upper body from shrapnel as much as possible while it s certainly possible to fall onto another mine the area right behind you is the safest place to fall because you were just walking there do not try to outrun the explosion projectiles will fly out from the mine at thousands of feet per second and the casualty radius the distance from the mine in which you can expect to be injured can be up to 100 feet or more mark the hazard and report its location to the proper authorities if you find a mine help make sure that other people avoid it by marking it 11 x research source use internationally recognized symbols or signs if possible or use the customary local warning make sure you are in safe territory before attempting to erect a warning note the location of the danger and report it to police the military or local de miners learn about land mines unexploded ordnance uxo is a term used to denote any kind of explosive weapons such as bombs grenades and artillery shells that have been used but have not yet exploded duds in other words and that retain the potential to detonate 12 x research source landmines are sometimes considered a type of uxo and while mines receive the most media attention all uxos are dangerous in some parts of the world uxo other than mines present the greatest hazard learn about the history of an area anytime that you are traveling to an unfamiliar area it s wise to learn about the history of that area to determine if there is a landmine risk areas that are experiencing armed conflict are clearly high risk but landmines and uxos remain dangerous long after the cessation of hostilities in vietnam cambodia and laos for example millions of mines and dud bombs remain and even in belgium long combat free crews have removed hundreds of tons of uxo left over from wwi and wwii in the past few years heed warning signs while you can t always count on minefields being marked you should definitely stay away from those that are internationally recognized symbols for minefields include a skull and crossbones and a red triangle signs are often but not always red and they frequently say mines or danger 13 x research source where signs are not present improvised warnings are often used such as painted rocks red usually indicates the boundary of the minefield and white indicates a safe path through it piles of stones flags in the ground tied grass or ribbons cordoning off an area many minefields have no warning signs so don t take the lack of a warning sign as an indication that the area is safe 14 x research source inquire locally mine warnings often don t last long over time plants weather animals and people dismantle or conceal signs in some areas metal signs are a valuable building material and it s not uncommon to see a mine warning used for example to patch a metal roof what s more in many places warnings are never installed local people however often know the general locations of mines and uxo so your best bet when traveling in potentially dangerous territory is to ask the locals whether an area is safe or better yet get a guide don t stray off established paths except in active combat situations if people regularly use a path you can be sure it is not mined just off the path however danger may be lurking,Home-and-Garden
how to build a fallout shelter,a fallout shelter protects you and your family after a nuclear attack or disaster you can begin building a simple shelter by digging a trench and covering it with roofing logs and dirt this type of shelter called a pole covered trench shelter is waterproof and radiation resistant when constructed properly though you hopefully will never have to use the shelter you can rest easy knowing you are prepared for anything,choose a building area on stable ground away from obstructions when a nuclear weapon detonates it creates a thermal pulse which can set things 20 mi 32 km away on fire you can often build a shelter in your backyard if you can position it so that both rainwater and water behind dams runs away from it you will also need to consider where the utility lines are in your area so you don t disturb them 1 x research source try to select stable ground where trees and buildings won t fall on your shelter if you re in a city you can build a reinforced shelter in a basement the concrete can protect you from fallout and falling debris research the topography of your area your government s local land survey office will have them available also check with the emergency response office avoid positioning your shelter downhill from bodies of water or below steep slopes keep it clear of flammable buildings print out a blueprint for the shelter you want to make having a clear blueprint will help you construct a stable effective shelter you can find some basic plans simply by searching for fallout shelter blueprints online some plans may even include a step by step overview for building the shelter 2 x research source you can also get blueprints by consulting an architect or drafter they can provide guidance on what shelter best suits your needs most building construction companies can build a shelter for you even if you don t want to hire someone to design a shelter sketch your own plans before beginning construction you can try using a computer program like sketchup stake out and clear the building area for construction plot out the shelter s perimeter according to your blueprint plant a series of wooden stakes in the ground to outline the shelter s perimeter then use shovels axes and other tools to dig up grass trees rocks and other debris in the area 3 x research source clear the land about 10 ft 3 0 m beyond the shelter s perimeter so you have plenty of space to work with the shelter s size is up to you expect to add about 3 ft 0 91 m to the shelter s length for every person who will hide there a basic 4 person shelter is about 10 10 10 ft 3 0 3 0 3 0 m in size dig a trench and move the dirt out of the excavation area begin digging out soil to form the basic outline of your shelter you can do this with shovels although it takes a lot of time and labor move the excavated dirt 10 ft 3 0 m beyond the stakes you will need to keep the dirt away so it doesn t fall back into the trench 4 x research source for quicker work rent a backhoe from an equipment company near you this can get pricey but speeding up the excavation process is often worth it digging a deeper trench means more space and blast protection for your shelter create an emergency exit at the far end of the trench the emergency exit will also serve as extra ventilation at the end of the trench dig a crawl space about 2 ft 0 61 m wide and 3 1 2 ft 1 1 m deep the crawl space will be right below the soil s surface create an exit at the end by digging a small trench to connect the crawl space to the outside world 5 x research source you can build dirt steps as needed to reach the surface pile dirt near the entryway then begin digging into it with a shovel shape the dirt into small steps lay threshold boards over each steps connecting them to side boards with 10 in 25 cm lag bolts always have a second exit in your shelter to guard against emergencies make a second crawl way for the entrance create the main entryway the same way you built the emergency exit this time dig on the opposite end of the shelter you can make this entryway a little wider so you have an easier time entering the shelter keep the entryway below ground emerging away from the shelter s main living quarters 6 x research source the main entrance will not have air pumps or ventilation pipes running through it so it may appear larger by default lay wooden roofing poles side by side over the trench get poles that overhang the trench by at least 2 ft 0 61 m so they are less likely to collapse lay them across the trench s width push the logs as close together as possible to reduce the gaps in the shelter s roof 7 x research source for example try using 9 ft 2 7 m poles over a trench 5 ft 1 5 m wide roofing poles are basically long uncut pieces of timber you can get them from lumber yards roofing suppliers and home improvement stores may also be able to help stack poles in front of the entryways to keep dirt out of them lay a few 6 ft 1 8 m wooden roofing poles between the trench and the edge of each entryway use about 3 or 4 logs on each side tie them together with strong rope or wire also binding them to the closest poles hanging over the trench 8 x research source these entryway poles hold back the dirt you will use to create the shelter ceiling if you don t have them in place the dirt can slide into the entryways blocking them waterproof the logs with a tarp or another plastic material make sure you cover any gaps between the logs so water and dirt can t fall into the shelter you can do this easily by purchasing a tarp large enough to fit over the trench also try overlapping a few smaller tarps 9 x research source you can also fill the gaps with cloth leaves clay or other alternative materials cover the logs with an 18 in 46 cm earth dome begin moving the excavated dirt back on top of the logs make sure the dirt is unable to leak into the living space below the logs as you pile up the dirt shape it into a rounded mound ending right before the shelter s entrances the mound shape will give your shelter s roof plenty of stability to prevent it from caving in 10 x research source for extra radiation protection make the dome deeper try placing a second plastic tarp layer over the dome then pile up another 18 in 46 cm of dirt pack the earth around the entryways to seal out water stack a few shorter roofing poles or sandbags around each entrance tie them down tightly with rope or wire then build up the earth around the poles into slopes 6 in 15 cm deep to drive water away from the entryways 11 x research source make the slopes on all sides of each entryway to ensure that rainwater never enters the shelter hang plastic canopies over the entryways to protect them from water extend a plastic tarp from the roof dome over the entryway sink a few stakes in the dome then tie the tarp in place with strong cords or wires secure the other end of the tarp to the logs or sandbags stacked in front of the entryway to further waterproof your shelter 12 x research source make sure the tarps form a tent shape they need to form a consistent slope so water rolls away from your shelter install a hand operated ventilation pump in the emergency exit choose a ventilation pump with a pipe about 20 in 51 cm wide and 36 in 91 cm tall place the filter on the floor next to the emergency exit then run the pipe along the crawl space letting it emerge preferably above the plastic canopy 13 x research source always use a pump with an option for manual operation the pump will run on its own most of the time but in case of an emergency you can operate it to keep the shelter s air clean set up a toilet in a separate area of the shelter you have several options for installing toilets the most efficient way is a composting toilet similar to what you would see in an rv you will need to install a ventilation pipe running it from the toilet to the surface a good location for the toilet is near the exit furthest from your sleeping quarters 14 x research source to install the ventilation pipe run it through the nearest entryway if possible you may need to dig through the dirt so the pipe exits above the plastic canopy over the entryway you can also try joining the pipe to the air pump s ventilation pipe many shelters do not feature running water so a regular toilet isn t usually an option you may not be able to get clean running water in an emergency so you may need to install an expensive system of tanks pipes and filters if you want more comfort another option is to use small plastic toilets or buckets it isn t ideal but it is an effective way to keep your shelter safe and sanitary seal the buckets and carry them to the surface as needed make beds and other furniture for the shelter with a pole covered trench shelter the best way to set up furniture is to make hammocks loop strong rope or wire around the ceiling poles connect the rope or wire to cloth to create strong but lightweight hammocks you can also try assembling poles and boards together to create bunk beds 15 x research source you do not have to buy bulky furniture get creative and craft your own furniture or assemble makeshift bedding for example you can make a bed by piling blankets even packing together leaves pine needle or hay is a fast inexpensive way to create a bed pack food water and other necessities food and water are the most important supplies so keep them in abundance plan on having at least 1 us gal 3 8 l of water per person per day keep a supply of dry food that will last you about 2 weeks also bring along medical supplies disposal bins and extra clothing 16 x research source you will generally need to be in the shelter for around 3 days but plan on staying up to a month in case of a serious emergency get a good first aid kit that includes bandages tape splints scissors rubbing alcohol and any medication you need for food bring things that don t require a lot of preparation such as lentils jerky and military mres find a room made out of concrete the best shelter rooms are underground although you can convert any concrete room into a shelter a basement is often a great place for a shelter also look for concrete office buildings or other protected structures unlikely to collapse during an event 17 x research source if you have to make an indoors shelter try to choose a room closer to the middle of the building this will put as much space between you and the fallout as possible you can also build a separate concrete room or shelter outside shield the walls with heavy materials like sandbags if you have time stack sandbags near windows and other spots where radiation can leak in the more you cover the walls the more protection you have against radiation makeshift materials like mattresses tables books and even bags of clothes help during an emergency 18 x research source stock the shelter with food and other necessities plan on keeping enough supplies for at least 3 days fill it with clean bottled water and snacks that don t require much preparation be sure to include medical supplies and prescription medication you will also need a sanitation bucket 19 x research source a radio is handy and you can use it to listen to updates it may help you decide when leaving the shelter is safe leave small vents for air at the entrances seal up the entrances with sandbags or other resistant material leave a small gap so that everyone in the shelter has enough air to breathe 20 x research source also consider installing an air ventilation pump you may be able to connect it to ventilation pipes already installed in the building,Home-and-Garden
how to survive being stuck in a lift,being stuck in a lift also known as an elevator can sometimes be scary especially if you are a fan of those kinds of movies which have a lot of elevator tragedies even though being stuck in an elevator in real life is not like in the movies it is still a vital thing to know how to survive if it ever happens to you,remain calm and do not panic you may have heard this a lot of times and it is true that panicking will do you no good it will cause you to not be able to think clearly and will not make your situation better remain calm and remember that this is reality and not a film and a modern lift is not likely to come crashing down even if the cables snap 1 x research source if it is dark find a light source modern phones can usually be used to for this purpose 2 x research source don t escape through the hatches in the ceiling luckily modern lifts don t have hatches in the ceiling escaping this way would be extremely dangerous close out any negative thoughts and think positive remember that you are still alive and don t believe it when your mind tells you that the walls are closing in they are not closing in they will not close in and you can still breathe just keep it in mind that elevators usually have cameras so don t do anything which looks stupid and you will regret imagine what people would think when they view the tape 3 x research source press each of the floor buttons one by one then try the doors open button if none of the buttons works the lift is broken and you need to let someone know about it 4 x research source look through the gap between the doors of the lift 5 x research source if you can see light between the doors the lift has stopped near a floor and you should be able to shout for help and be released as the doors can be opened with a key do not try to force the doors open yourself if the lift starts working again when you are partway out you could be in for a nasty surprise if you can t see light between the doors the lift has stopped between floors and no one will be able to let you out if you scream for help look for an emergency telephone if there is no telephone there should be an alarm button press this repeatedly eventually someone should hear you and get help if it seems like no one can hear you don t give up hope keep pressing the button and know that you will be rescued check the time if you have waited for more than half an hour and nobody has come to get you out shout and bang the inside walls of the lift take off your shoe and bang with that if there are still people in the building you must get their help before they leave for the night if everyone has left the building and no one is responding to you then you ll have to accept that you will be in the lift overnight if this happens stop shouting and banging you don t want to develop sleep deprivation you are probably tired by now make yourself as comfortable as possible and get some sleep to save your energy by morning the building should be full again and you can try to get some help then call for help using either an emergency or alarm button located on the elevator s button panel or an emergency phone which should be built into the elevator usually concealed behind a door under the button panel it is law in most countries for elevators to have an emergency phone if none of these options are available try the next step before the building shuts down see if your phone has any reception or internet if you do have reception call emergency services explain your situation and ask for help tell them the address of the building you are in and between which floors you are stuck if you have wifi connection contact a family member or friend you can go on facebook and ask a friend that you know will believe you tell them that you are in an elevator that has stopped working and ask them to contact emergency services and explain your situation to the police or fire department don t forget to tell them what the address is of the building and possibly which elevator you are stuck in now just wait patiently,Home-and-Garden
how to get your keys out of an elevator shaft,so you ve dropped your keys down the narrow crack where the doors open in an elevator congratulations this is not your day you have three options one of which is to get it out yourself see below warning never attempt to retrieve lost items from the pit of an elevator shaft unless you have the proper tools and training is whatever you lost worth losing a limb or your life,call the maintenance person ask if they have a drop key sometimes they have one of these and can be persuaded to retrieve your keys it depends on the building 1 x research source get the key back from them call a technician every building should have the name of the technician either in the office or in the elevator itself the technician get the keys they will stop the elevators and then open up the space beneath the elevators then they will grab your keys for you pay them in the usa it is about 75 to 300 2 x research source consider if you can wait if you are not in a rush you can wait till their next scheduled service usually a few times a year they would normally not charge you for that go to a hardware store and buy a 50 lb 20 kilogram magnet that means a magnet that can pull 50 pounds the magnet doesn t weigh that much they are very small and inexpensive 2 to 3 dollars buy thin but strong rope to tie to the magnet also buy a telescoping magnet they are about the width of a pen and extend to about 2 feet 0 6 m you will also need 1 or 2 bright flashlights a yardstick or broom handle and scissors stop the elevator on the lowest floor the elevator should have either a stop button or have someone in your building use the key to keep the elevator on the bottom floor and the doors open if there is another elevator next to your elevator stop that elevator on the bottom floor as well spot the keys set up your flashlight and find your keys by laying on the ground and shining the flashlight through the crack they should be no more than a few feet away if possible use another flashlight and also locate your keys from the elevator next door this is possible only if the elevators are relatively close no more than 8 feet most likely by angling your flashlight so you are able to see the floor of the elevator shaft and your keys 3 x research source dangle the magnet tie the 50 lb magnet tightly to a long piece of string you need to get the magnet beneath the elevator dangling on the string this is difficult because the magnet will stick to the metal side of the elevator and the shaft you can wrap the string around the magnet a bunch of times stick your arm out the side of the elevator yes into the shaft and yes it is scary and throw the magnet don t forget to hold the string the string should unwind and leave your magnet on the floor if dangling doesn t work use a long stick take the magnet and shove it down the shaft along the walls to which it is sticking with a yardstick or other long narrow object remember the idea is that it should dangle lower the magnet until it touches your keys this should be relatively easy unless your keys have bounced a bit and you can t see them then you will need someone at the elevator next to yours to guide you in the swinging of your magnet once your keyring sticks to the magnet pull it up slowly know the key can get stuck sometimes even once you have your keys it becomes impossible to get them up through the crack because your magnet gets stuck to the bottom or sides of the elevator and your keys fall of when you yank the magnet at this point it is necessary to use the telescoping magnet tie the string to the telescoping magnet and lower it through crack like a clock hand because the magnet is small and not as strong it should easily pop off the side and dangle repeat step six,Home-and-Garden
how to dig a bunker,a hidden underground bunker requires much planning and hard work but offers peace of mind that you will have somewhere to protect your family if or indeed when civilization as we know it implodes,check the legal and zoning requirements this is the step where we tell you to make sure you are legally allowed to dig your bunker if you excavate illegally and someone finds out you will face a fine and have to fill it in or your council will fill it in and charge you for the privilege 1 x research source plan and research every aspect in great detail the below stages are listed in order that they occur but each stage needs to be considered before the project is started 2 x research source think carefully before committing to a bunker under your home digging a bunker under a home has advantages and disadvantages advantages include that the entrance to the bunker can be concealed and it is easier to supply electricity etc 3 x research source disadvantages are many messing

pose a threat if bears are a concern be sure to store your food away from your sleeping area if snakes are a concern be extra careful about watching where you step bring the proper supplies including food and water appropriate clothing water purification tablets a knife and or hatchet a fire starter a first aid kit a map of the area and a compass if you plan on being out in the wilderness consider

elements and preventing illness and injury make a shelter appropriate for your location try to keep the climate in mind when choosing the materials to use if the area is very hot you will want to make

bone you may have to create a splint using sticks and a piece of fabric always use antiseptic ointment for open wounds if you have it 12 x research source try to make contact use whatever means you can think of to let other people know where you are and that you need help 13 x research source if you have a cell phone but do not have good enough reception to make a phone call try sending a text instead use an emergency radio or flares if you have them use clothing or other items to spell out a message that can be read from above such as sos reflect the sun using a mirror or other shiny object to increase your visibility build a signal fire try to burn materials that create a lot of smoke like evergreen boughs in the daytime to keep your signal visible the universal signal for help is three columns of smoke if you re lost stay put so someone can find you if you attempt to find your way out on your own you may just get lost further in the wilderness,Home-and-Garden
how to survive an emp,emp stands for electromagnetic pulse which is a strong burst of electromagnetic energy that causes electronic devices to suddenly stop functioning there are four potential sources of an emp lightning the sun a nuclear blast and a weaponized emp while the process for surviving a nuclear blast or a lightning storm is a little different the general process is the same regardless of the source of the emp keep in mind the best thing you can do to survive an emp is to prepare ahead of time by developing a disaster plan and stockpiling emergency food and water,turn your radio on immediately to get as much information as possible most electronics are going to stop functioning as soon as the emp goes off however depending on the type of emp there is a good chance that radios will continue to work at least for a short while turn the radio on and tune in to any news source with a decent signal keep it on as long as possible and pay attention while you take the next steps to ensure that you get as much information as you can 1 x research source most emps emit gamma rays that overload tiny circuits in modern electronics computers phones and electrical grids will likely go out but rudimentary electronics that rely on radio waves are unlikely to be affected 2 x research source try not to panic an emp may be catastrophic to the electrical systems in the area but the electromagnetic signal itself will not harm you there is a very good chance everything will be fine 3 x research source this will likely only work if you have a battery operated radio shelter in place and wait for the initial chaos to subside if all of the electronics suddenly stop working the immediate loss of electricity will cause a lot of sudden confusion and chaos if you aren t home wait 30 45 minutes for all of the abrupt danger to pass then go home if you re within a few miles or kilometers if you re already home stay there and do not go outside 4 x research source if the radio mentions a nuclear blast stay where you are do not leave under any condition and get as low as you can in the building you re in go to the basement lowest level or a room underground the air is thinner the higher up you are and the nuclear gamma rays will impact you more easily if you re up high 5 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source if you have a family your first thought is likely how to find them and keep them safe if your family has no emergency plan in place nobody can fault you for making a break for your child s school or your partner s workplace once you have everyone go home take backroads and don t drive if you do have to go out if you are going out to retrieve family or you weren t home when the emp occurred stay out of your vehicle if you have less than 3 4 miles 4 8 6 4 km to travel walk side streets and back roads to stay out of harm s way and avoid the chaos busy streets will likely be pretty disorderly in the hours following an emp 6 x research source if you re outside during a nuclear blast cover your mouth and nose with a cloth or mask to avoid breathing in toxic particles 7 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source a bicycle is a great way to get around if you can t take your vehicle out your vehicle may still work if it s older or it doesn t rely on a dedicated electrical signal outside of the battery to keep the engine going which is the case for many vehicles 8 x research source you can drive it if you absolutely have to but it s safer to stay off of the roads if you can 9 x research source fill your bathtub and empty bottles with water in case the pressure goes out many municipal water systems rely on electronics while the water may work now it may go out within a few hours as the pressure empties out put a stopper in your tub and fill it up with water to create a reserve then fill every pitcher bottle bucket and glass with water this way you won t need to worry about dehydration for at least a few weeks 10 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source cover any open glasses or pitchers with flat objects to keep contaminants out of you water and keep the water out of direct sunlight as best as you can eat anything in your fridge first to minimize food shortages for the first 1 2 days eat whatever is in your fridge and hasn t gone bad immediately save the dry stuff for later when you may really need it the odds are low society will completely collapse and you ll go without help for super long but it s still better to go through everything that s going to go bad anyway 11 x research source anything in your fridge will be perfectly safe for 40 minutes after the power goes out after that things start to go bad don t eat any food that develops a slimy texture mold an odor or any discoloration after 2 4 hours 12 x trustworthy source foodsafety gov online portal combining food safety information from the u s food and drug administration the food safety and inspection service and the centers for disease control and prevention go to source if it s cold outside and you can keep your food cool outdoors pack everything into a cooler and set it outside pack your frozen goods in a cooler with ice and eat them as they thaw dump everything worth saving in your freezer into a large cooler pour in the ice from your ice trays or ice maker and set the cooler in the coldest location possible once everything in your fridge has gone bad start eating things that have thawed from your freezer work your way from the most thawed to the least thawed 13 x research source you can store frozen goods outside in a cooler packed with ice if it s cold out don t eat anything that has completely thawed and may have started to go bad especially if it s uncooked meat develop an disaster plan for you and your family grab a notebook pen and sit down with your family select a safe location near your home for everyone to meet up in the event that something bad happens agree on a safe location for a hidden key such as a rock or plant outside determine where you will put household pets while you wait for one another and whether the first person to arrive should seek help or not jot down the key elements of your plan and make a copy for everyone in your family 14 x research source for example you may have everyone meet inside a shed in your backyard assign the first family member that shows up to lock the room with your food in it and wait for everyone to show up before going inside together a large part of a disaster plan involves stockpiling food tools and other necessities however assigning responsibilities setting a meeting location and coming up with an immediate plan involves a group discussion if you live with others purchase walkie talkies and battery operated radios to stay connected in the event of an emp short range walkie talkies and battery operated radios are highly likely to continue working pick up a set of walkie talkies for everyone in your family and get 2 battery operated radios to stay connected with the news immediately following an emergency 15 x research source anything that plugs into a wall won t work you must use battery operated or hand cranked radios get 2 radios that are different brands in the event that the emp fries one of them don t forget to stock up on batteries for the radios and walkie talkies invest in a faraday cage to protect emergency electronics a faraday cage is a box that will block external gamma rays and emp waves it s a perfect way to store an emergency cell phone radio and other electronic goods you can either buy a faraday cage or make your own by lining a stainless steel trash can with aluminum foil and closing it with an airtight lid 16 x research source there are faraday bags you can buy that will protect electronics on the go stock a shelter with non perishable food and survival tools put a locked door on a basement underground room or large room with plenty of closet space purchase enough canned and non perishable food to last you at least 3 months unlike a nuclear strike or some other catastrophic disaster an emp disaster is unlikely to last more than 3 months but it s better to be safe than sorry place your food in the designated shelter 17 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source an average adult needs 110 fluid ounces 3 3 l of water a day and roughly 2 400 calories a day add the total amount you need for your family to last 1 day then multiply it by 90 to determine how much food and water you need the more food you can buy the better ideally you will stock up on a year s worth of food store your other emergency gear in the shelter get an analog thermometer and clock stockpile some medicine a hand cranked flashlight a manual can opener and extra sets of clothes you ll also need a first aid kit batteries water purifying tablets maps cleaning supplies and toolbox don t forget sanitary items like toilet paper feminine supplies and soap 18 x research source if you have extra space dedicate it to extra food and water you can never have enough in an emergency switch over to solar power to keep the power on during an emp hire a contractor to come out and install solar panels on the roof of your home have your entire home rewired to operate on a closed circuit this way if an emp hits you will still be able to power your home this is an expensive cost up front a closed solar system can run 10 000 25 000 but it ll pay for itself in the long run and you ll have power during a disaster 19 x research source create some stockpiles in hidden nearby locations if you can if you aren t home or end up having to flee your home set up 3 5 small stockpiles in areas you ll be able to find pack a 1 to 2 day supply of food an extra flashlight and a set of tools bury a bag in your yard keep one in your vehicle s trunk and set another in a location you have access to but others don t 20 x research source get some self defense equipment but don t get hasty in an emergency it doesn t hurt to have a weapon in an extreme situation however don t automatically jump to grab a gun or bladed weapon the moment someone approaches your door or talks to you during an emergency if you get a gun keep it in a locked gun safe keep it unloaded and get the proper licenses and registration depending on your federal and local laws 21 x research source you don t have to have a gun a baseball bat knife or pepper spray will also serve your purposes during an emergency only use your weapon if you re actively being attacked and your life is in danger a gun or handheld weapon is always the last resort,Home-and-Garden

how to scream as loud as you can if in danger,scream is usually the first thing people tell you when they re dispensing advice about what to do when threatened attacked or otherwise in danger but that s just a bit more complicated than it seems you may need a little help to make a racket loud enough to save yourself,when you breathe in try to breathe from your stomach not your chest this requires practice put your hand on your stomach and breathe out feeling your abdominal muscles contract when you breathe in they should expand it should feel like sipping through a straw imagine drawing air from the bottom of your lungs not the top do this a few times until it feels comfortable and you can do it without pressing a hand to your stomach a practice scream should feel like something namely your stomach muscles is pushing it out of you by contracting around your lungs it should not hurt scream in a higher pitch higher notes are generally more audible they cause longer soundwaves which hit people s ears that much harder even if you re male let loose like a little girl don t try too hard mind you forcing your voice into a high note that is incongruous with your usual tone or higher than natural for your voice can cause minor injury also screaming higher and if it so happens shrilly usually indicates fear more than a macho war cry you re trying to say help me not i m bad news try to avoid tipping your head back to do so you may assume that a higher note means i should hold my chin higher but tilting your head backward can actually put excess strain on your vocal chords and make it harder to produce sound so don t do it optimum volume is achieved when you hit the perfect note frequency and force of exhalation this is the level at which glass shatters and dogs howl if you can t get this amplitude don t sweat it usually only professionals can if you get anywhere close count it as a success in the best case scenario you ll be loud enough to temporarily deafen your assailant don t count on it do not utilize this next tip as a first choice you should try to stay as far away from your attacker as possible but if you re forced anywhere close to him or her put your mouth as close to their ear as you can to scream it s generally painful on their end of things don t be afraid to keep it up even if your throat rips don t stop that scream saving your neck is more important than sparing your windpipe if you have to stop because you re hit or run out of air drag in another breath and scream again try to avoid gasping even if it seems to waste time taking a deep breath only takes about a second two if you really draw in and a longer louder scream is more effective than one that is short lived and oxygen deprived do not stop screaming this cannot be emphasized enough no matter what does or does not happen is or is not inflicted upon you keep screaming until help arrives even if you manage to incapacitate your attacker keep screaming smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb f f2 671123 7 bullet 1 jpg v4 460px 671123 7 bullet 1 jpg bigurl images thumb f f2 671123 7 bullet 1 jpg aid671123 v4 300px 671123 7 bullet 1 jpg smallwidth 460 smallheight 307 bigwidth 300 bigheight 200 licensing div class mw parser output p image by uploader br nlicense a rel nofollow class external text href https creativecommons org licenses by 3 0 creative commons a n p div of course if and when help arrives preferably law enforcement you can stop the pipework and breathe if you continue to scream mostly likely they will assume hysteria has set in or at the very least become irritated smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 7 72 671123 7 bullet 2 jpg v4 460px 671123 7 bullet 2 jpg bigurl images thumb 7 72 671123 7 bullet 2 jpg aid671123 v4 300px 671123 7 bullet 2 jpg smallwidth 460 smallheight 307 bigwidth 300 bigheight 200 licensing div class mw parser output p image by uploader br nlicense a rel nofollow class external text href https creativecommons org licenses by 3 0 creative commons a n p div if you are able to escape run away screaming while calling your country s emergency number like 911 on your phone scream into that police will respond even if it s wordless if you don t have a phone yell loudly at passerby to call the police the person behind you is an assailant and that it s real not a joke though you may feel inclined to breath in through your nose do not do that your nose is the most direct passage to the lungs but don t let that fool you breath in through your mouth as you let more air in that way when time matters you want to get the most air in in the shortest time,Home-and-Garden
how to make a power outage bearable,power outages are more than just sitting in the dark the refrigerator stops running and everything starts to defrost if you live in the tropical climate the air conditioning is the first to shut off and so are the ceiling fans out come the flashlights and portable fans and you just sit quietly waiting for the power to return most power outages caused by accidents that compromise power lines are usually repaired in a day or two in the case of winter storms power outages can last for weeks,consider the type of emergencies your particular home is most likely to face a blizzard prone area will be different from one in a tropical area that commonly faces hurricanes urban areas face different challenges than rural areas cook perishable foods if the temperature rises take anything out of the refrigerator that might spoil and prepare to cook it or consume it before it warms up eat perishables before spoilage can occur 1 x research source have stable foods that don t require refrigeration those that do not require cooking are even better 2 x research source canned meats fish soups vegetables and juices will work and can be kept for months at a time crackers cookies and snacks for the kiddies are a necessity eat these items after the perishables are eaten or are unsafe to eat to make perishables last longer avoid opening the fridge unless absolutely necessary the air in the fridge will remain cold for a limited amount of time even after the power goes out but the more you expose it to room temperature the faster it will warm up and the faster your food will spoil you can also minimize heat gain by packing everything in the fridge tightly together have a back up method of heating food and water a camping stove is ideal and be sure to know how to use it safely see warnings a barbecue grill will work quite well but do not bring it into the house you don t want carbon monoxide poisoning a gas stove can often work if you have matches for ignition remember to have plenty of fuel on hand for your camp stove or barbecue in case your adventure lasts several days 3 x research source water is actually more important than food and if your water supply is pump driven it may give out in a power failure put aside many gallons or liters of drinking water fill your bathtub or pails with water for flushing the toilet washing and so on 4 x research source read the article titled how to get emergency drinking water from a water heater have a back up method for heating or cooling your home during a blackout depending on your climate s needs do you need to stock up on wood for the wood stove you should consider buying portable fans and cold water rinses to stay cool if your home runs on natural gas or propane install a gas fired fireplace that has its own thermopile electronic ignition should you get a gas powered generator 5 x research source prepare by equipping your house with automatic power failure safety lighting so that it does not go dark when the power goes out many of the commercial style emergency lights look pretty bad on the wall of your kitchen or living room and they typically only last 90 minutes day or night 6 x research source try to find power failure safety lights that sense darkness before going on otherwise the batteries will be dead before darkness comes new power failure safety lights just hitting the market deliver light for long periods of time because of the improvements in led brightness and battery life look for power failure safety lights on the web and find ones that you can install in any room of your home without being an eyesore start with the kitchen and bathrooms the two most used rooms of the house power outages can mean get out of the house during the day if it is safe to do so go to the mall or take in a movie have a few good meals at a nearby diner or at a fast food restaurant unless you are snowbound or ill there is no reason to stay indoors and be uncomfortable there s plenty of time for that when it gets too late to stay out if you can afford it get a powerful portable power outlet like atom or a portable power generator a few basic necessities can be plugged into these think lights fans laptops cell phones and radios don t expect to power your whole home off of one of these some portable power generators can even power your refrigerator 7 x research source remember that there will be no tv no light and games that need reading will not be able to be played turn on your flashlight only when you need to move about you can make up your own games sing songs or practice the ancient art of talking with one another be playful if possible read a book to pass the time remember this can only be done during the daylight hours at night the best thing is to go to sleep time passes faster when you sleep especially when there is nothing else to do but wait keep a battery powered camping lantern available these will light a room better than a flashlight 8 x research source also keep a manual can opener handy to open animal food cans as well as other preserves keep a battery powered radio available to monitor local news and emergency developments 9 x research source cell phones will also lose their charge quickly so having a battery powered cell phone charger is also a good idea,Home-and-Garden
how to avoid danger during civil unrest,civil unrest or civil disorder is a breakdown of normal society that leads to riots violence or other sorts of disorder and is often ultimately suppressed by armed government officials 1 x research source civil unrest can happen anywhere as recent riots in places as varied as dubai ferguson paris and san bernardino suggest all that is required is enough people and can happen for a variety of reasons such as political unrest weather fire and socio economic instability there are techniques to avoid danger should you find yourself in the midst of a civil unrest at home or abroad as well techniques to wait out the unrest and stay safe in the aftermath,stay home most experts agree that the safest place to be during a civil unrest incident is in your home staying home keeps you out of the chaos and also allows you to defend your location if you need to don t go back out to find out what s going on and don t delay getting home if you re out 2 x research source you can and should prepare for emergencies such as civil unrest bad weather or any other mass incident staying home will allow you to effectively utilize your resources while keeping you safer from danger 3 x research source create a safe room a safe room is a specially designed room in your home that meets federal emergency management agency fema standards and is virtually impenetrable to external problems such as weather incidents fire or looters 4 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source fema s guidelines primarily ensure that your safe room is weatherproof you can however fortify your room for additional standards such as fireproofing or bulletproofing fortify your house many experts agree that you should also fortify your home whether you choose to install a safe room or not fortifying your home means that you strengthen its barriers just in case the unrest incident spills over to your location 5 x research source invest in a security system that includes outside cameras this will offer you an additional line of defense a popular basic fortification is replacing standard windows with impact resistant glass stay informed one benefit of our digital age is that we can stay connected pretty easily and have 24 hour access to the news make it a point to read up on or listen to what is happening globally nationally and locally staying informed about current events and any situations that may potentially devolve into civil unrest gives you more time to ensure that you and your family s safety 6 x research source many news organizations have applications for smart phones that will send you alerts if big news is breaking in your area make sure that you don t just rely on the internet for your information if a civil unrest situation persists you may lose internet and cell access consider purchasing a battery operated or hand crank operated radio to stay informed if you lose electricity a police scanner will allow you hear police radio traffic which will alert you to any situations long before they are broadcast by the media stockpile resources whether the civil disturbance is brief lasts for days or even weeks you ll need access to basic necessities this especially important because you won t be able to go out and replenish your supplies plan ahead think about what your family needs not wants and stockpile appropriately make sure that you have enough water for every member of your family the average adult drinks one half gallon per day and children sick people and pregnant women drink more than that it s safest to store pre packaged water and don t forget to account for your pets too 7 x research source store enough food for your family to survive several days and remember to consider dietary restrictions such as celiac disease or allergies opt for foods with the most nutrition and longest shelf life such as canned vegetables stew and powdered milk some foods may even be stored indefinitely 8 x research source keep a 30 day supply of medications on hand if you can and keep them together so that you can easily stick them in your emergency kit if you need to it s also a good idea to make a list of all medications your family takes and the dosages make sure that you have a fully functional first aid kit in your supplies have emergency cash on hand in small bills 9 x research source form a network having a group of people that you can trust prepare with and share resources with is invaluable should the unrest remain uncontrolled your group will rely on one another for survival as you won t have access to supermarkets or drugstores 10 x research source locate a place to meet work with your network family and friends to decide where you ll all meet should civil unrest persist remember cell service will likely not be good in the area so make sure that you all know exactly where to meet how to find one another and when you ll go to that location 11 x research source for example you might decide that if a state of emergency is declared your group will meet at the predetermined location within an hour of the announcement or you may decide that if roads become blocked you ll meet up so that you can evacuate safely practice your plan don t wait until there is a civil unrest incident to find out if your plan to avoid danger and stay safe is effective or not practice your plan with your family and your network so that you can work out any kinks and modify your plan as needed there are emergency plans available on the internet for download that can serve as a good template from which you can develop your own plan 12 x research source secure your home if rioting is imminent secure your home and business rioting often brings looting and looters can pillage and destroy your property make sure your doors are locked and board up all your windows remove small valuables to a safer place if possible since determined rioters will get in just about anywhere check your locks and windows first floor windows are more vulnerable than others and doors without deadbolts are less secure it s possible that civil unrest incidents can spill over to other areas such as your house and you need to ensure that you have adequate locks on all of your doors and windows 13 x research source know the law it is important to know local laws governing self defense no matter how you plan to defend yourself and your home you don t want to find yourself in trouble after the unrest has been controlled because you violated the law this is equally important if you are in another city state or country you ll want to learn federal state county and city laws that apply to your address register your trip let your embassy or consulate know your trip details so that they can keep you informed if any civil unrest situations occur often they can help you evacuate should it be necessary and assist you with resources also they can help you get in contact with your family back home so that you can let them know you re okay 14 x research source every embassy or consulate has a website or phone number that you can easily locate on the internet when you contact the embassy or consulate ask if there is any additional information or precautions that you should be made aware of have a plan you likely won t know the area very well if you re travelling abroad take some time to learn the layout of the streets official evacuation routes the embassy location atm locations hospital locations and any other relevant potential sources of assistance 15 x research source you can typically get maps of travel destinations from your travel agent from a bookstore and online so that you can learn the area before you even begin your trip many hotels and local governments offer free maps of the area for travelers this is a great resource that shows you the layout of the city and because they re geared toward travelers also show landmarks which can be helpful to know in times of civil unrest know security protocols often local governments will have security protocols for civil unrest incidents that apply to locals as well as travelers learn these security protocols so that you don t put yourself in extra danger and are able to take advantage of any protections the government might offer 16 x research source get travel insurance you might think that travel insurance is just for missed flights or medical emergencies that happen while you re on your trip and while most travel insurance has a specific exclusion for civil unrest there are policies that you can purchase that will cover this event if you think that you re going to an area where unrest is more likely it is worth the extra work to insure your trip 17 x research source avoid public transportation because streets may be gridlocked crowded and potentially violent avoid public transportation especially bus and train stations these places may become hopelessly and dangerously crowded if there is even a threat of impending civil unrest airports can also become swamped potentially dangerous places so it s best to call the airport or your embassy in advance to check on the situation there don t fuel the fire survival experts agree that if you do need to leave your home do so quietly don t attract attention to yourself keep your head down be quiet and don t get involved in the unrest you don t want to put yourself in unnecessary danger or delay your evacuation 18 x research source know the official evacuation routes if you live in a weather incident prone area your local government may have pre established evacuation routes these may be a good option for you but more than likely they will be at a standstill with everyone trying to leave en masse it s a good idea to ask if the state or county has any secondary evacuation routes mapped out and to keep those in mind as well 19 x research source seek assistance whether the civil unrest incident was brief or lasted for weeks your life will be disrupted to some degree after the situation is controlled relief organizations may come into the area to offer food water and medical treatment while it s still safest to stay home seek assistance from hospitals and relief organizations if you need it only when it s safe to do so 20 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare for a drought,droughts are prolonged periods of less than average rainfall they can last from several weeks to years causing significant hardship due to lack of water for drinking cleaning and watering crops if you live in a drought prone area it will help if you take a few measures to ensure that you and your community are as prepared as possible if a drought hits,put a water rationing plan in place in the event of a water shortage serious droughts can result in water shortages that could last weeks or months with proper rationing and conservation however you and your household can hold out for several weeks on stored drinking water if you live in a drought prone area it would be a good idea to have a plan in place for what you ll do in the event of a drought by drawing up a plan you and your family can be prepared for when a drought does hit humans require about 3 4 gallon of water daily just to live including water usage for sanitation you should plan on each person in your household using a gallon of water per day keep this figure in mind when stocking or gathering water 1 x research source also bear in mind that certain people will require more water than others usually children nursing mothers and people with chronic illnesses need more than a gallon a day if you have any of these particular cases in your household plan accordingly and stock more water 2 x research source also keep some extra water stocked in case of a medical emergency if someone gets sick or injured they ll need to drink more to stay hydrated you also will need the water to clean any wounds 3 x research source make sure everyone in your house knows the limits on water usage in the event of a drought if a situation gets dire and drinking water is getting scarce don t ration to the point of dehydration lost hikers have been found dying of dehydration when they still had water left because they were trying to conserve drink what you need to stay alive stock your home with bottled water remember that each person in your home will require at least a gallon of water daily to be properly prepared have enough bottled water to last your entire household at least a week this water should be used as a last resort in a drought use it only if drinking water gets cut off entirely 4 x research source install a rain catch system thousands of gallons of water fall on your property every year take advantage of this by harvesting some of it you can stock this rainwater for drought conditions by using it to water your lawn and cleaning in the meantime you can use it to take a good chunk out of your water bill installing one is easy 5 x research source get a large drum 55 gallons is usually standard from a hardware store get several if you plan on storing the water place the drum under a downspout gutter and run the gutter into the drum if you don t have gutters on your house place the drum under a section of your roof where water usually runs off rainwater must be thoroughly filtered before drinking you should generally only drink it in an emergency situation after boiling for three minutes 6 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source check for and repair any leaks in your home leaky pipes can waste thousands of gallons of water per year not only will this waste precious water if a drought hits but it will run up your water bill during normal times thoroughly check your home for any leaks and repair them to increase your preparedness for a drought check the faucets in your kitchen and bathrooms also look at the handles of faucets since water can escape here as well 7 x research source check your toilet to make sure no water is escaping from the back of the tank into the bowl add food coloring to the tank don t flush and check back in 30 minutes if there is color in the bowl you have a leaky seal in the tank and should get it repaired 8 x research source take a reading of your water meter then wait 30 minutes without using any water and check it again if there is any difference you have a leak somewhere if you can t locate it call a plumber to investigate 9 x research source install water efficient appliances household appliances often use much more water than they have to upgrade certain appliances in your home to water efficient versions to save money and conserve water in the event of a drought 10 x research source you can get a low flow shower head to save water while you shower install a low volume toilet to avoid wasting water while flushing 11 x research source turn water off when not in use it is a bad habit to keep the faucet running when brushing your teeth or shaving instead you ll save a lot of water by turning the faucet off while your brush or shave 12 x research source reuse water that would have been wasted there are numerous ways that household water gets wasted instead of letting water flow down the drain collect it and put it to better use 13 x research source think about when you run the shower or faucet and wait for the water to warm up this can take several seconds to a minute during which time water is running down the drain place a bucket in the sink or shower when you do this then use that water for plants so you don t have to use the hose water your lawn sparingly over watering your lawn is a big waste of water lawns usually only need to be watered once a week during the summer set an alarm to remind you to turn off the sprinkler to avoid over watering also don t water if you ve had heavy rain recently 14 x research source some localities particularly in dry places have laws about when you can water your lawn and for how long if droughts are expected governments may ban watering altogether check with your water company or county government to ensure that watering is permitted in your area before watering your lawn participate in meetings about water conservation many towns in drought prone areas meet regularly and discuss water policy if you re concerned you should attend these meetings and participate do all you can to promote efficient water usage give suggestions if you have them and if you think it s necessary organize local citizens to campaign for certain changes 15 x research source local governments often advertise meetings of this sort check local newspapers or your local government s website for notice of meetings if you can t find any meetings advertised try calling your town or city hall and asking if any upcoming meetings will discuss water policy it s possible your local government doesn t discuss such issues in this case you can form a committee of citizens to petition the government to take action on water conservation read be a community organizer for ideas on how to organize fellow citizens campaign the local government to practice water conservation just as you took steps to conserve water in your own home you can also petition the government to do the same organize citizens and call for water efficient devices and practices in government buildings and offices 16 x research source patronize businesses that practice water conservation for example some restaurants serve water only upon request which saves resources show your support for these establishments by using their services and telling your neighbors about them 17 x research source push for laws to control and clean pollution water pollution is a big problem if a drought hits the community will have less water it can use in the event of rationing if local rivers streams and lake are polluted it is a matter of public interest to clean up local water sources to prepare for a drought 18 x research source,Home-and-Garden

how to survive a volcanic eruption,volcanic activity can result in explosions called plinian eruptions that shoot rocks ash and gas hundreds of feet into the air while not all types of volcanic eruptions are so dramatic they can all be terrifying fortunately most volcanoes are carefully monitored and scientists can usually provide some advance warning before a serious event but if you live near a volcano or get an opportunity to visit one you are always at risk and it s important to know how to prepare for an eruption and escape one alive,know your community s warning system if you live near a volcano your community likely has a plan in place to warn people that the volcano may erupt in many cases sirens and emergency alerts on televisions are used to alert people that danger is imminent local radio stations will also broadcast important advisories since each region is a little different it s important to know the specific warning procedures in your area 1 x research source as soon as you hear a siren turn on the radio to find out what the local emergency management agency advises you may be told to stay indoors keep away from certain areas or in extreme cases evacuate if you don t live in the area and you re just traveling through you should still be familiar with the region s warning system so you ll know what it means when you hear it get familiar with the evacuation procedures if you live near a well researched and well monitored volcano you can probably obtain a hazard zone map from your local emergency management agency or in the u s from the u s geological survey these maps show the probable paths of lava flows and lahar or mudflows and give estimates for the minimum time it would take a flow to reach a given location they also divide the area around the volcano into zones from high risk to low risk using this information you can get some idea of how safe your house or workplace is and you can plan the best route of escape because volcanic eruptions are complex and to some extent unpredictable you should have several alternative routes to reach one or more safe zones develop a household evacuation plan figure out what you ll need to do if you hear the sirens go off map out exactly where your family will go and figure out the safest way to get there keep in mind that if the sky is filled with ash you won t be able to travel far by car since ash interferes with mechanisms in car engines and prevents them from operating correctly talk with each of your family members about the evacuation plan make sure everyone knows exactly what to do and where to meet don t forget to include your pets in your evacuation plan it s a good idea to have a checklist you can run down so you make sure you don t forget anyone or anything in the heat of the moment include a list of the people and animals that should be present the possessions you ll take with you and fast actions you might take to seal up your house to prevent as much damage as possible stock up on necessities store at least a two weeks supply of food and portable water at your home in the event of an eruption water supplies may become contaminated so you can t count on your well or public water keep all your supplies in one place a large container that you can carry for example so that you can quickly bring them with you if you need to evacuate in addition to food and water stock up on the following a first aid kit blankets and warm clothing a battery powered radio and fresh batteries so that you will be able to listen to advisories if the power goes out necessary medications a map of the region be prepared when you re traveling near a volcano if you will be visiting a volcano knowledge is your most important protection before going to the volcano consult with local authorities and heed their recommendations or warnings learn about the hazards you may encounter in the area of the volcano and get a reputable guide to accompany you if possible if you re going to be climbing or hiking near the volcano you should bring a few survival items that will help you survive if you re caught outside without access to shelter you ll need a respirator and goggles to protect your face and help you breathe bring long pants and long sleeved shirts bring plenty of water in case you become unexpectedly trapped by a lava flow and don t overexert yourself you ll be able to react more quickly and run for your life if necessary if you re not fatigued listen for radio or tv advisories if you hear the sirens go off when a volcano erupts immediately tune in to determine if you are in immediate danger where you are and also to find out what is happening around you these advisories will be your eyes to see the larger picture and help you assess the situation and make the right decisions the sirens will most likely be your first warning that an eruption is occurring but you might receive other indications that something is amiss if you see a plume of debris rising from the volcano or if you feel an earthquake tune in immediately make sure your battery operated radio is in working order in case the power goes out it s an important way to stay connected and learn about updates that can affect your safety do not ignore emergency instructions in most cases you ll be told to stay inside but you may be ordered to evacuate it s extremely important to follow the advisories whatever they may be in order to ensure your family s safety most importantly if you re told to evacuate do it right away conversely if you are not instructed to evacuate the area stay where you are unless you can see immediate danger taking to the roads may be more hazardous than staying at home in recent eruptions many people have been killed because they did not heed an evacuation order if you are lucky enough to get advance warning use it wisely instead of trying to hold your ground it s also important to evacuate the area as soon as possible after being told to do so if you wait too long you ll have to deal with ash fall which will muck up your car s engine and make it more difficult to leave get inside if you re caught outdoors unless you need to evacuate the safest place you can be is inside a strong structure close all the windows and doors to protect yourself from ash and burning cinders 2 x research source make sure all of your family members are inside and that your emergency supply of food and water is indoors with you if you own livestock bring them inside their shelter and close the doors and windows if you have time protect machinery by putting it inside a garage get to high ground if you can t find shelter lava flows lahars mudflows and flooding are common in a major eruption all of these can be deadly and all of them tend to travel in valleys and low lying areas climb to higher ground and stay there until you can confirm that the danger has passed protect yourself from pyroclastics while you want to get to higher ground you should also try to shield yourself from pyroclastics which are rocks and debris sometimes red hot that are sent flying during an eruption the most important thing to do is watch out for them and get out of their range sometimes they actually rain down and in some types of eruptions such as that which occurred at mount st helens in 1980 they can land miles from the

listening to their predictions you can develop a real sense of how much time you have to prepare check back with the nasa website as they constantly update close calls make sure to prepare well in advance sometimes astronomers know about potential impacts on the earth only a couple months beforehand move away from coastal areas because the earth is made up of 71 water there s a greater likelihood that the comet will hit a body of water 5 x research source if this does happen it could mean that giant tsunamis would be created by the initial impact and they would likely destroy our coastal cities additionally there would be an increase in water vapor entering our atmosphere which would cause heavy rain which could cause landslides and flooding 6 x research source the tsunami in india in 2004 killed 150 000 people in a single day with many more left missing the results of a tsunami from a large comet impact would be even worse even if you had an impenetrable bunker near the coast massive flooding would mean you could never leave it move into a bunker or fortified structure and outfit it with an energy source an underground bunker isn t only the best for the time of impact it will also protect you from environmental hazards after the comet has hit when the comet hits dust soot and water will shoot up into our atmosphere making it cold for months to years 7 x research source for that reason make sure you also outfit your bunker with an energy source for heat like a generator and enough fuel to last while the dust in the atmosphere settles if you re unable to get a bunker make sure to fortify whatever structure you re going to be staying in so that it can withstand the blast buildings that have strong foundations and are lower to the ground are better if you can t find a bunker try to find another location that s going to be unaffected by the impact this could be a cave or another natural structure that would shield you from the initial blast there are many different bunker options available but the best ones for a comet impact will have an air filtration system and be made of strong material bunkers can be expensive and range from anywhere from 20 000 to a million dollars and upwards purchase enough food water medicine and other supplies if the comet does hit on land dust and rock particles flying into our atmosphere will make it too dangerous to go outside for months to years make sure that you have enough food that s able to stand the test of time a radio handheld transceiver or walkie talkie and flashlights are other important pieces of gear you should stock up on make sure to stock your hide out with canned food dried goods non perishable foods and bottled water if there is more than one person staying in your location make sure that you increase the amount of food you are storing accordingly the average calorie intake for men is 2 500 calories a day and 2 000 calories for women 8 x research source buy weapons and ammunition for after the impact you may be more concerned with withstanding the destruction of the comet impact itself but you also need to be conscious of the possible dangers of other people after the dust settles if you are fully prepared for a comet impact and others are not people may want to steal your resources you should be ready to defend them unless you have enough to go around don t go overboard on purchasing guns make sure that you have things like food water and shelter before spending money on protection a semi automatic rifle and a pistol with enough ammunition should be more than enough firepower ration your food and water the amount of time that the repercussions of a comet impact would negatively affect the outside environment depends on a variety of factors like how large the comet was where it impacted and how close you are to the site of impact because of this rationing your food and water may be crucial for your survival as there s no concrete amount of time you will need to sustain on your food stores dried legumes canned beans and dried meat products provide the most protein and can be stored for a very long time nutrient rich grains and potatoes can also provide needed calories so make sure to be stocking up on these kinds of food 9 x research source as a rule of thumb try not to dip below 500 calories a day while humans are capable of surviving without food for up to 40 days while hydrated not eating enough will deteriorate your body and mind 10 x research source make sure you are eating the right kind of foods so you don t suffer from malnutrition limit your generator usage and only use it if necessary your generator will be a lifesaver for many things while you are in your bunker you can use it to produce heat cook food and power lights however because most generators run on fuel it s important that you limit its usage because you will likely have a limited amount of fuel in your bunker if you aren t in a bunker a generator may still work but there s a good chance that the main power grid will be down it s a good idea to have more than one generator in case your primary generator breaks equip your hide out with generator repair kits for possible repairs that will be needed listen to the radio to stay in communication with society there may be efforts from the government to try to help people during this catastrophe make sure to listen to the radio to see if there are any updates or initiatives that can benefit you if there are people on the radio they will likely be able to give reports on the environment outside don t believe everything you hear early reporting is notoriously inaccurate at times so wait it out until you hear unified reports 11 x research source the national weather service broadcasts emergency broadcasts on the vhf public service band which require a special radio receiver these channels range from 162 400 to 162 550 12 x research source keep yourself physically healthy any physical ailment while you are hiding out can develop into a life threatening illness because of the lack of medical care available a small cut could get infected or a cold could develop into a chest infection for that reason you should attend to any medical issues as soon as they arise while you ration your food and water you ll probably want to keep physical activity low but you should also make sure not to become frail while in your bunker and try to get exercise in if your food stores will allow it keep your mind active and stay mentally healthy it will be very easy to be negative during such a catastrophe so make sure that you keep an active mind solitary confinement has been proven to have negative physiological effects on people so it s important that you use what you have around you to stay mentally acute reading books talking to other people and doing activities will ensure you aren t stagnating and keep your mind healthy isolation has multiple negative effects on your mental health so having people with you is a good idea if you want to stay mentally healthy 13 x research source make sure the environment is safe before going out into the world use a portable air monitor to test the air outside and make sure that the levels are normal before venturing there you also need to make sure that any fires or flooding caused by the comet have subsided acid rain is also a potential result from massive fires putting pyrotoxins into the air which would make going outside deadly 14 x research source have a reason to go outside like being out of food or supplies or hearing about other groups of people who survived and wanting to join them scavenge for additional supplies and food whatever the comet did not destroy can be salvaged for use like food batteries water or anything else you d find useful from abandoned stores and houses make sure that you are not stealing from anyone and that the goods have been abandoned by their previous owners to avoid confrontations there is a chance that the location you try to scavenge in has already been sorted through depending on the length of time you ve been hiding out prepare to defend yourself from desperate survivors if you ve managed to survive the comet impact there s a good likelihood that others have as well hunger breeds violence and people will want to your steal supplies in order to survive 15 x research source always try to resolve things peacefully not violently there may be other groups willing to share resources as long as you share yours always approach people cautiously but not in a hostile manner move to a fertile place near the equator and plant vegetable seeds non perishable and canned food won t sustain you forever so you will have to get used to hunting and gathering your own food designate different people based on their strengths to search for food moving near the equator will be warmer and if the dirt is fertile this will allow you to begin to grow food for consumption having more people in your group will allow you to search for food more effectively moving near a large body of water will allow you to fish use survival guides to determine what foliage is good to eat and what is poisonous create a governance system for your new society a popular vote is a direct democracy and would work so that everyone had a voice in matters that affect the group while having a final decision maker or leader is conventionally how smaller groups tend to act having everyone s voice be heard will hopefully ensure less fighting in your group as your group gets larger the governance system becomes more critical make sure to hold everyone to the same standards,Home-and-Garden
how to request an amber alert,law enforcement can request an amber alert when a child is abducted and faces imminent harm of serious bodily injury or death members of the public cannot request an amber alert instead they can contact law enforcement and report that the child is missing law enforcement will gather the necessary information and decide if an amber alert is appropriate although the process will vary slightly depending on your state there is a general process for law enforcement to request amber alerts,ask for details of the abduction you will want to know where and when the abduction took place also try to get other relevant information about the abduction which could aid in finding the child 1 x research source the identification of any witnesses whether the person reporting the abduction suspects the child is in serious danger why the child is in serious danger take down the child s information you will need detailed information about the child before you can issue an alert accordingly you should request from the child s parents the following information 2 x research source 3 x research source name age and date of birth height weight sex race eye color hair color what the child was wearing any other unique physical characteristics a photograph of the child ask for information about the suspected abductor you also need detailed information about the suspected abductor gather the following information 4 x research source 5 x research source name age and date of birth sex race height weight eye color hair color what the suspected abductor was wearing any unique physical characteristics a photograph of the abductor if one is available request information about the abductor s vehicle the abductor might be identified by the vehicle he or she drives accordingly you should gather this information as well 6 x research source 7 x research source make model year color license plate number and state any other descriptors for the car determine that the child has been abducted before submitting the amber alert law enforcement should reasonably believe that the child has been abducted this is a judgment call you have to make 8 x research source however your state might have specific guidelines for example in texas an abduction occurs in the following situations 9 x research source if the child is abducted by a parent or legal guardian the abduction was in the course of an attempted murder or if the child is 13 or younger he or she was taken without permission by someone unrelated and more than three years older or by another parent or legal guardian who attempted to commit murder at the time of the abduction identify the child s risk of bodily injury or death you can only issue the alert if you believe the child faces serious risk of bodily injury or death the danger must also be imminent 10 x research source this means that it will happen very soon 11 x research source accordingly you should look at all of the information that you have and decide the child s level of harm the purpose of this requirement is not to overburden the amber alert system with regular abduction cases where the child does not face substantial bodily injury or worse check that you have enough descriptive information an alert will only be effective if the descriptions of the child the abductor and the abductor s vehicle are sufficiently detailed that law enforcement will be able to find the child 12 x research source remember that amber alerts can be sent out over the radio department of transportation signs digital billboards and other mediums 13 x research source law enforcement and public citizens who see the alert need to be able to identify the child or abductor without a photograph for this reason you need sufficiently detailed information confirm the child s age you can only send an alert if the child meets your state s age criteria the age will vary depending on your state however the federal government has required that states honor each other s requests if the child is under 18 14 x research source for this reason most states have an age limit of 17 or younger get the form there should be a form for you to fill out and send to your state agency you should ask someone in your department for the form alternately you could look online to see if your state s form has been published complete the reporting agency information each state s form will be different however you will probably need to enter information about your department enter the following information legibly 15 x research source whether this is an initial request or an update the agency s name and contact information the name and title of the investigating officer the investigating officer s cell phone number a phone number for media inquiries submit the form the form should tell you how to submit the amber alert request to your state s centralized office typically you can email the form or fax it look at the form to find the email address and fax number 16 x research source if you email the form then make sure to keep a copy saved to your desktop so that you can refer back to it if you need to enter data into the national crime information center system not every jurisdiction requires this step however entering the information into the fbi s database will allow the alert to be broadcast across state lines be sure to flag the case as child abduction after entering the necessary information 17 x research source,Home-and-Garden

how to survive a public shooting,although the odds of being involved in a mass shooting are relatively low public shootings have increased drastically over the last few years 1 x research source in a moment of crisis it can be easy to feel frightened overwhelmed and confused knowing how to react appropriately 2 x research source in such a situation can increase your chance of survival and that of others should you ever find yourself in danger,remain calm it s natural to panic in an emergency like a public shooting but panicking causes people to react emotionally rather than thoughtfully 3 x research source it may seem impossible to keep calm during an emergency but there are a few things you can do to remain level headed focus on your breath count to three while breathing in hold your breath to the count of three then exhale to the count of three 4 x research source you can and should do this while moving to safety but controlling your breath can help you from hyperventilating or making rash decisions alert others once you realize that there is an active shooter situation you should alert others nearby some people may not have noticed that an incident has been unfolding while others may be frozen with fear announce to everyone else around you that you believe there is an active shooter situation and that everyone needs to get out or hide 5 x research source know the plan it s imperative that you have a plan in place of what to do in case of an emergency training and preparation can help you escape to safety but remember to always have a backup plan if you can t follow your primary plan evaluate whether or not you can follow your backup plan 6 x research source prepare to run many people freeze up in an emergency if a shooter is active you may feel the urge to remain still and hide however experts advise that hiding should only be an option if you cannot safely escape 7 x research source if you know of an escape route that will keep you at a safe distance from the shooter resist the urge to freeze up and force yourself to run as long as you can do so safely visualize your movements it s important to plan your escape route and be aware of your surroundings if there are possible positions along the route where the shooter could potentially ambush you or others recognize this and anticipate how you would respond if that were to happen 8 x research source most shooters aim at arbitrary targets the harder you are to see and hit the safer you will be so try to be rational and avoid entering into the shooter s line of sight 9 x research source if you re in the vicinity of the shooter try to find an escape route that gives you both concealment to stay out of view of the shooter and cover to protect you from bullets 10 x research source get out if you can when an active shooter is in your vicinity even though you re afraid it s important to keep moving and to get as far away from the situation and the shooter as possible don t stick around to watch or figure out what is going on but put as much distance between you and the shooter this will make it difficult for the shooter to shoot you and reduces the chance that you ll be shot by random fire 11 x research source note that this is only possible if the shooter has not noticed you if you re lost in a crowd or if you hear gunshots from a distance but have not yet seen the shooter if you can help others without endangering yourself try to do so 12 x research source try to escape even if others insist on staying encourage the other people you pass to leave with you 13 x research source however if others are uncertain about running don t wait for them to decide it s important that you get out first and foremost 14 x research source leave your stuff remember that your life is what s important not your phone or other belongings don t delay your escape trying to grab material items and if you see anyone else trying to gather their things tell them to leave their material possessions behind 15 x research source use any exit you can take any exit you can to escape including emergency exits and emergency windows most restaurants movie theaters and other public places have doors and exits designated for staff in stockrooms and kitchens for example so look for and use these if possible 16 x research source call emergency services once you are removed from the situation and have made a safe exit call 911 or find someone with a phone to make the call 17 x research source stay as far away from the building as possible once you re outside prevent passersby and others from entering the situation alert people outside the building of what is happening inside and advise them to also stay as far away as possible find a hiding spot choose a spot that is out of the shooter s visual field and that can provide protection if shots are fired your way ideally your hiding place should not trap you and make you a sitting duck an ideal hiding place should have adequate space for you to move and escape if you need to 18 x research source be quick in deciding where to hide try to secure a place to hide as soon as you can if you can t find a room with a door that can lock to hide in try to hide behind something that can conceal your body like a photocopier or filing cabinet keep quiet turn off the lights if there are lights and be silent be sure to turn off both your phone s ringer and its ability to vibrate 19 x research source resist the urge to cough or sneeze and do not try to talk to anyone else who may be hiding near you remember that if you re hiding the last thing you want to do is have the shooter notice you 20 x research source don t call the authorities even though you may be tempted if you re in a populated place like a restaurant or school chances are that some people escaped or heard the gunfire and will alert law enforcement block the hiding spot if you are in a room lock the door or block it with something heavy like a filing cabinet or sofa make it as difficult as possible for the shooter to enter the room 21 x research source making it difficult for the shooter to get into a room keeps you safe and also buys you time if you or someone else has called the police they should respond in a matter of minutes even just two to three minutes is a significant amount of time in an emergency situation 22 x research source stay low and horizontal lie on the floor face down with your arms near but not covering your head this facedown position protects your internal organs in addition if the shooter comes across you in this position he may assume you re already dead laying low to the ground also reduces your chance of being shot by a stray bullet 23 x research source keep away from the door some shooters will just shoot through a locked door rather than try to enter it or break it down since bullets can go through doors it s best to stay away from that area fight as a last resort do not try to fight the shooter if you can safely escape or hide from the assailant 24 x research source fighting should be a last resort but if you must fight it s important to go into full survival mode 25 x research source find items to use as weapons locate anything you can use to hit or harm the shooter such as a chair or fire extinguisher or pot of hot coffee most people won t have armed weapons on hand so you ll need to improvise and use what you ve got around you 26 x research source you could hold the object in front of your body to deflect the shots or throw it at the shooter scissors or letter openers can be used as a knife even a pen could be used as a weapon particularly since you give it leverage with the back of your thumb 27 x research source if there is a fire extinguisher nearby grab it you can spray the fire extinguisher in the shooter s face or use the object itself to bash the shooter in the head 28 x research source incapacitate the shooter fighting back against the shooter is always a last resort if your life is endangered if you cannot escape or hide work alone or with others to fight try to find a way to get the gun out of his hands or to knock him down to disorient him 29 x research source encourage others to try and help you working as a group will give you an advantage over the solitary shooter 30 x research source be physically aggressive if the shooter is very close you could try to disarm him again only if your life is absolutely in danger whatever you do it s important that you act fast and focus on disarming or incapacitating the shooter 31 x research source if the shooter has a rifle grab the barrel and turn it away from you while striking or kicking him at the same time the shooter will likely try to get control of the weapon back but if you follow his movement he may be caught off guard and get thrown off balance if you can get the butt end of the rifle as well then you ll have both ends and can use the weapon as leverage to further kick knee or push the assailant 32 x research source if the shooter has a pistol try to grab it by the barrel from the top so that he cannot point it at you with many models grabbing the pistol from the top keeps the gun from cycling properly so while the already chambered round will fire the next round won t be chambered without manually racking the slide try to aim high when attempting to bring down the shooter his hands and the weapon are the most dangerous parts of him during a shooting otherwise try for the eyes face shoulder and neck 33 x research source stay committed even though you may be scared particularly if you re armed with a broom and you know the shooter has an assault rifle stay focused on getting that rifle out of his hands and bringing him down think of your life and the lives of others he may go after fortunately your body s natural fight response should be triggered and keep you alert and focused on staying alive whatever the costs 34 x research source remain calm if you ve escaped the situation try to breath deeply chances are that you may be experiencing feelings of panic or shock or numbness due to the trauma so it s best to try to get your bearings by centering your focus on your breathing 35 x research source when you feel able to talk you should call your family and loved ones to let them know that you re alright keep your hands visible at all times law enforcement s first task is to stop the shooter so as you emerge from the building or public place always keep your hands up to show that you are not carrying any weapons police are trained to initially treat everyone as a suspect since some shooters pretend to impersonate victims 36 x research source avoid pointing or yelling the police have specific guidelines on how to proceed during a public shooting let them do their jobs and don t confuse or aggravate the situation by intervening particularly since your emotions are likely heightened let them do their jobs effectively and take down the shooter 37 x research source know that help for the injured is coming the police are trained to locate and stop shooters and this is their primary goal they will not stop and tend to the injured but you needn t worry as paramedics have likely already been called to care for those shot or otherwise hurt during the incident 38 x research source if you have been shot try to slow your breathing which can help prevent shock and slow the bleeding cover the wound with your hands or a cloth and apply pressure to try to stop the bleeding until you can get medical aid,Home-and-Garden
how to close hurricane shutters,hurricane shutters can keep your windows from breaking due to strong winds and flying debris no matter what kind of hurricane shutters you have you can quickly close them with a few simple steps,unlock the shutters the first thing you need to do is make sure the shutters are unlocked there should be a lock with a keyhole on one side of the window frame put the key into the keyhole and turn it to unlock the shutters 1 x research source disengage the locking rods if your shutters have locking rods you ll need to disengage them there is likely one on the bottom on either side of the window turn each handle to unlock the rods the top rods will raise up and the lower rods will slide down 2 x research source the locking rods hold the shutters out of the way when they re not in use pull the shutters to the center of the window grasp the edge of the shutter on one side and pull it toward the center of the window frame repeat on the other side the shutters should meet in the middle 3 x research source fit the grooves together fit the outside blade on one shutter into the inside groove in the other the inside blade on the other shutter should also fit into the outside groove of the first shutter 4 x research source lock the shutters simply push on the lock to snap it closed 5 x research source engage the locking rods pull the locking rods on the bottom of the shutters upwards lower the locking rods on the top of the shutters 6 x research source the locking rods keep the shutters from rattling in strong winds fit the provided tool over the lowering mechanism roll down shutters come with a tool to lower them the tool is a long metal bar with a crank on one end the other end fits over the lowering mechanism which is located in the top corner of shutter housing 7 x research source turn the crank to the left to lower the shutters once the tool is in place spin the crank to the left continue spinning until the shutters have lowered completely over the window 8 x research source remove the tool and store it for future use when the shutters are in place you can remove the tool from the lowering mechanism be sure to store it somewhere handy so you can use it to raise the shutters after the storm has passed 9 x research source remove the pins securing the shutters to the siding to keep your shutters from banging against your home they are likely secured to the siding with the help of a pin remove each pin connecting the shutters to the siding 10 x research source swing the shutters in toward the center of the window grasp the edge of one shutter and swing it inward 180 degrees repeat with the other shutter so the windows are covered and the shutters meet in the center 11 x research source put the storm bar in place across both shutters there are brackets on the outside of the shutters that hold the storm bar in place fit the storm bar into these brackets 12 x research source secure the storm bar with screws and wingnuts insert a screw into each hole in the bracket then screw a wingnut onto each screw to keep them in place you should be able to do this by hand and won t need any tools 13 x research source you will likely need 4 screws and 4 wingnuts 1 on each side and 2 in the middle of the shutters inspect your shutters once a year before hurricane season each year you should take the time to check out your shutters and complete any necessary maintenance aim to do this before hurricane season arrives so you don t find problems as you re preparing for a storm 14 x research source if you notice any major problems or if the shutters need repairs contact the manufacturer or a qualified technician remove dirt and debris from the tracks if necessary dirt dust and other grime can build up in the tracks of your shutters making them difficult to open and close use a vacuum with a small nozzle tip to suck up any debris from the tracks 15 x research source you could also use a leaf blower to blow debris out of the tracks spray silicone lubricant onto any moving parts for accordion shutters spray the lubricant into the lock track and grooves you can also spray it onto the track or rollers on the top and bottom of the shutters as well as the grooves on the shutters so they open and close easily for colonial shutters you just need to lubricate the hinges on either side 16 x research source pick up a silicone lubricant from your local hardware store avoid using wd 40 or another oily lubricant as they can attract dirt and salt 17 x research source lubricate the thumbscrews for the locking rods if applicable if the thumbscrews are rusty or seized you may not be able to engage or disengage the locking rods use a screwdriver to remove them then smear a tiny bit of white lithium grease on the threads screw them back into place using a screwdriver 18 x research source you could use petroleum jelly as an alternative to white lithium grease,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a gas attack,if you are exposed to toxic gas as a result of a terrorist action or general attack it s important to act quickly to preserve your health if the gas is indoors go outside if the gas is present outside seek shelter indoors minimize your exposure to the gas by covering your skin up with a mask or hazmat suit if you ve made contact with toxic gas strip off your clothes as soon as it s safe and take a decontamination shower continue to reach out for official updates via your phone the t v or radio,react right away if you smell or see toxic gases an unusual smell may be one of the only warning signs that you are being exposed to a gas attack although not all toxic gases have a unique scent many do look for a discolored cloud in the air this cloud might dissipate quickly or appear to linger in the air 1 x research source as soon as you ve smelled the gas scent it means that you ve been exposed you ll need to take immediate action to limit or counter the effects of the gas sulfur mustard gas can be odorless or smell like mustard or onions chlorine gas often has a pineapple pepper or bleach scent sulfur mustard gas can appear brown or yellow in the air however it can also be clear and invisible to the naked eye like sarin gas exit the building if you detect gas inside if you smell or see gas in the air leave the building space as quickly as possible your goal should be to get to fresh air because staying inside will only expose you to a concentrated amount of the gas if necessary climb out of a nearby window and stay outside until help arrives 2 x research source take the path to exit the building that appears to dodge any clouds or concentrations of the gas if visible seek shelter indoors if you see signs of gas outside bring any pets or family members inside as well if you see neighbors or other people outside yell for them to seek shelter immediately do not try to outrun a cloud of gas in your car or on foot as you could get overtaken with no shelter options 3 x research source staying outdoors will expose you to a higher concentration of the gas moving indoors will not provide complete protection from the gas but it will minimize your exposure until you can get help if you are outdoors and indoor shelter isn t available try to get to higher ground most chemical gases will sink to the ground so being higher up will lessen your exposure cut your indoor space off from outside exposure close any doors or windows close all air vents and shut off your air conditioning or heating units shut any fireplace dampers or any other open spaces that lead to the outside 4 x research source the goal here is to block off any and all openings that will allow the gas to move from outside to indoors these actions will help to keep your indoor air as uncontaminated as possible go to the most isolated room indoors once you are inside make your way to the smallest room with the fewest windows or least access outdoors use spare fabric plastic or any other available material to block off the edges of the doorframe especially concentrating on the gap at the bottom 5 x research source if you have duct tape apply it to the edges of the door and any windows although it isn t always 100 effective moving to a small isolated space can improve the quality of air that you ll breathe during a gas attack put on any protective gear that you own if you have a hazmat suit get into it at the first threat of gas exposure if you have a gas mask put it on as well a mask or suit may not prevent you from gas exposure but it can decrease it until help arrives or the attack subsides 6 x research source for example nerve agents such as vx cause damage through skin contact so only a full weapons grade hazmat suit will protect you make sure that your suit or mask fits you securely a mask or suit with gaps on the edges can easily let gas slip inside some suits or masks also require power sources typically batteries or air canisters you should always store your protective gear with extras of these important components if you are without a mask or suit pull up your shirt so that the fabric covers your mouth and nose the fabric will act as a temporary makeshift air filter hold a urine soaked cotton cloth on your face in the event of a chlorine attack a government grade gas mask is an even better option but in an emergency this will create a temporary usable mask the urine will absorb into the cotton fabric and crystalize the chlorine gas this type of mask also only lasts until the urine dries out 7 x research source a handkerchief or any other fabric can also be used as the base of the mask watch out for the tell tale scent of bleach that often indicates a chlorine attack this type of mask was used by soldiers in wwi to survive chlorine gas attacks remove and dispose of your clothing if you ve been exposed to gas as soon as you are in a safe place take off the clothing that you were wearing during the attack take care to touch it as little as possible to avoid spreading the gas remnants to your hands then seal the clothing twice over in a plastic bag or bin 8 x research source if possible cut your clothes off instead of pulling them up over your head which can help limit your exposure to the gas rinse your body off with clean water take a hot shower for at least 10 minutes to help cleanse your skin of the gas scrub your whole body with soap if available rinsing your eyes out with clean water or saline for 5 10 minutes can also help to minimize the possibility of eye damage 9 x research source use your emergency radio to keep track of official safety reports if you have an emergency radio bring it into the room with you and turn it to an available frequency monitor any reports that you hear regarding the progress and effects of the gas attack if your cell phone is available and working reach out to emergency professionals inform them of your location and request assistance 10 x research source realistically in the event of a gas attack you can expect to wait some time before receiving any emergency assistance or perhaps even updates try to stay in contact with the outside world the best that you can to avoid running down your radio or phone batteries check for news at particular intervals such as every 30 minutes seek out supportive medical care use your cell phone to call or text for emergency services in the event of a large scale gas attack you ll likely have to call many times and may have to wait a long period before getting help when you do see a medical professional they will assess your injuries and develop a treatment plan that fits your condition and the overall situation 11 x research source toxic gas exposure often requires continuous monitoring because your symptoms do not always develop rapidly with chlorine exposure pulmonary edemas can develop up to a day after initial exposure not all gas exposures can be treated the same chlorine gas exposure for example requires close monitoring of the pulmonary system including oxygen treatments it s advisable to stay indoors for as long as you can post attack as it takes some gases days to dissipate unless you are critically injured the best plan initially is to shelter in place and wait for medical help to come to you take an antidote if available as soon as possible not all chemical gases have antidotes but some do if you are exposed to an agent seek out a medical professional they will then determine if an antidote exists and is available for use 12 x research source sarin gas for example is treatable with an antidote however it must be used within hours of exposure,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare for a power outage,a bit of careful planning can go a long way towards protecting and caring for your family and home in the event of a power outage start your preparations by developing an emergency plan including lists of critical phone numbers pack and keep emergency and first aid kits readily accessible make sure that you ll be comfortable until the power is restored by storing ample food and water creating a stash of fun board games and books can also help you to relax and pass the time,create a family emergency plan document some power outages are planned well in advance but others are the result of an emergency situation such as flood or tornado before you lose power sit down with your family and write down what each family member will do in case of an outage give each person specific responsibilities such as gathering flashlights and discuss how you all will communicate in case the internet or landlines go down 1 x research source give these documents to extended family members and friends as well this will help them to know where to find you and how to contact you in the event of an emergency 2 x research source go through as many different scenarios as possible when creating this document for example talk about what you will do if it is unsafe to drive due to downed power lines in your area some organizations like the red cross have downloadable templates available online that you can use to start the process of creating your own customized plan make an emergency numbers contact list print out a list of all important numbers and place this somewhere safe and easy to access such as in an emergency cabinet file this list should include numbers for the power company the local fire department hospital personal doctor and other emergency agencies 3 x research source sign up for emergency services text messages go online to the website for your local government disaster agency like fema branches and see if they offer text or email alerts for power outages or other emergencies this is a great free way to give yourself a few extra minutes of preparation time prior to an actual outage also go ahead and sign up for any notifications offered by your power company then you will know if they have any planned outages coming up for your area 4 x research source talk with your power company about what to expect before an outage occurs call your power company and discuss with them what their protocol is in the event of a residential power loss ask them how they will contact you and how they go about determining which areas to service first this may seem like a hassle but it will be great information to have in the event of an outage power companies recognize that some people rely on electricity to keep critical medical devices up and running if this is the case for you alert your company and they will put you on a priority service list 5 x research source get a functional weather radio if your outage is weather related then you will want to keep a close eye on developing conditions cell service may be unreliable during these situations so a battery or hand crank radio is your best option this may seem an antiquated way of getting information but it actually works really well in storm situations 6 x research source many emergency agencies such as the red cross sell weather radios online charge your cell phone do your best to keep your phone fully charged before an outage strikes try to maintain a full battery by shutting off any unused apps and minimizing the brightness of your screen shifting your phone into airplane mode will also help to keep the battery full 7 x trustworthy source u s department of energy official site for the u s department of energy which provides resources

appliances such as stand alone microwaves could be damaged if not unplugged 9 x research source purchase extra batteries or chargers for small electronics that you would like to use during an outage such as a cell phone include extra charging devices in your emergency kit a car charger for example can help keep your cell phone powered up additional batteries can help keep your flashlights going 10 x research source if you use a wheelchair or other assistance device talk to the manufacturer about what non electric charging options are available 11 x research source store electronic information on a flash drive or the cloud in the event that the power is out for an extended period there may be some important documents like insurance coverage materials that you need to access keeping copies of these items on a portable drive or cloud location makes it possible to access them anywhere 12 x research source these extra copies can also keep your information safe in the event that a power surge does damage your laptop or other devices purchase and learn to operate a home generator choosing a generator can be a tricky process it is often best to consult with an electrician who can instruct you regarding how to buy install and work your generator some generators tie directly into the home power source whereas others are portable but provide less overall power operating a generator safely is extremely important as they can put off toxic fumes if not properly ventilated or installed 13 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source if you plan to use a generator go ahead and install carbon monoxide alarms in all rooms and gathering spaces of your home 14 x research source know how to manually release your garage door many doors operate with electricity and you may want to drive your car even while your power is still off first you ll need to locate your door s release lever it may look like a plastic handle attached at the end of a rope towards the back of your garage or a metal slide lever to the side of the doors practice lifting this release lever to manually raise your garage door without using electricity 15 x research source if there are downed power lines in the street it is generally not safe to drive and it may be better to keep your car in the garage protected create or restock your emergency preparedness kit get a duffle bag or plastic bin and put the following items inside a flashlight and batteries a whistle for signaling cash a dust mask manual can

how to measure radiation,while the units of measurement are a little tricky with attention to detail and the right tools you can measure ionizing radiation quickly and easily learn the ins and outs of using detection devices and familiarize yourself with the various ways of measuring radiation the first is count rate or the detected number of particles released by unstable atoms in a specific amount of time measured in counts per minute cpm you can t tell how dangerous radiation is from measuring count rate alone to assess health risk you ll need to measure radiation dose and identify the specific type of radiation present,purchase a detection device online or at a lab supplier look for radiation meters online or at a laboratory supplier devices that detect radiation include geiger counters ionization chambers and personal dosimeters in general devices detect contamination measure dose or do both 1 x research source generally geiger counters are the easiest way to find radioactive contamination and measure exposure some geiger counters only measure radioactivity some just measure radiation exposure and others measure both factors while those used professionally can cost thousands of dollars u s you can find accurate digital devices that measure both values for 300 to 500 meters with analog displays that only measure one factor are available for around 100 people who work around radiation such as x ray technicians usually track radiation dose with wearable personal dosimeters these devices sound an alarm when radiation dose levels reach unhealthy levels but they can t be used to locate radioactive material 2 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source turn on the device and if necessary set it to the lowest scale radiation detectors with analog displays have a switch or button that adjusts the display s scale before you conduct your survey set the scale to x1 to help ensure an accurate reading 3 x research source analog devices that measure radioactivity display a scale of counts per minute in intervals of 100 for meters that measure both radioactivity and exposure there ll be an additional scale in msv h millisieverts per hour the international unit for dose rate or mr h milliroentgen per hour a unit for dose rate sometimes used in the u s suppose you re measuring radioactivity and take a reading of 100 cpm if the scale is set to x10 instead of x1 the actual count is 10 times 100 or 1 000 cpm say you re measuring dose rate and get a reading of 0 01 msv h which looks safe if your scale is set to x100 the dose rate is actually 1 msv h which is extremely dangerous setting the scale is a must for meters with analog displays however it s unnecessary for most meters with digital displays check your device s manual for specific operating instructions perform a battery check if you have an analog meter find a switch labeled range or a bat button press the button or flip the switch then check the display the needle of an analog display should jump to an area on the scale marked bat test or bat if the needle doesn t move to the bat test or bat area replace the battery 4 x research source check your manual for battery replacement instructions for your specific meter for meters with digital displays you ll see an icon or an indication such as low bat when it s time to replace the battery a low battery will lead to inaccurate results so performing a test or checking a digital display first is essential hold the probe within 1 2 in 1 3 cm of the surface you re surveying you ll either pass a wand or the device itself over the surface to take a reading hold the meter by its grip and don t touch the end don t allow the end of device or wand to touch anything while in use including the object or person you re surveying 5 x research source if your device has a wand check the cable that runs between the wand and the main body look for nicks or loose connections at either end with the device on gently wiggle the cable at both connectors if the readings start changing erratically the cable is defective 6 x research source move the probe about 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm per second watch the display and listen to the audio response as you slowly pass the device or wand over the surface stop moving the probe if the needle or digital display number spikes or if the audio response ticks faster pause over the area where your numbers spiked for about 5 to 10 seconds to get an accurate measurement 7 x research source if you re scanning a person start at their head then pass the probe over their chest and back in overlapping s shapes pass the meter straight up and down their arms and legs and be sure to scan their hands feet and soles of their feet 8 x research source adjust the scale if necessary if you re using a meter with an analog meter face it ll likely have list cpm numbers in increments of 100 up to 500 a meter that measures both cpm and msv hr or mr hr will also have a scale that lists these units in increments of 0 5 if the needle jumps to the end of the display you ll need to set the meter to the next highest scale in order to get an accurate reading 9 x research source say you re measuring radioactivity and the actual count is 1 300 cpm if the meter is set to x1 it can only display counts up to 500 cpm if you set it to 10x the needle will hover over 130 and you ll get an accurate measurement use a geiger counter that measures counts per minute or second to measure radioactivity use a device that counts the number of subatomic particles emitted by a radioactive substance the standard unit for this measurement is called the becquerel bq which is equal to 1 particle or count per second 10 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source geiger counters that detect radioactivity usually display readings in cpm but you might find one that displays bq or counts per second cps 11 x research source radioactive atoms are unstable and they release matter or energy to try to become stable this process is called radioactivity geiger counters that only detect radioactivity are useful for finding radioactive contamination but they can t provide precise information about exposure or dose 12 x research source conduct a background reading turn on your device check the battery and ensure it s working properly hold the device or wand over a cold spot or something you don t suspect to be radioactive background radiation is everywhere so you should get a reading of anywhere between 5 and 100 cpm 13 x research source look online to find the average background radiation in your area compare your readings with this range to make sure your device is working recall that 60 cpm equals 1 bq since 60 counts per minute equals 1 count per second if your meter measures in bq multiply the reading by 60 to convert it to cpm a reading of 0 4 bq for instance would be 24 cpm background radiation depends on several factors for example higher elevations receive more radiation from space so the count would be higher on a mountain or in a plane pass the meter over the object s surface slowly hold the wand or device about 1 2 in 1 3 cm over the object or person you re scanning background radiation levels change randomly so don t be surprised if you see readings jump by 5 cpm then suddenly drop by 10 cpm 14 x research source if the audio response ticks faster or if the needle or displayed numbers spike dramatically stop moving the probe for 5 to 10 seconds check for counts more than twice the background reading keep your background reading in mind as you scan generally a count more than twice or 100 cpm higher than the background reading indicates radioactive contamination 15 x research source suppose your background reading is 10 to 20 cpm a count of 160 cpm would indicate contamination but not necessarily enough to pose immediate danger on the other hand a reading of 3 000 or 10 000 cpm might be a cause for concern in the u s a background reading of 100 cpm is considered an alert level guidelines vary by location so look online to find the standards for your state or province keep in mind a cpm measurement doesn t tell you about the type or dose of radiation present some types of radiation are more harmful than others so a cpm measurement alone can t tell you if a radioactive substance is dangerous estimate your annual dose with an online calculator you can get a rough estimate of your annual radiation exposure without using any devices calculate your annual dose by entering the area you live how long you ve spent on a plane whether you ve had a ct scan or x ray and other information into an online tool 16 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source estimate your annual radiation dose at https www epa gov radiation calculate your radiation dose identify radiation dose with a device that measures grays or sieverts some geiger counters and other detection devices can measure dose or the amount of radiation a body or object absorbs in the u s the unit for this measurement is called the radiation absorbed dose rad the standard unit used internationally is called the gray gy 1 gy equals 100 rad 17 x research source a device that detects dose may display measurements in rad gy millisieverts msv or millisieverts per hour msv h the sievert is a unit that measures the effective dose or the health risk of an absorbed dose of radiation a millisievert equals 0 001 sievert geiger counters don t measure ambient radiation as accurately as ionization chambers however ionization chambers are more expensive generally harder to use and must be precisely calibrated 18 x research source set your device to detect a particular type of radiation if necessary some meters measure exposure rate and need to be calibrated for a specific type of radiation for a device with a digital display you ll use buttons to toggle between alpha beta gamma and x radiation x ray settings check your user guide for specific instructions on calibrating the type of radiation 19 x research source some devices use beta radiation shields which must be manually opened and closed in order to switch between radiation types 20 x research source your device may automatically make adjustments for specific types of radiation check your manual to be sure move the meter over the object or person slowly pass the wand or device over the surface at a rate of 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm per second be sure not to let the end of the wand or detection device touch anything keep your eye on the meter and stop for 5 to 10 seconds if the meter spikes 21 x research source remember that gy and rad measure a dose and msv measures health risk if your device measures radiation dose in msv or msv h you ll know the biological risk and won t have to make any further calculations the average person is exposed to 2 to 4 msv a msv annually which equals about 0 002 to 0 0045 msv h msv per hour levels above 1 msv h such as inside a nuclear power plant are considered high radiation areas multiply the dose by a quality factor to assess the biological risk if your device doesn t measure msv h you can use a gy or rad measurement to calculate biological risk each type of radiation has a quality factor q or a number that describes its effect on organic tissue using your meter to scan for specific types of radiation in gy or rad multiply your measurement by the type s quality factor 22 x research source alpha particles are the most harmful type of radiation and have a quality factor of 20 gy x 20 sv for proton and neutron radiation use the formula sv gy x 10 gamma and x rays have a quality factor of 1 sv gy x 1 in the u s the unit roentgen equivalent man rem is sometimes used instead of the sievert if your measurements are in rad use the formula rem rad x q,Home-and-Garden

yourself trapped in your car whether relatively near others or in an isolated area can quickly turn into a shivering starving thirsty nightmare surviving in your car during a snowstorm requires calm so you can make wise use of your car to meet your two fundamental needs shelter for warmth and enough water to drink stocking up on additional supplies for this type of situation will help cover those needs and meet others such as eating staying dry and being able to leave once the storm clears,know your level of danger in most cold weather climates people know or learn what is reasonably safe for winter driving and what conditions are dangerous in most industrialized countries weather forecasting makes it unlikely that blizzards will arrive without warning even a severe snowstorm is generally expected several days in advance during a severe snowstorm travel should be curtailed unless it is a real emergency and even then consider if emergency vehicles are more equipped to handle your issue than you are if you are unfamiliar with driving in winter conditions as a general rule do not drive take winter weather advisories watches and warnings or equivalents seriously having to re schedule your vacation may be an inconvenience but getting into a car accident is a much bigger problem keep a few useful winter tools a more detailed list will follow below most drivers will not typically have an entire trunk full of emergency items but in most cold weather climates drivers should usually keep the following as a precaution sand or cat litter for emergency traction the weight of sand can also help traction in lighter vehicles although fuel efficiency will be reduced slightly cat litter has the added bonus if put in a tied off sock on the dashboard of drawing in moisture and preventing condensation on the windshield wool blanket in case of getting stuck this helps with freezing temperatures it is also handy for impromptu seating in winter events extra boots if you are wearing inappropriate foot gear your feet could freeze putting an old pair of boots in the trunk helps cover this issue also it is handy if you forgot your boots and it snows extra gloves hat scarf in case of being stuck in freezing weather these items are vital these can be old and mismatched but they should be warm keep your car well serviced before winter arrives or you plan to drive in snowy conditions make sure your anti freeze and windshield wiper fluids are full your wipers are working properly your tires are properly inflated and have sufficient tread and that your brakes and battery are both in good shape check to ensure all of your lights work and that your engine oil has been changed freezing temperatures and bad road conditions greatly affect how both the mechanics of your vehicle function and how your vehicle handles on the road 1 x research source have plenty of gas when the weather is bad make sure you have a full tank of gas in really hazardous winter weather watches and blizzard watches the effects of the storm can be 72 hours or more so the more gas you have the better in case you become stranded you will need it to help you stay warm to ensure your fuel lines do not freeze that your battery stays charged and that you have enough gas left to leave after the storm if needed 2 x research source 3 x research source buy a cooler and a storage tub your first priorities are supplies needed to provide warmth fluids and food followed by various instruments needed to weather and escape the storm a hard walled cooler to store both your food and water supplies is nearly ideal also get a hard plastic durable storage tub for the rest of your supplies it needs a tight sealing lid so if you must take it out of your vehicle nothing inside will get wet 4 x research source collect items for staying warm during a blizzard or snowstorm when temperatures are below freezing a person can only survive for about three hours without shelter from wind and moisture two of the ways a person s body loses heat since your vehicle will be your shelter you want to add supplemental items keep heat inside the vehicle using insulating items such as newspapers or blankets keep heat inside your body clothing and blankets for example do not provide heat or warmth but they re vital because they preserve or help trap the heat your body generates hypothermia which only requires a 2 3 degree drop in a person s body temperature is the chief cause of death from exposure to freezing temperatures the first effect is an inability to think clearly put one wool blanket for each person you anticipate could be in the vehicle in your trunk or in the storage tub plus two more for other uses wool dries quickly if it gets wet and keeps you much warmer than many other materials you want to also add an extra set of clothing for each person plus two sets of socks per person wool socks are best avoid cotton clothing such as jeans as these become essentially useless at retaining warmth when wet include scarves hats and water resistant gloves to help preserve heat in high loss areas like the head and neck and to keep your hands from becoming wet keep a pair of winter boots in the car in northern rural climates it is fairly common for people to keep a pair of boots typically old in the trunk in an emergency bad footwear can be dangerous in the snow leading to frostbite keep hand warmers in the car while good gloves or mittens are better prevention these are handy you can get in the camping and hunting goods sections of big box stores get 5 10 newspapers depending upon your vehicle size to insulate your vehicle s windows this will help trap in the heat your bodies produce the heat your vehicle produces if and when you turn it on and to serve as a barrier against the wind 5 x research source 6 x research source 7 x research source 8 x research source prepare for your water needs a person can survive for three days without fluids though it would not be a pleasant experience by any means to stay adequately hydrated a person should consume 64 ounces of fluids per day the typical water bottle is about 15 16 ounces which would be 12 13 bottles per person for a 72 hour period for a family of five that s 60 65 bottles of water an unrealistic number to carry in your vehicle at all times while jugs are an alternative the plastic used is more likely to warp and break when exposed to extreme temperatures therefore the following is recommended yes you can melt snow to produce water however snow is mostly air and produces surprisingly little water while a camp stove burner or campfire could potentially melt snow to produce water this is not ideal put enough water bottles in the cooler for each person for one day so for example you would put about 20 bottles in the cooler for a family of five if you have extra room load up with as many bottles as possible since this won t be enough if you re stranded for longer than one day you ll need to melt snow to do this you need the following a 2 to 3 pound coffee can with its lid several boxes of waterproof matches three 2 diameter candles and one or more metal cups 9 x research source 10 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source 11 x research source get the appropriate foods food is the body s fuel supplying the energy needed to generate heat when a person s body is exposed to freezing temperatures over half of the calories consumed go toward maintaining a normal body temperature thus the colder it is the more food people need in normal temperatures an adequately hydrated person can survive without food from 1 6 weeks depending on a number of factors in freezing temperatures that number tops out at about 3 weeks given that the average american eats about 2 300 calories per day half of which would be stripped away to regulate body temperature while trapped in a vehicle minimally each person should eat about 3 500 calories per day that is a quite a bit of food for a family of five over the course of 72 hours to make it all fit in your cooler buy dense non perishable high calorie foods such as granola bars beef jerky nuts trail mix canned fruits and chocolate 12 x research source 13 x research source 14 x research source 15 x research source scale down according to your needs most individuals caught in a blizzard will not be stuck for days unless you are going to be in a very remote area you do not need to prepare many days worth of rations in reasonably well settled areas you can likely expect help to reach you in hours and not days therefore you may want to consider having the equivalent of a solid snack these are often stowed in the glove compartment of the vehicle in snowy climates make sure this item is shelf stable and not likely to perish anytime soon this food should likely not be a favorite of yours as you will likely be tempted to eat it and not replace it when an emergency arises do not store water in glove compartment as if the water bottle breaks it will likely ruin your registration insurance card maps service records and so on the trunk is usually better if you are diabetic be very sure to have a snack available gather the rest of your supplies you ll need to collect a number of items to dig your vehicle out of the snow if needed to assist others in helping to locate you to be attuned to weather and road conditions to take care of basic needs if trapped and to improvise and fix unanticipated problems once you ve collected your supplies listed below put them in your storage tub regularly check to make sure everything is in good shape and working flares to indicate your location to rescuers a piece of bright red material about 1 by 4 feet in size a wind up or transistor radio with several spare batteries so you can keep tabs on the weather and road conditions also for entertainment as boredom tends to cause people to do unwise things flashlights with very bright bulbs and plenty of batteries to use at night and to use in signaling for help jumper cables which you may need when the storm passes and your vehicle s battery has died a collapsible preferably metal snow shovel tow rope to either a help get your vehicle unstuck or b tie one end to the vehicle and the other to a person s waist if it s absolutely necessary for someone to leave the vehicle during the storm a compass a bag of sand salt or cat litter to give your tires traction if stuck a long handled ice scraper with a brush a tool kit for any surprises a pocket knife with a can opener a wind up watch to keep track of time a first aid kit an emergency supply of medicine for each person for 72 hours one pair of tall waterproof boots for the driver of the vehicle tissue paper paper towels and garbage bags for sanitary purposes feminine products and baby formula diapers and wipes if necessary 16 x research source 17 x research source watch the weather if a storm is approaching and you don t need to leave stay put make sure you understand the difference between winter storm watches and warnings a winter storm watch indicates there s a 50 80 chance that a considerable amount of sleet snow ice or a combination of two or more will affect a certain area a winter storm warning means there s at least an 80 chance that one or more are on their way to a certain area a blizzard warning or watch signals that significant amounts of falling snow and strong winds of at least 35 mph 56 3 km h that will reduce visibility to less than ¼ of a mile are highly likely or expected in the next 12 72 hours remember while you may feel confident driving in blustery weather plenty of people you re sharing the road with are less experienced and mother nature hits even the most seasoned drivers with unexpected surprises if you plan to drive in potentially hazardous conditions always let a trusted friend or family member know of your plans and route 18 x research source 19 x research source 20 x research source unclog snow from your vehicle s exhaust pipe first if stuck if you find yourself stuck and try to dislodge your vehicle to leave you first need to turn off your vehicle and make sure your exhaust pipe isn t clogged with snow if it is clogged your vehicle can quickly fill up with poisonous carbon monoxide to unclog it turn off your engine put on gloves and dig out as much snow as possible if you don t have gloves use a branch or something similar 21 x research source remove snow and ice from and around your vehicle it you ve been stuck for awhile and decide to try to get your vehicle out start removing snow from the roof of your vehicle and work your way down while you re doing this turn on the engine and defrost to start melting any ice on your front and back windshields next take a shovel and remove as much snow as possible around the tires and the sides of your vehicle try to also dig a path in the direction you want your vehicle to go scrape your windshields last if you don t have a traditional scraper use a credit card or cd case to help remove ice that hasn t already thawed if you don t have an ice scraper with a brush to remove the snow from your car use the branch of an evergreen tree or a newspaper whatever you can find to sweep it off if you don t have a shovel use what s available to you such as a hubcap or a frisbee in the trunk 22 x research source 23 x research source rock and roll your vehicle to get your car unstuck turn your wheels side to side a couple of times to push any remaining snow out of the way if you have all wheel or 4 wheel drive make sure it s engaged shift into forward or the lowest gear possible on a standard gently press the gas and ease forward even a couple of inches is good then shift into reverse and gently press the gas to rock backward repeat this process until you hopefully get enough traction to pull out and keep going if your tires start spinning let up on the gas immediately because you ll only dig yourself in deeper by spinning the tires have a passenger stand outside the vehicle hold onto the inside of the driver s window and help push never let anyone stand behind the vehicle and push because the car could slide back and cause serious injury if you don t get anywhere with this look for traction elsewhere if you have cat litter salt or sand spread some around either your front or back tires depending upon whether you have a front wheel or rear wheel drive vehicle if it s an all wheel or 4 wheel drive vehicle spread it by all four tires if you don t have these materials use your car mats small rocks or pebbles pine combs twigs or small branches as traction 24 x research source 25 x research source escape early if you re able if a snowstorm is just beginning and you are unable to dislodge your vehicle try to get help by flagging other drivers and by calling authorities the situation will likely only get worse keep in mind however that distances are greatly distorted by blowing snow what seems near is often much further away thus leaving your vehicle is only advised if help is assured and in clear and certain sight otherwise you have a much higher chance of surviving the storm by using your vehicle as your shelter stay with your vehicle it may be tempting to try to get out of your situation by walking out but if you are in an area without a lot of human development this is often a poor decision the one exception by staying with the car you are in physical danger such as if it catches on fire or may go into a body of water a car is pretty good shelter and unless there is obviously better options in short distance such as a house barn or store remember that distances become distorted by falling and blowing snow additionally snow covers holes sharp objects and other hazardous objects so heading out on foot is a serious risk in the midst of a storm 26 x research source 27 x research source 28 x research source notify authorities with your cellphone typically most people now have a cellphone that they carry with them at all times before your cellphone s battery dies pinpoint your precise location using your vehicle or phone s gps call 911 and tell them where you are stuck and who is in the vehicle make sure to also include other relevant information such as how much water and food you have how much gas you have and if someone in the vehicle has a serious medical condition 29 x research source if you have enough charge left in your phone make one short phone call to someone you think is not also stuck and who will advocate on your behalf with authorities to ensure you are rescued if it comes to that make sure you tell them your location use your phone s charge wisely if you are in your car for days you may have to turn off your cellphone when you are done to save any remaining battery charge for later emergency use but turning it off also means you will not get any incoming calls or texts if you turn on your vehicle periodically you can also charge your phone as it takes relatively little drain on the battery make yourself visible to rescuers when a major storm hits sometimes thousands of people can no longer get anywhere in their vehicles some choose to abandon their vehicles others stay since emergency personnel will make rescuing people occupied cars their priority you need to make it clear that you are still in your vehicle first put on your tall waterproof boots over your pants and put on a hat scarf gloves and heavy coat so you don t get wet which you want to avoid at all costs if possible getting wet in freezing temperatures will drop your body temperature quickly and put you at risk of hypothermia tie the red piece of fabric to your vehicle s antenna as a sign to rescuers if you don t have an antenna find a spot high on your vehicle where it can blow in the wind or tie it to the door handle facing the direction from which help is most likely to arrive if you don t have a red piece of fabric find something in your vehicle to use responders will recognize this as a sign that you re in need of assistance if stranded in a remote area stomp out help or sos very largely in the snow to make yourself visible to those searching by air if you have access to sticks or tree branches use them to fill in your letters you may need to do this again when it stops snowing honk your horn using morse code for sos but only when your vehicle is running to conserve your battery do three short honks three long honks three short honks pause for 10 15 seconds and repeat raise the hood of your vehicle after the snow has stopped falling to indicate to rescuers that you need help take turns staying awake to be on the lookout for help 30 x research source 31 x research source 32 x research source clear the exhaust pipe regularly even if you ve already unclogged your exhaust pipe while trying to get your vehicle unstuck you ll need to do it more than once if it continues to snow and you are able to periodically run your vehicle s engine carbon monoxide poisoning can make a person sick or cause a person to die through both prolonged and shorter but intense periods of exposure the early symptoms are nausea headaches and dizziness 33 x research source 34 x research source 35 x research source use gas sparingly the length of time you might be trapped in your vehicle depends upon a number of factors such as the severity of the storm where you re located the capabilities of emergency responders and how many others are stranded it s extremely important therefore to use your vehicle s gas as little as possible if help does not arrive and you are in a remote area you may need gas to evacuate when the storm passes if you have a relatively full tank of gas run the engine every hour for 10 minutes while you re doing this crack one window to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning if you don t have much gas only run your engine 1 2 times per day for 10 minutes so your battery doesn t die and your fuel line doesn t freeze use the sun s heat to your advantage in this instance and run your engine at night which will also help warm you 36 x research source 37 x research source use energy wisely you ll have a limited amount of energy and will need to balance your needs with your supply your primary source of energy will be your vehicle s gas which then provides the energy for your interior lights headlights flashers etc if prepared you ll also have flashlights matches candles batteries and a radio to conserve use one possibly two energy sources at a time for example don t use a flashlight while a candle is lit to melt snow for water make sure you always turn off anything using a battery after you re done with it pull out the clothes and blankets to preserve the heat your body produces you want to layer up as much as possible trapping in the heat ideally each person will have an extra dry layer of clothes and socks to put under a warm coat with a hat scarf and gloves if not tuck your socks into your pants and your shirt into your gloves if you have them trap in heat however you can if you have a knife or another instrument like a screwdriver sharp pen or a piece of plastic or metal ripped from your car cut the cloth from your seats floorboard or roof and wrap up in it for insulation utilize the floor mats however you can too crumble up and put road maps paperwork from your glove compartment newspaper paper towels or napkins etc under your clothes for insulation use the wool blankets you stocked up on to warm yourself ration your hand warmers but use them strategically put them in your gloves and pockets when needed but also put them in your socks under your hat by your ears and so forth 38 x research source block off unused space and insulate windows remember your vehicle is your shelter or home just as you insulate your home to protect you from winter weather and close the doors in your den when you get a roaring fire going you want to keep the cold out and keep the heat in your vehicle first reducing the size of the space inside your vehicle will help with this if you have an extra blanket and a large suv for example tape the blanket from the roof down behind the backseat to seal off the area behind it tape newspaper to the windows to insulate them if you don t have a blanket to block unused space use whatever material is at your disposal you could cut out the seat cushions for example and lodge them in strategic locations to reduce the space in your vehicle if you don t have newspaper to insulate the windows look around you do you have magazines paper towels or napkins your child s textbook you could also use the floor mats if you don t have tape do you have band aids gum nail glue seek warmth from another person s body heat if you re not alone the person next to you is far warmer than anything around he or she may be madly shivering but 97 or 98 degrees is still dozens of degrees higher than everything around you and together particularly in smaller spaces you can actually increase the amount of heat in that area by huddling together create a cocoon around yourselves with your blankets coats or whatever it is you ve found to stay warm move your body movement increases your circulation which creates energy that helps keep you warm in fact your body puts out 5 10 times more heat when it s actively exerting itself in a situation such as this particularly if you don t have food to replenish your system too much exercise is both impractical and unwise nonetheless you still need to keep moving some when you re sitting move your hands and feet in circles flex your fingers and toes and do arm and leg stretches 39 x research source ration your food and water supplies you need to drink about 5 ounces of fluids an hour to avoid dehydration that s roughly equivalent to filling a standard coffee mug half full or about one third of a water bottle you should also eat a small snack every hour or so to help supply your body with energy to produce heat use your watch rather than your cellphone or a clock in your vehicle that relies on your vehicle s battery to keep track of the time if you don t have a watch try to gauge the time by observing the sun as it moves through the sky avoid caffeine and alcohol they both in their own ways speed up the bad effects cold weather has on your body even if one or the other may seem to help your goal is to regulate your body s temperature fluid levels and blood sugar levels as much as possible and to make your supplies last melt snow to make water because you have a limited number of water bottles or do not have fluids at all you ll need to melt snow first however never eat snow no matter how thirsty you are it can lower your body temperature to dangerous levels if you ve prepared in advance you have a coffee can waterproof matches and a couple of candles to melt snow fill the can loosely about ½ to ¾ full and light either a couple of matches or a candle to hold underneath the can don t pack the snow into the can make sure to crack a window while you re doing this because even small candles and matches can produce carbon monoxide if you don t have these supplies look around you what s metal or plastic that can be emptied or pried apart and used to collect and put snow in such as a plastic bag from the grocery store or even your glove compartment when you turn your vehicle on direct the vents toward the snow to melt it if you re out of gas put smaller amounts of snow in your container and set it in the sun or a warmer spot in the car to melt store your water properly water bottles can be stored in your cooler if you don t have a cooler but do have bottles wrap them in a blanket or another kind of material for insulation extra melted snow can be stored in empty water bottles or whatever you have on hand if your water gets too slushy place it in the sun or near a heating vent when you turn on the engine you can also store water in an airtight container and bury it about a foot beneath the snow even when the air above ground is freezing the air trapped in the snow provides insulation and will help prevent the water from freezing find food where you can remember you can survive in freezing temperatures without food for up to three weeks as long as you re adequately hydrated and have proper shelter it won t be fun but you can only survive three hours in freezing temperatures without shelter check your vehicle thoroughly for food you might not think you have such as an old breakfast bar that might have become stuck between the seats or sugar packets you might have in your purse from lunch last week if you find something don t devour it no matter how hungry you are eat only a small amount at a time and chew it slowly this will make it feel as if you ve eaten more if you suspect someone with you has hypothermia and isn t thinking clearly take extra precautions if he or she is also hungry don t let them leave the vehicle in search of food determine the road conditions if you re still stranded when the storm clears you ll need to make a decision about when and how you will leave much of this will depend upon your location how long you ve been trapped and how well you re doing physically if you have a wind up or transistor radio or enough gas left to listen to the radio try to determine the road conditions and if certain roads are blocked talk to others if you ve been stranded on a highway for instance if you still have charge on your cellphone call a friend or relative to seek assistance and to ask what s being done to clear the roads and or find you 40 x research source decide whether to leave if stranded near others if you re in a city or on a highway where others are stranded you have a high chance of being rescued once the weather settles and emergency personnel are able to maneuver more easily nonetheless if there are a lot of people also stranded it could take a long time time you may not have if you decide to walk in search of safety go with others if possible leave a note in your vehicle stating where you are going and stick to the plan so rescuers or loved ones will be able to find you if they locate your vehicle first wear multiple layers and bring as many supplies as you can without becoming overloaded if you have enough gas left and think you can avoid becoming stuck again try to dislodge your vehicle if you choose to stay with your vehicle make sure it s obvious to rescuers that you are still with your vehicle choose to stay or go if in a remote area very cold weather puts added strain on a person s heart and activities like shoveling snow pushing a car and trudging through snow covered terrain for long distances can cause heart attacks or make other health conditions considerably worse if you re in a remote area are in relatively good health and believe you have enough gas to reach a gas station a hotel or the like consider digging your vehicle out of the snow if you don t have enough gas you will need to make a choice attempt to walk to safety or do everything you can to make yourself visible to rescuers if you stay stamp out sos in the snow again and lay branches in the letters use a cd or break off one of the mirrors from your car to sweep the horizon frequently this will bounce off the sun and air rescuers will recognize it as a signal if you can get a fire started now that the snow has stopped start one and keep it going particularly at night for warmth and to signal rescuers 41 x research source if you decide to walk leave a note indicating where you re headed and again stick to the plan layer up bring as many of your supplies with you as possible make sure you leave in the early morning and take frequent breaks to rest and to drink and eat something 42 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to be safe during a hurricane,hurricanes are severe storms that have the potential to cause catastrophic damage while we can t stop hurricanes from hitting careful preparation and planning can help you get through the storm safely whether you live in a hurricane prone area or somewhere they only hit occasionally there are a number of precautions you can take to keep yourself and your family safe during and after the storm,learn about the area you live in you should find out if you re living in an evacuation area usually areas close to water will be evacuated during severe storms so you should find out if you area is one of these that way when severe storm warnings come in you can be prepared to evacuate if necessary 1 x research source find out if there are any evacuation shelters near your home mark them on a map so you know where to go if you re forced to leave your home also pay attention to the topography around your home if you live at the bottom of a hill water will flow down towards your house this means that your property is flood prone and you should take extra precautions if a storm is approaching sand bags around your home for instance could help reduce the chances of flooding locate high ground in your neighborhood so you have a place to flee in case your home floods stock your home with food and water in the event of a severe storm you could be cut off from food for a few days if the area loses power local supermarkets won t be able to open to prepare the cdc recommends that you stock your home with at least 3 to 5 days worth of food and water per person 2 x research source get food that doesn t go bad like canned items this way if you lose power your food won t spoil it is also helpful because you can buy non perishable items at the beginning of the hurricane season and not worry about having to replace them until at least the next year five gallons of water per person should be enough to last 3 to 5 days gather other necessary supplies in addition to food and water the cdc checklist recommends several other items you should have in your home they include but are not limited to 3 x research source medical supplies like a first aid kit and any prescription medicines you are taking a battery operated radio in case you lose power a flashlight extra batteries for all your devices extra blankets personal care items like soap toothpaste and cleaning wipes in case you don t have access to water a fire extinguisher put together an emergency car kit it possible that you ll be ordered to evacuate your home or be forced to leave in the event of sudden flooding to prepare for this you should also have supplies stocked for your car the cdc recommends the following items to ensure your health and safety if you re forced to drive in the storm 4 x research source non perishable food and water emergency flares jumper cables first aid kit blankets flashlights and extra batteries a map you could also mark evacuation shelters or other safe places you could go if forced to leave your home on this map a gps navigator make an emergency plan in the event of a hurricane it is very important for you and everyone in your house to have a plan of action review this plan periodically so everyone in your house is familiar with it if you have children it might be helpful to hold drills a few times a year so they can practice things like packing and getting into the car quickly some things you should include in your plan are 5 x research source decide at what point you will leave your home just because an area wasn t ordered to evacuate doesn t mean that you won t still have to leave your home a serious storm can send surges of water that will flood homes far from the coast a list of locations you can stay if you re forced to leave your home how you ll communicate with other members of your family if you leave your home if you have pets you need to plan what you will do with them if you re forced to leave your home install a generator high winds from hurricanes can easily knock out power if possible you should install a generator in the event of a power loss this will keep your food fresh your home lit and your telephones working 6 x research source if your generator is gasoline operated be sure to keep an extra supply on hand if your generator isn t programmed to turn on automatically when the power goes out make sure you put it in a location you can easily reach during the storm never locate a generator indoors most run on gasoline which produces carbon monoxide if you run a generator indoors you will poison yourself take photos of your home and store them in a safe waterproof place if your home is damaged during the hurricane you ll have to put in an insurance claim to recover your losses

way to a central room and stay there 2 x research source if you re planning for a nuclear war weeks or months in advance make a plan regarding how you ll get yourself to a large secure building within 5 minutes of a bomb warning make your way to an underground basement or ground floor if it s possible move as low as possible within the building preferably try to find a room without any exterior windows or doors stand or sit in the middle of the room and wait for the bomb to hit 3 x research source locating yourself away from exterior windows and walls will decrease the amount of radiation you receive remain inside for at least 30 minutes following the blast if the building that you re in remains standing after the bomb blast hits it don t go outside right away a large wave of radiation will sweep outward from the bomb location this radioactive fallout will take several minutes to arrive at your location so stay indoors preferably still underground where you ll be relatively safe from the radiation 4 x research source if you step out within the first few minutes after the blast the radiation wave is likely to kill you stay in the shelter for 24 hours to avoid the worst of the fallout this may not be practical in some situations e g if the building was partially destroyed and is no longer safe while you must stay inside for 30 minutes after the blast after that time has passed you can quickly relocate yourself to a larger sturdier building if there s one within 1 4 mile 0 40 km again seek out a central room or basement away from windows 5 x research source once you re in a safe sturdy building stay there for up to 24 hours listen for official instructions regarding when and how to evacuate use a radio set a television or your cell phone to check official news

a nuclear war in the case of a large scale nuclear war public water reservoirs and other supplies would become contaminated with radiation to avoid drinking radiated water you ll need to have a large private supply over a period of several months purchase or bottle at home at least 300 gallons 1 100 l of clean water per person in your household 12 x research source depending on how much water you and your family members use for showering and cleaning purposes this amount should last about 250 days purchase several months worth of packaged food any crops and animals struck by radiation will either die or be completely irradiated and any food derived from them will be irradiated as well even if you re not concerned about irradiated food there s a good chance that the majority of existing food supplies will be destroyed in a nuclear war to prepare visit your local supermarket regularly and stock up on packaged and non perishable foods 13 x research source these include things like cans of tuna soup and chili canned vegetables sealed packages of frozen meat sealed bags of chips pretzels and other snacks seal windows and doors by taping plastic up over them if you re at home and concerned about nuclear blasts or if there s already a nuclear war going on cut apart several large plastic garbage bags use masking tape to tape the plastic bags up on the inside of your home s windows taping plastic on the inside of the windows will protect you should an air blast from an atomic bomb shatter the glass and send shards flying inward 14 x research source taping up plastic will also provide some limited protection from fallout after a nuclear blast turn off your home s ac unit as soon as a nuclear strike occurs air conditioning units and other forms of home ventilation bring air into the home from the outside if a nuclear strike has occurred within 1 2 miles 1 6 3 2 km of your home the outside air will be irradiated to keep this air from being pulled into your home turn

communicate chances are that all of the members of your family won t be in 1 location when a nuclear strike occurs or a nuclear war breaks out this will be especially true if you have kids so plan a communication strategy and family meet up location well in advance this will allow everyone to reunite as soon as possible 16 x research source for example you could all agree to meet at a large public building like a courthouse or library cell phones may be unreliable after a nuclear blast instead you could give each member of your family a battery powered walkie talkie to use for communicating stock up on essential medications in preparation for a nuclear war if a nuclear war were to break out tomorrow it would become difficult or impossible to refill medical prescriptions if

know as well as you can that the shooter is inside retrace your steps mentally to the nearest school exit when you get a free moment in class challenge yourself to think of the quickest route off campus from your current location figure this out for each of your classes so you can be prepared just in case you need to make a quick getaway do the same thing for anywhere else that you spend a lot of time on campus such as the cafeteria gym or sports fields find shortcuts and alternate routes around your school challenge yourself to take different routes to class and to explore areas of campus that you re not as familiar with find the fastest way out from every area on campus as well as alternate routes in case some ways are blocked off or inaccessible look around campus after school or during lunch when you re allowed to be out and about in the unlikely event of a shooting threat your in depth knowledge of your school can help you make a quick getaway review these routes with yourself every once in a while once you ve set up your own mental evacuation routes go over them in your head every few days to keep them fresh your goal is to turn these routes into an instinct so that you know how to evacuate in case it ever becomes necessary take the school s evacuation procedures into account your school probably has its own evacuation routes in place for the unlikely event of a shooting if you haven t already learned these routes through drills you can ask a teacher or administrator what they are remember that in a school shooting situation you likely won t be on your own you can follow the lead of teachers and other adults who are trained to take care of you in these situations if you somehow do find yourself separated from the group your own evacuation preparation is your backup you can use what you know to make a safe escape note large strong objects you can hide behind in a classroom in a lockdown situation where you re sheltering in a classroom you can protect yourself even more by hiding behind solid objects look around your classrooms and note thick tables that you might be able to turn over and crouch behind or large cabinets you could hide behind 2 x research source avoid hiding behind objects made of plastic like bathroom doors or thin materials like cabinet doors if you do find yourself hiding in a classroom stay on your hands and knees try not to let any vital organs touch the floor like your heart or lungs just in case the shooter comes in bullets tend to ricochet along the path of the floor so anything on the floor is at risk ask a teacher if you can practice barricading a door if you can impede the shooter s access to your room there s a good chance they ll move on take note of large objects you can use to block the door like desks tables or movable cabinets 3 x research source you can also wind and secure a belt around the door knob then pull it tight to prevent the shooter from opening the door only do this if you or the teacher can stand to the side of the door to pull the belt taut practice moving tables against the door or holding the knob with a belt when you re at home or also ask a teacher if you can practice in their classroom after class remember that in a school shooting situation you ll likely have other classmates and teachers to help you secure the door identify good places to take shelter if you re in the hallways or outside there are many outdoor areas where you could hide in the unlikely event of a school shooting as you re walking to class look around for a couple of good hiding spots take note of areas outside of the school as well 4 x research source if you re in the hallways you could shelter in a nearby classroom or janitorial closet avoid hiding in a restroom as bathroom stalls provide very little protection don t typically have windows if you re outside try hiding behind a large tree a concrete building or pillar or a car hide near the front of the car as the engine will stop bullets while the trunk will not identify classroom objects you could use to defend yourself there are many everyday classroom items that you can use as defense weapons in case of an extreme emergency noticing things in your classroom that you can easily grab and throw will make you feel more prepared and safe in case of a shooting 5 x research source good objects to use to impede a shooter include heavy textbooks fire extinguishers and backpacks if a shooter is entering your classroom you can throw these objects at them to distract them and throw them off balance giving you a window to escape take self defense classes if you can it s very unlikely that you ll ever have to fight off a shooter but if you want to feel even more prepared try a few self defense classes sign up for classes as your local gym or community center looking in particular for courses that show you how to defend yourself against a shooter listen carefully in class and take the lessons seriously work hard to perfect your skills until they re second nature so that you feel safe and confident in case of a dangerous situation remember that you should only try to fight or disarm the shooter if you re an adult or older teenager or if you truly have no other option as you may be putting yourself in the line of fire know your general options of run hide or fight in the unlikely case of a high stress emergency situation this short mantra can quickly remind you of your options run means evacuate hide means shelter and fight means fight off the shooter as a last resort no one option is considered best it all depends on your situation 6 x research source for example if you don t have a safe escape route you shouldn t try to evacuate instead hide somewhere that the shooter can t see you if you ever feel scared that a shooting could happen at your school remember first how unlikely it is then recall that you have a plan just in case it does happen stay alert when you re at school just in case it s easy to zone out when you re at school but you should always try to stay awake and engaged there s only the smallest chance that a shooting will happen at your school but if it does staying alert will help you realize what s going on and take it seriously 7 x research source make sure you get good sleep on weekdays so that you can be alert through the whole school day aim for at least 9 hours of sleep a night 8 x research source leave the classroom cautiously during fire drills some shooters have pulled fire alarms to bring students and teachers out of classroom and cause chaos before beginning to shoot to be prepared just in case this attack occurs stay on alert during a drill and stay near your teacher and classmates 9 x research source don t chat too much with friends while you re walking out of the classroom remember that you need to be able to hear the teacher and what s happening around you in case of emergency in case you do hear a shooting happening during a fire drill be prepared to backtrack to a classroom and barricade the door if you re already outside remember to duck behind a solid object create an emergency communication plan with your family talk with your parents or guardian about how you might get in touch with them during an emergency at school talk about different scenarios such as what you ll do if you lose track of your phone or are locked down in a classroom and can t make noise 10 x research source ask them not to call you in this kind of situation since you ll be staying quiet try texting instead think about a plan of action if you lose your phone during an emergency you could get in touch with them from a classmate s phone or arrange to meet them at a certain spot remember to be realistic when talking with your parents you likely won t ever be in a shooting situation at school but it s good to have these backup plans in place just in case practice staying calm in stressful situations although it s unlikely that you ll be in a situation as extreme as a school shooting you can practice staying calm in scenarios that are less stressful when you start to feel panicky take deep breaths and focus on relaxing your muscles even if it feels impossible you can practice staying calm in situations like getting lost while driving or confronting someone who s angry or upset notice your body s physical reactions to stress your heart might race for example or you might feel dizzy recognizing these distracting reactions and learning to overcome them is invaluable in an emergency situation be ready to think on your feet even with all your best preparations it s impossible to know what actions will be best during a school shooting don t let this scare you instead resolve to be calm and resourceful if the situation ever strikes 11 x research source use your best instincts to get yourself out of danger trust yourself there won t be time for second guessing and decisive action is better than hesitation don t rely too heavily on one course of action review all your possible options regularly and be open to other solutions if the moment demands it talk to a school administrator about creating a shooting plan of action ask a teacher or administrator if your school has a plan in place for an active shooter situation if it doesn t ask what you can do to help create one this could involve researching plans on the internet or getting in touch with law enforcement to construct a new plan if your administration seems disinterested don t give up remind them that school shootings can happen everywhere and that your school is no different talk about having more than a lockdown plan if your school relies on a lockdown plan teachers locking their doors and keeping students inside until the all clear has been called ask about supplementing this with other plans you could suggest a safe quiet evacuation plan or even school wide courses on basic self defense 12 x research source look online to find programs that provide alternate school shooting training to faculty and students show your research to your school s administration to offer other options ask about inviting speakers or police officers to talk to students police officers and public safety departments often do presentations on the best way to respond to emergency situations ask your administration about inviting them to speak to your school or faculty about revamping school shooting procedures 13 x research source suggest holding active shooter drills to show everyone what to do many schools now hold active shooter drills that like fire or tornado drills teach students and faculty what to do in an emergency situation ask your counselors or principal about holding lockdown or evacuation drills every few months although your school administration might not like taking away from class time they know that it s important to be prepared for this unlikely but dangerous situation,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a chemical or biological attack,biological and chemical weapons may be the most devastating and uncontrollable weapons ever rendered by man biological weapons are any man made weapon caused to disperse viruses bacteria or toxins derived from living organisms to cause death or disease within humans recent statistics claim that in the event of a future terrorist attack the means in which the attack would be achieved would be through the use of bio chemical weapons due to the nature of biological and chemical weapons the most widely predicted use for such weapons would be against the populace of a nation where it may inflict massive fatalities and economic destruction however this does not mean that a bio chemical attack is un survivable with proper knowledge and readiness it can very well be a crisis that one can overcome,don t count on a vaccine being available the flu vaccine that is currently used for seasonal flu will not work against any chemical or biological attack new strains of the virus require new vaccines and these can take months or years to develop and even longer to produce and distribute on a large scale stay informed should a pandemic of any kind flare up the world health organization who the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and other governmental and non governmental organizations will provide information on the spread of the disease as well as updates on vaccines or other medications tips for keeping yourself safe and travel advisories the who and cdc as well as various national governments already have websites in place to provide useful planning information to the public newspapers and tv and radio broadcasts will also help disseminate critical warnings and advice get your yearly flu vaccine shot while the current vaccine won t protect you from every flu or any other new strains of the virus it can help you stay healthy by protecting you some flu virus strains which may in turn help your body to fight the virus better if you do become infected get a pneumonia vaccine shot in past chemical or biological pandemics many victims succumbed to secondary pneumonia infection while the pneumonia vaccine cannot protect against all types of pneumonia it can improve your chances of surviving the pandemic the vaccine is especially recommended for people over the age of 65 or those who have chronic illnesses such as diabetes or asthma use anti viral medications if advised to do so by a health professional or by the government two antiviral medications tamiflu and relenza have shown the potential to effectively prevent and treat avian flu these are both available only by prescription and will probably be effective only if taken before infection or very shortly afterward it should be noted that additional testing is necessary to determine how effective these drugs really are against avian flu furthermore mutations in the avian flu virus may render them ineffective in time wash your hands frequently hand washing may be the single most powerful defense against avian influenza and many other infectious diseases if pandemic strikes you should wash your hands several times a day make sure that you use proper hand washing technique use an alcohol based disinfectant since it s probably not feasible to wash your hands every time you touch something that may carry the virus you should carry an alcohol based hand cleaner with you at all times these cleaners come in a variety of forms and can be used any time you need a quick touch up keep in mind however that the use of these cleaners is not a substitute for thoroughly washing your hands and they should only be used to supplement hand washing avoid exposure to infected right now the only documented way to become infected with avian influenza is by coming into contact with infected birds or poultry products and these routes of infection will continue even if the virus mutates so that human to human transmission becomes the greatest threat avoid handling any thing the infected has already touched and try to prevent domestic animals such as house cats dogs from coming into contact with infected if you work in proximity the dead or living infected for example take precautions such as wearing gloves respirators and safety aprons cook all foods thoroughly to 165 f 74 c throughout and exercise proper food handling techniques as you would to protect yourself from other threats such as salmonella proper cooking kills the most virus exercise social distancing the most effective way to prevent becoming infected is to avoid exposure to infected people unfortunately it s not possible to determine who is infected and who is not by the time symptoms appear a person is already contagious social distancing deliberately limiting contact with people especially large groups of people is a reasonable precaution to take in the event of a pandemic stay home from work if you re sick or if others at your workplace have become sick you should stay away from your workplace even in the absence of a pandemic given that people will generally be infected and contagious before they exhibit symptoms however during a pandemic it s essential to stay away from places such as work where you have a high probability of being exposed to an infected person try to work from home a pandemic can last for months or even years and waves of intense local outbreaks can last for weeks so it s not like you can just take a few sick days to protect yourself from workplace infection if possible try to arrange a work from home situation a surprising variety of jobs can now be accomplished remotely and employers will likely be willing or even required to try this out if a pandemic strikes keep children home from school any parent knows that kids pick up all kinds of bugs at school avoid public transportation buses planes boats and trains place large numbers of people in close quarters public transportation is the ideal vehicle for widespread spread of infectious disease stay away from public events during a pandemic governments may cancel public events but even if they don t you should probably stay away from them any large gathering of people in close proximity creates a high risk situation wear a respirator the most virus can be spread through the air so in the event of a pandemic it s a good idea to protect yourself from inhalation of the virus if you re out in public while surgical masks only prevent the wearer from spreading germs respirators which often look like surgical masks protect the wearer from inhaling germs you can buy respirators that are designed for one time use or you can buy reusable ones with replaceable filters use only respirators labeled as niosh certified n95 n99 or n100 as these help protect against inhalation of very small particles respirators only provide protection when worn properly so be sure to follow the instructions exactly they should cover the nose and there should be no gaps between the mask and the side of the face wear medical gloves gloves can prevent germs from getting on your hands where they can be absorbed directly through open cuts or spread to other parts of your body latex or nitrile medical gloves or heavy duty rubber gloves can be used to protect the hands the gloves should be removed if torn or damaged and hands should be thoroughly washed after removal of gloves protect your eyes some illnesses can be spread if contaminated droplets from a sneeze or spit for example and then enter the eyes or mouth wear glasses or goggles to prevent this from occurring and avoid touching your eyes or mouth with your hands or with potentially contaminated materials dispose of potentially contaminated materials properly gloves masks tissues and other potential bio hazards should be handled carefully and disposed of properly place these materials in approved bio hazard containers or seal them in clearly marked plastic bags prepare for disruption of services if a pandemic strikes many of the basic services we take for granted such as electricity phone and mass transit may be disrupted temporarily widespread employee absenteeism and massive death tolls can shut down everything from the corner store to hospitals keep a small amount of cash around at all times in such situations banks may close and atms may be out of service discuss emergency preparation with your family make a plan so that children will know what to do and where to go if you are incapacitated or killed or if family members cannot communicate with each other stock up on necessities in the developed world at least food shortages and disruption of services will likely not last more than a week or two at a time still it s essential to be prepared for such an event store a two week supply of water for everyone in your household keep at least 1 gallon 3 8 l per person per day in clear plastic containers store a two week supply of food opt for non perishable foods that don t need to be cooked and that don t require a lot of water to prepare stock up on your medications make sure you have an adequate supply of essential medications seek medical attention at the onset of symptoms the effectiveness of antiviral medications decreases as the illness progresses so prompt medical treatment is imperative if someone with whom you have had close contact becomes infected be sure to seek medical care even if you do not display symptoms,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare your home for a hurricane,a hurricane is a severe tropical cyclone every year an average of 11 tropical storms occur and 6 of these become hurricanes a hurricane often causes devastating damage to coastlines and can travel hundreds of miles inland if you live near the atlantic ocean the caribbean sea the gulf of mexico or another area with frequent tropical storms you need to know how to prepare your home for a hurricane,know whether your home is in a flood zone area if you live in a flood zone consider investing in flood insurance your homeowner s policy usually won t cover damage caused by hurricane related floods make a complete list of all your possessions including outdoor items list lawn furniture patio umbrellas grills tools and toys this can help your insurance broker ensure you have enough insurance to replace any damaged items after a hurricane talk with your insurance broker about what you need to do to prepare for a hurricane in order for your policy to cover damage caused by a hurricane confirm that your hurricane shutters are in good condition if you do not have hurricane shutters consider installing them you can also replace your windows with hurricane glass both will provide protection from shattering glass during strong winds determine whether you need to replace your roof with a hip roof this style of roof has a 30 degree pitch or less on older homes retrofit existing roofs with hurricane straps gables and end brackets or braces check your gutters to be sure they are clear of leaves and other debris to prepare for hurricanes clean gutters can prevent damage to your home during long periods of heavy rain remove dead or damaged trees especially those near the house pick up and dispose of all limbs sticks and other debris on or near your property items like these can become airborne during high winds collect outdoor items from the yard and bring them inside when you hear a hurricane advisory these will become flying projectiles in the high winds and can get swept away by floodwaters if your house is near the coast put together supplies to prepare for hurricanes you won t always have time to buy items before a hurricane strikes especially when the storm is imminent so you ll want to store the necessary items in your home well in advance purchase or create a food kit this should include dried foods that you can rehydrate with bottled water and non perishable foods include a manual can opener and any other supplies you might want to use to prepare food in the event you lose power and access to supplies for an extended period of time prepare for hurricanes with a supply of drinking water you should have bottled water on hand some people will clean and rinse their bathtubs and fill them with tap water to use as additional drinking water during a hurricane store an extra set of clothes warm socks and a pair of shoes in a waterproof container for each family member these will come in handy if clothes are soiled or ruined due to floodwaters or debris move all valuables and paperwork to the upper floors of your home you may want to store these in waterproof containers or a safe as well collect items you may need have a radio that can work with battery power so you can monitor the storm and keep up with the latest hurricane advisories you may also want a first aid kit extra batteries and a flashlight determine the best place in your home to go during a hurricane you may need to modify an area of your home during your hurricane preparation others will be able to use an area in the home without windows that will be safe from flooding,Home-and-Garden
how to build a bomb shelter,building a bomb shelter is different from the construction of storm shelters fall out shelters and other structures in that it is built in anticipation of direct exposure to explosive ordinance this project requires special materials and construction practices and is not for a novice or hobbyist nevertheless here are steps to help you learn how to accomplish this task,develop a site plan for the location you plan on building your bomb shelter at to be successful on this project where failure could one might assume leave you dead requires a thorough survey of the site you choose 1 x research source here are some explanations why this is critical to success bomb shelters must be able to sustain minimal damage in a near miss or direct hit from exploding ordinance soft soil can offer only limited resistance to bomb energy so building in soft soil requires a deep excavation with highly reinforced construction in areas with poor drainage or a high water table the option of building deep will require more engineering than this page will offer building in solid rock unless you have a suitable cavern to use as a superstructure will require blasting and drilling which also will exceed the scope of this page building into the side of a mountain or steep hill is a good choice for people with the resources to do so and without the depth requirements the following steps are fairly typical of what needs to be done to successfully complete your bomb shelter project building on stable flat well drained land is the most direct approach to getting the job done and that will be what we assume the reader plans to do determine the critical factors to consider in your design basically there are four things to keep in mind while designing your shelter how many people will it house this will give you information needed to design the shelter in respect to size and accommodation since bomb shelters typical are very temporary in nature unless a sustained bombardment is anticipated you can expect to allow at least 72 square feet of space per person decide what ordinance your structure will need to resist a typical 500 pound bomb has a blast energy of about 10 000 feet per second using high explosives and if fused for a ground burst or impact detonation you will want a minimum of 15 feet of energy absorbing material between the ground and your structural roof bunker busters on the other hand can penetrate many feet the exact distance for obvious reasons is classified of reinforced concrete since 20 feet is a reasonable limit to excavate and redress we will assume our design on that depth other considerations are best left to experts hire a geotechnical firm to address drainage soil density excavation shoring requirements and other factors to ensure safe digging and building conditions with an excavation this deep shoring sheet pilings and other issues will require professional assistance so the following construction steps are general requirements for minimal performance hire a structural engineer for detailed construction plans if you are knowledgeable about concrete construction methods including load bearing cast in place concrete beams roofs and walls you could do this yourself however getting an expert is recommended talk with your local planning and zoning office to determine what permits and licenses your project will require most likely you will need engineered plans and a geotechnical report before a permit will be issued now that the technical issues have been addressed look further down for actual building instructions 2 x research source mark out your site erect silt fences erosion barriers and other controls needed to begin clearing and excavation clear sufficient land for your excavation spoil piles and haul storage areas for a 12x18 foot shelter you will want to clear about one acre of land for ancillary use grade the excavation area to a reasonably flat profile trying to dig a very deep hole on unlevel land is an invitation to disaster start digging your excavation about 150 feet from your actual shelter s footprint this is to allow an access ramp to be created and will give workment equipment access in later steps continue to build your ramp until you are below the finish floor grade of your shelter dig the bottom of the shelter pit about 4 feet wider than the outside wall dimensions you may use a load for this purpose but a large excavator in the 300 to 350 range and with an extended reach boom will give faster and more efficient production inspect the sides of the excavation often especially if you enter a different soil layer to make sure they are stable working in the bottom of a deep pit without cave in protection is illegal and foolish when unstable soil is encountered either use shoring systems or sheet piling to protect the workers dig until you reach the excavation requirements grade the bottom of your pit and compact the soil you may now want to rough in whatever utilities your shelter will require such as electrical power plumbing and a fresh air supply duct since these may be installed underneath your shelter foundation 3 x research source form up the foundation for your bomb shelter 4 x research source since the main structural element of the shelter will be the walls and especially the roof you will not need an very thick floor but the exterior walls will require a substantial foundation this can be placed in a monolithic slab making the floor itself about 8 inches thick and the wall foundations about 3 feet thick and 5 feet wide install the footing and slab reinforcement number 5 rebar on 8 inch centers the wall footings will need something like 8 number 8 rebar 4 top and bottom supported by number 4 rebar stirrups on 24 inch centers you will also want to provide 2 rows of dowels made from number 8 rebar on 12 inch centers spaced 10 inches apart these will require a minimum of 30 inches embedment and 6 feet of projection keep in mind these are general design requirements if your structural engineer requires more or different configurations he is the expert allow an opening on the end of the slab where your ramp enters your pit for a door your bomb shelter should be protected by a blast resistant reinforced concrete and steel laminated structural door and frame consulting a vault door manufacturer like mosler is probably a good idea place your concrete foundation and slab you will almost certainly require an aerial concrete pump for this part of the project choose one with sufficient boom and capacity to reach all sides of the slab without getting too near the excavation these special vehicles can have booms from 30 to 40 meters long and a pump hose 6 inches in diameter build or rent forms for your wall concrete placement you may use coil rods snap ties or other means to secure the forms along with whalers stiff backs and other shoring to keep your walls plumb and uniform in thickness you will want to go ahead and erect the inside forms to the finished ceiling height of the bomb shelter generally a minimum of 7 foot is required but 8 foot ceilings are considered standard install and tie the reinforcing bars for your walls the sides will be reinforced with number 8 rebar on twelve inch centers vertically two rows and number 6 rebar horizontal at 12 inch maximum centers on each row of vertical bars make sure to use corner bar reinforcement at all corners and lap bars at splices a minimum of 48 bar diameters build beam pockets if your ceiling roof span requires structural steel support beams refer to engineer s recommendations to allow these beams to be installed prior to building the roof set the exterior forms shore and align them and place the concrete for these the tensile strength of the concrete is up to you or a structural engineer but 4000 psi concrete is recommended the exterior forms should extend higher than the interior ceiling so they will act as a perimeter form for placing the concrete roof on your bunker depending on the blast energy calculation you made earlier decide on the thickness of the bunker roof since it will support the weight of tons of earth as well as resisting the bomb blast a minimum thickness of 2 feet is suggested dowel out rebar for the shelter roof from the wall forms a minimum to two mats of number 8 rebar at 10 inches on center is needed for roof spans greater than 16 feet increase the rebar size decrease the spacing and thicken the roof unless steel support beams and columns are used to offset the increase load you may also consider pouring lateral concrete support beams and even using high tensile pre stressed concrete slabs for the roof if it is in your budget pour your concrete walls using the same pump you hired for the floor pour make sure the concrete is slumped correctly and that you vibrate it to consolidate the materials while pouring using the services of a testing laboratory will help ensure the concrete reaches its required strength allow the concrete walls to set cure a minimum of 7 days before removing the forms you will want to leave the outside forms in place until the roof has been cast in place set up shoring for the roof forms you may choose to rent metal shoring systems from a form company but you will need to install a minimum of one 4x4 tee jack at 32 inch cents both ways with the top of the tee 1 inch below the form joist bottoms assuming you are using 2x6 pine joists for your form and the ceiling is 8 feet high your tee jacks will be 7 feet 5 inches tall install diagonal bracing to keep your tee jacks plumb and in line for the uninitiated a tee jack is a vertical post built from a 4x4 with a horizontal tee on top also usually a 4x4 finish fabricating and installing all of your tee jacks after your tee jacks are in place lay out your joists on 12 to 16 inch centers then deck the joists with either form panel metal sheeting preferred or a minimum 3 4 form ply sheeting install your rebar reinforcing on top of the platform you have built to act as your ceiling form you will have two or three mats of rebar minimum so tie your first mat of number 8 rebar on ten inch centers supporting it on rebar chairs sold for this purpose the support and tie of the second mat using standees to maintain the correct spacing between mats place the bomb shelter roof with concrete as with the walls higher strength concrete is required with a minimum yield of 4000 psi but a preferred design mix of 5000 psi or 850 flexural strength allow this concrete placement to cure for a minimum of 7 days before removing the shoring support system after 28 days the outside forms can be removed and backfilling can commence backfill around the wall perimeter in lifts using compaction equipment to ensure the soil is compacted in 8 to 12 inch lifts if you have installed an air supply duct underneath the slab you can backfill to the top otherwise you will want to install this duct work when you reach the elevation required backfill the excavation over the roof of the shelter carefully and avoid using heavy equipment directly over the top of it especially until the first four or five feet of fill has been installed and compacted do not backfill the access ramp yet as you will need to construct a tunnel entrance to allow access first construct an entrance to your bomb shelter you will need to create a tunnel at least 50 feet long to reach the door of your bomb shelter depending on the size of your door using a concrete pipe or structural tubing like asphalt coated galvanized steel pipe in 10 or 12 feet diameter is the most practical method since tunnel failure can turn your refuge into a tomb in short order care in choosing and constructing your entrance venue is just as important as designing and building the shelter itself finish constructing your entrance tunnel and backfilling the excavation restore the vegetation over the top connect the utilities and air supply ducts and you are finished,Home-and-Garden
how to make a disaster plan for your family,natural and man made disasters can strike at any time even with advance warning any disaster from a hurricane tornado or a nuclear accident can catch you off guard and put you in grave danger a little planning and practice before you re in danger can help you and your family survive even the worst disasters,determine what disasters are the most prevalent in your area if you live in kansas you don t need to prepare for a hurricane but you d better be ready for tornadoes while some disasters such as fire can happen anywhere the hazards you might encounter vary widely from place to place check with your local emergency management or civil defense office red cross chapter or the national weather service to get an idea of what emergencies you should prepare for find out what you should do in case a disaster strikes the organizations above will likely be able to advise you what to do in an emergency they may be able to provide you with evacuation maps and information about local warning systems and emergency plans if you can t get all the information you need from officials research your local hazards on your own figure out for example what preparations you should make for a tornado or hurricane and how to survive if you re caught in a disaster and determine the best evacuation routes on your own if need be remember when push comes to shove it s your responsibility to ensure your family is well prepared pick a meeting spot and a way to get in contact with your family members there s a good chance that all your family members won t be in the same place when disaster strikes so it s important to have a predetermined rendezvous point choose a spot that will likely be safe and that is well away from your neighborhood as you might not be able to make it back to your home designate a contact person to connect your family designate a friend or relative as a contact person that you your spouse and your children can call if you can t meet up in order to minimize the chance that the contact person will also be affected by the disaster choose someone who lives in a distant town or in a different state make sure that all your family members have the contact person s phone number with them at all times discuss disaster scenarios with your family and make sure everyone knows what to do in all the likely emergency scenarios it s important to educate yourself on how to respond to likely hazards but what happens to your family if they are away from you or if you re killed or injured it s not enough for one person in the family to know what to do everybody should know the plan fix potential hazards in your home once you ve identified potential disaster scenarios thoroughly inspect your house and try to make it as safe as possible here are just a few examples every home should have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers test smoke detectors at least once a month and replace their batteries yearly or as needed fire extinguishers should be recharged according to the manufacturer s instructions and family members should learn how to use them everyone should also know how to escape the house in the event of a fire if you live in an area prone to earthquakes you wouldn t want a tall heavy bookcase sitting right next to the baby s crib as it could be knocked over in a quake if you live near woods with the possibility of forest fires you should clear your property of brush and high grass to create a buffer zone between your home and the fire teach your family members basic life saving techniques everyone who can learn cpr and first aid should take a certification class and keep their certification current adults and older children should know how to turn off gas electricity and water if the house is damaged and everyone should know how to detect a gas leak emergency numbers should be posted near phones and even small children should be taught how to call 9 1 1 or the corresponding emergency number in your country practicing how to use a fire extinguisher and checking smoke detectors are great reminder exercises to do once a year have enough water to last you 10 to 30 days during an emergency situation such as an earthquake your house may lose access to water and you may not be able to get to the store to get more water during a flood you may be surrounded by water but that water will be unsanitary and unsafe to drink you also may not have access to drinking water plan on having one gallon 3 785 liters per person per day this includes drinking food preparation and sanitation water 1 x research source store your emergency water in clean non corrosive tightly sealed containers keep the containers in a cool dark place don t store them in sunlight or near gasoline kerosene pesticides and other similar substances 2 x research source assemble a disaster kit be prepared for emergencies with at least a three day supply of non perishable food and potable water and other things you might need if you have no utilities and no way to purchase supplies keep a smaller kit in the trunk of your car your kit should also include the following 3 x

against the shooter grab backpacks textbooks paperweights or whatever else you can find in the classroom give at least one thing to each person and explain that they should throw it at the shooter if they come in this may not seem like a great defense but even the slightest distraction might throw the shooter off and save lives it can also make your classmates feel better if they know they can defend themselves in some way help to keep everyone calm and quiet speak softly and calmly to help others fight off their panic remind them that your best chance of survival is if you all work together and keep cool heads 10 x research source you can quietly go over your plans to take their minds off of their fear remind others that staying calm and quiet will make it more likely that the shooter will pass over your room look or listen for classmates outside looking for shelter whether you let others into your classroom is up to your judgment if you believe you can help them inside without exposing yourself or others to the shooter you can do so but it may come at great risk if you do let them in open the door swiftly and decisively there s no time for hesitation listen carefully in the hallway if you don t hear gunshots for 10 or so minutes before someone asks to be let in it s probably safe to quickly open the door be aware that the shooter may pretend to be a classmate to get you to let them in listen closely to their voice and use your best judgment they should sound terrified and urgent which the shooter may not be able to fake distract the attacker if you can discreetly throw items away from the shooter to distract them don t confront the shooter just act unaware throw any object or make a sound to confuse or attract his attention keep them off balance and distracted for as long as you can while you and others try to make a getaway try to take them down from behind or if they seem weak you can throw objects like textbooks backpacks fire extinguishers or whatever you have on hand anything is better than nothing attack the shooter in a group as a last resort you have a better chance of bringing down the shooter as a group than alone approach from the side to avoid shots and use thick items like books or backpacks as shields your main goal is to separate the shooter from their gun 11 x research source if the shooter is near a wall or door try to grab their gun and force it to the wall to gain control of it attacking the shooter head on is risking your life but you may have no choice only try to fight them if you have no other options attacking the shooter will buy time for others to run to safety slide the gun away as soon as you can once you ve got the gun away from the shooter put it on the ground and slide it out of their reach you can push it with your hands or even use your feet to kick it away 12 x research source as you hold the shooter down tell a classmate to scoop the gun into a receptacle like a trash can don t let anyone pick up the gun with their hands police are looking for anyone holding a gun and might mistake your classmate for the shooter tell them to run towards the exit with the gun in the trash can and to give the gun to the police immediately immobilize the shooter s spine and head once you get the gun away if you manage to pull the shooter to the ground put all your weight on them to hold them down grapple for control of their spine head and hips which will control the rest of their movement 13 x research source hold the shooter down while others get away ask others to help if you get tired tell others to bring the police do your best to hold the shooter in place until they arrive learn all the exit routes from all areas of your school the best way to protect others during a school shooting is if you yourself are prepared for it do your best to memorize every possible exit route from each of your classrooms so that you can lead others to safety challenge yourself to learn shortcuts and alternate routes as well in case your main routes are blocked off or unsafe during a shooting take self defense classes knowing self defense can be invaluable against a shooter buying time for those around you to escape and saving your own life as well sign up for classes at a nearby gym or community center you should especially look for classes that teach you how to defend yourself against a shooter take the lessons seriously and work hard in class these skills could mean the difference between life and death in a school shooting scenario learn first aid to help possible victims look for emergency and first aid classes in your area usually offered at emergency training centers or community centers start with basic first aid which will teach you how to staunch blood flow and perform cpr among other skills once you master the basics move on to more advanced courses look for classes that teach you how to treat bullet wounds and other extreme trauma injuries even very basic first aid training can help you aid victims until the paramedics arrive you may even save someone s life work on being calm and resourceful in stressful situations if you want to be a leader in emergency situations you ll need maintain your cool and be able to quickly switch tactics practice this in all areas of your life so that you ll be able to control your emotions and think clearly in a school shooting situation whenever you feel stressed calm yourself by taking deep breaths and relaxing your muscles you can keep panic away by staying focused on what you have to do for example if you get lost while driving take a few deep breaths before you start to panic look at the situation calmly and figure out alternate routes you can take or find the nearest turnaround learn to feel your body s reactions to stress such as dizziness or a racing heart recognizing and learning to overcome these reactions is very important in a school shooting situation,Home-and-Garden
how to storm proof your home,severe storms like tornadoes or hurricanes are common during the summer months and can cause a lot of damage to a home by taking some safety precautions you can protect your home to reduce how much harm these storms cause by bracing your windows and securing your roof you can weather the storm with ease,measure the inside length and width of your windows use a tape measure inside the window casing to find the correct measurements for each window subtract 1 4 in 6 4 mm from each measurement to account for the clips you ll install later write each measurement down in a notebook so you can easily refer back to each window 1 x research source right down the location of each window next to the corresponding measurement in your notebook so you don t lose track purchase enough 1 2 in 1 3 cm thick plywood to cover all your windows go to your local hardware store with your measurements to get the amount of plywood you need opt for rot resistant wood like cedar or white oak so you can use it multiple times if necessary 2 x research source calculate the area beforehand by multiplying the length and width of each window if you don t purchase rot resistant wood you will also need to get a water resistant sealer for your wood plywood will come in large sheets and you will need to cut pieces out to fit your particular window sizes cut the plywood to size with a saw set one of the plywood sheets on top of 2 saw horses or clamp the edge to a table mark the sizes you need to cut on the plywood in pencil using the measurements you took earlier use a circular or hand saw to cut along the lines you ve drawn 3 x research source wear safety glasses when working with saws so you don t get any sawdust in your eyes label each piece of plywood you cut out with where it will be placed for example if your plywood is for your kitchen window use a permanent marker to write kitchen on the wood put tension clips on the sides of the plywood 24 in 61 cm apart make sure the side of the clip with the teeth is facing away from the wood push the clips onto the left and right edges of the plywood at least 6 inches 15 cm from the top and tap them lightly with a hammer to secure them in place place more tension clips on each side for larger pieces of wood but make sure they are no further than 24 inches 61 cm apart 4 x research source tension clips can be purchased at your local hardware store tension clips will not hold tightly on vinyl siding if your piece of wood is smaller than 2 by 2 ft 0 61 by 0 61 m you only need 1 tension clip in the center of the left and right sides push the plywood into the inside facing window frame to secure it hold the plywood up to the window and push it firmly into the casing the teeth on the tension clips will catch on the sides and hold the wood securely in place when strong winds try to blow inside 5 x research source have a friend help you lift the plywood inside the casing if you can t pick it up on your own remove the wooden panels after the storm passes to remove the panels push the plywood in with one hand and pull the tension clips so the teeth aren t stuck in the wall with your other hand do this on one side of the plywood and the other side should easily slide right out 6 x research source be careful of any broken glass or debris that may have damaged the window during the storm store the plywood and clips in a dry area like a garage or basement to reuse them make sure the plywood is raised off the ground check your roof for any shingles that are broken or loose climb a ladder and visually inspect your roof look for any tears cracks or areas without any shingles any damage weakens the integrity of your roof and could cause leaks or more shingles to come loose 7 x research source if you want to stay on the ground use a pair of binoculars to scan your roof for any damage make sure the ladder is secure and locked before you start climbing it set the ladder on a firm surface so it won t slip have a friend hold the ladder for support if it feels shaky if you know a storm is coming check your roof 3 to 4 weeks in advance to prepare apply adhesive caulk on the underside of any loose shingles lift the bottom edge of the shingle and apply thick strips of caulk with a caulk gun if your shingles are cracked or torn apply caulk on top of the crack to seal it 8 x research source caulk guns can be purchased at your local hardware store shingles breaking or cracking when you try to lift them is a sign of old age and they need to be replaced hire a professional roofing service if you re uncomfortable with heights professionals will be able to see the damage you may not recognize and are trained for working on roofs press the shingle down firmly with your foot once you applied the caulk apply pressure to it for about 2 minutes while it sets put your weight on one of your feet so the shingle lays flush on your roof again repeat the process for any other loose or broken shingles on your roof 9 x research source install metal roofing if you live in an area with frequent severe storms metal roofing will last close to 50 years and can survive winds up to 140 mph 230 km h to install metal roofing layer the panels so there are no gaps between them then screw the panels together so they hold firmly but not so tightly that it damages the paneling 10 x research source have a professional install metal roofing if you feel uncomfortable doing it yourself clean out your gutters and downspouts wear thick gloves while you remove any branches or leaves that are caught in your gutters run water through your gutters and downspouts to make sure they drain efficiently once you ve cleaned them out clean gutters will help remove water from your roof to minimize any damage 11 x research source if you have any clogs use a power washer or a plumbing snake to break through any of the obstruction consider getting seamless gutters to prevent any further clogs or backups cut dead branches off of your trees so they don t break during the storm use a ladder and a saw to get rid of any dead vegetation around your home look for branches without leaves or ones that may be snapped off during high winds the branches could break off and damage your home 12 x research source if you have a large tree that s dying or broken hire a professional removal service to get rid of it remove any heavy fruits like coconuts from the tree if you live in a tropical area remove any bird feeders or objects hanging from the branches take any outdoor furniture inside move patio chairs inside your home if they fit inside move large furniture into a garage or secure them to the side of your home with multiple bungee cords 13 x research source moving outdoor furniture inside will prevent it from getting thrown into your home during a storm with strong winds brace your garage door many garage doors will have kits you can purchase to brace the individual panels horizontally and vertically find the kit that matches the brand of garage door you have the braces will prevent the wind from breaking through the door and damaging your home 14 x research

expected it s essential that you re able to identify mudslide warning signs read on to know what to look for and how to ride out the mudslide drive away from the mudslide if you have time when you see warning signs of a mudslide or hear of them on the news begin evacuating listen carefully to reports so you can avoid driving through other areas at risk drive carefully and avoid flooded roads which may occur if the mudslides are caused by heavy rain if you see a flooded street turn around and find an alternate route never drive through water of an unknown depth even 6 inches 15 cm of water can cause cars to stall 1 foot 30 cm will make most cars float while 2 feet 61 cm moving water can carry away even large cars 2 x research source look out for and avoid downed power lines 3 x research source if you have time warn neighbors of the danger if the mudslide is not yet in the news call your fire or police department run sideways away from the mudslide if you re outside if the mudslide is imminent or the roads are too damaged to drive you may still be able to escape by foot run away from the mudslide at a right angle as quickly as is safely possible don t try to run towards the mudslide or downhill from it you likely won t be able to outrun it 4 x research source some mudslides can be over a mile wide if you don t know how wide a mudslide is and can t see the end of it or if

health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source pay attention to rain reports if you re in an area with damaged soil mudslides occur most frequently after a fire has weakened soil on a steep slope heavy rain can destabilize the soil and cause a mudslide if a fire has burned over a hill near your house and new trees and vegetation haven t been able to regrow yet stay alert for rain forecasts if heavy rain occurs in your area be on the lookout for warning signs of a mudslide 6 x research source stay alert and awake during severe storms if you re at risk of a mudslide if you live near an at risk slope and are experiencing a major storm stay awake and be alert to warning signs many deaths from mudslides happen when people are asleep and aren t able to prepare by staying awake watching the news and being prepared you ll be able to evacuate or get to higher ground if necessary 7 x research source look for tilting trees or fences as signs that a mudslide is starting mudslides will push over trees fences and utility poles be on the lookout for these objects being tilted or pushed over which often indicates that a mudslide is beginning watch for cracks in the soil especially on slopes look at the top of the slope and see if the ground looks like it s cracking open this means that dirt and debris is starting to slide a sign that a mudslide is about to start the mudslide will start slowly from this point but will rapidly pick up speed 8 x research source you can also look for bulges at the base of the slope which indicate that the dirt at the top of the slope has started to slide down observe sudden building damage or doors and windows jamming when the ground begins to slip during a mudslide you might see outside structures such as stairs begin to separate from their buildings for the same reason doors or windows might start jamming as doorways and hinges are disrupted by the shifting ground 9 x research source look for water accumulating in unusual places the shifting ground that occurs during a mudslide might cause water to gather in places where it usually wouldn t such as on ground that s normally flat or drains well it can also cause a drop in water levels in streams and creeks look out your windows and see if you notice any puddles in odd places or a sudden decrease in water in a nearby creek 10 x research source listen for rumbling noises but remain inside your house mudslides are typically preceded by a rumbling sound made by the earth and debris as it rushes down a hillside stay alert and listen for these noises it might be too late to leave your house if you can hear the approaching mudslide so stay inside and prepare as well as you can 11 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source go upstairs or on the roof to avoid the main flow of the mudslide getting to a higher level in your house can help you avoid getting stuck in or swept away by the mud if you don t have a second story go onto the roof as long as you can do so safely move quickly but carefully and stay calm 12 x research source staying upstairs or on the roof can also make it easier for helicopter rescue crews to see and rescue you if you don t have a second floor and can t get to the roof find a sturdy piece of furniture to hide behind such as a table or large desk curl up on the floor and cover your head as the slide passes through crouch down tightly and protect your head from debris if you re still inside take shelter under a table or in a bathtub if you re on the roof simply crouch down and wrap your arms around your head 13 x research source get out of your car if you were hit by a mudslide while driving if you re able to exit your car safely roll down your windows and plan out an escape route before opening the door make sure you re able to make it completely out of the

leak by rupture from movement of a building or equipment due to a storm etc the equipment being used may be defective or there may be some other cause for the leakage of carbon monoxide such as inadequate ventilation carbon monoxide from these sources can build up in enclosed or partially enclosed spaces typical spaces where problems can occur include house rooms garages rvs boats tents campers garden sheds marquees etc people and animals situated in enclosed spaces with little or no ventilation can die from breathing carbon monoxide smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb f f6

how to manage food and water while taking shelter in emergencies,taking shelter is critical in times of disaster sheltering is appropriate when conditions require that you seek protection in your home place of employment or other location where you are when disaster strikes sheltering outside the hazard area would have staying with friends and relatives seeking commercial lodging or staying in a mass care facility operated by disaster relief groups in conjunction with local authorities during extended periods of sheltering you will need to manage water and food supplies to ensure you and your family have the required supplies and quantities guidance on how to accomplish this follows,allow people to drink according to their needs many people need even more than the average of one half gallon per day the individual amount needed depends on age physical activity physical condition and time of year never ration water unless ordered to do so by authorities drink the amount you need today and try to find more for tomorrow under no circumstances should a person drink less than one quart four cups of water each day you can minimize the amount of water your body needs by reducing activity and staying cool turn off the main water valves you will need to protect the water sources already in your home from contamination if you hear reports of broken water or sewage lines or if local officials advise you of a problem to close the incoming water source locate the incoming valve and turn it to the closed position be sure you and other family members know how to perform this important procedure to use the water in your pipes let air into the plumbing by turning on the faucet in your home at the highest level a small amount of water will trickle out then obtain water from the lowest faucet in the home to use the water in your hot water tank be sure the electricity or gas is off and open the drain at the bottom of the tank start the water flowing by turning off the water intake valve at the tank and turning on the hot water faucet refill the tank before turning the gas or electricity back on if the gas is turned off a professional will be needed to turn it back

how to install erosion control blankets,erosion control blankets are a type of artificial groundcover designed to prevent or minimize topsoil loss in agricultural and landscaping sites most types of blankets are made from natural biodegradable fibers which are woven together to form a loose mesh installing erosion control blankets on patches of land vulnerable to wind or water erosion is as simple as rolling them out and tacking them down when covering larger areas such as farmland you can save yourself valuable time and labor by using an all terrain utility vehicle to unroll your blankets,purchase enough blankets to manage erosion on your selected site erosion control blankets and other rolled erosion control products are available from specialty agricultural and landscaping suppliers you may also be able to find them at some home improvement centers or smaller gardening shops if you don t have any luck at these places you always have the option of ordering your materials online 1 x research source a good way to determine how many blankets you need is to measure your site then divide its total area into sections that correspond to the dimensions of the product you re looking at consider buying an extra blanket to account for possible miscalculations or waste blankets come in a wide range of natural and synthetic materials including straw jute coconut fiber aspen fiber or polypropylene plastic there are no major differences between these materials except for polypropylene which is not biodegradable like the rest 2 x research source prices vary between products but on average you can expect to pay around 40 60 for a 4 ft 1 2 m x 100 120 ft 30 37 m roll and roughly 150 for a 4 ft 1 2 m x 200 225 ft 61 69 m roll clear your installation site of weeds debris and other potential obstacles before you get started make a circuit of the area and inspect the soil closely for things like rocks branches roots dirt clods and unwanted vegetation gather up any such items you find and dispose of them or relocate them to another part of your property 3 x research source if necessary use a shovel pitchfork tiller or aerator to gently break up compacted soil after clearing your site of possible obstructions for best results your erosion control blanket or blankets should lie directly against the surface of the topsoil dig a shallow trench at the top of the slope to install a blanket on a hill use a shovel or spade to remove about 1 2 ft 0 15 m of soil in a straight line across the upper part of the slope this slight depression will help to anchor the blanket preventing gravity from dragging it downwards once it s in place 4 x research source keep all of your loose soil together in one neat pile that way you ll be able to simply push it back in when it comes time to backfill the trench there s no need to do any digging if you re going to be using your blanket on flat ground line the trench with the loose end of the blanket work 2 3 feet 0 61 0 91 m of material free from the roll and drape it over the depression then smooth it down by hand make sure that the last 4 6 inches 10 15 cm of the material is resting on the level terrain above the trench itself otherwise it may shift compromising the blanket s hold 5 x research source hold off on unrolling the rest of the blanket until you ve properly secured the loose end tack the loose end to the soil using the included fasteners most erosion control blankets come packaged with their own specially designed pins or staples for ease of installation space the fasteners out along the blanket as directed then sink them deep into the soil at the center of the trench using a hammer or rubber mallet 6 x research source if your blanket didn t come with its own fasteners you may need to pick up some biodegradable anchor spikes or metal landscape staples separately if your blanket didn t come with detailed installation instructions place a fastener 6 8 inches 15 20 cm from either side of the blanket s loose edge then drive a third into the midpoint overlap the edges of additional blankets by 2 5 in 5 1 12 7 cm if you re installing more than one blanket lay out each subsequent blanket inside the vertical edge of the blanket beside it by creating a little overlap you can avoid leaving the intervening soil exposed 7 x research source most manufacturers recommend an average overlap of around 4 inches 10 cm but you might add or subtract a couple of inches depending on the dimensions of the blankets you re working with and the size of the area you re trying to cover refill the blanketed trench with soil return to the pile of soil you removed earlier and use your shovel or spade to push it back into the lined trench afterwards smooth the soil and pat the surface lightly with the flat part of your digging tool to tamp it down together the pins or staples and compacted soil will ensure that the upper end of your blanket stays put 8 x research source come back and check your anchor trench every couple of days if possible it may be necessary to periodically replenish or recompact the soil if your site is affected by severe erosion unroll the remainder of the blanket and fasten it every 2 3 feet 0 61 0 91 m once you ve secured the loose end begin working your way towards the blanket s opposite end driving a pin or staple into both vertical edges of the material at regular intervals be sure to line up your fasteners as symmetrically as possible and sink them flush with the surface of the surrounding soil 9 x research source when installing multiple blankets secure the outer edge as described then drive your fasteners into the strip of material where the two blankets overlap on the inner edge with certain products the manufacturers may recommend staggering the fasteners by 18 24 inches 46 61 cm along its vertical axis for additional security 10 x research source if your fasteners are improperly spaced your blanket could twist pull or bunch all of which will make it less effective for its intended purpose replace your blankets up to 4 times a year as needed when properly installed and maintained most small biodegradable erosion control blankets will last between 3 and 6 months assuming the quality of the soil at your site hasn t seen drastic improvement by the end of this timeframe it may be necessary to prepare a new blanket or series of blankets 11 x research source investing in long or extended term products can help you cut down on your number of annual re installations these are made from highly resilient materials that are capable of surviving the elements as long as 12 36 months till fertilize and seed planting sites prior to installation if you re putting down one or more erosion control blankets on land where you grow crops or flowering plants you ll first need to take the appropriate measures to prepare the site for installation depending on what you re cultivating and how developed your land already is this might involve tasks like tilling or aerating fertilizing and or sowing or germinating new seeds 12 x research source to promote healthy germination and avoid growth complications plan on installing your erosion control blankets within 24 hours of seeding 13 x research source once the blankets are in place your crops or plants will grow right up through the loosely woven mesh order enough blankets to cover the area where erosion is a problem search for erosion control blankets plus the name of your town or city to find a reputable dealer near you blankets designed specifically for agricultural use are comprised of all natural biodegradable fibers typically straw or a mixture of materials they re much larger than the kind of blankets used for gardening and landscaping sites and often come in sizes as large as 16 feet 4 9 m x 562 5 feet 171 5 m 14 x research source measuring your site can help you figure out exactly how meet feet you ll need for areas that are too big to measure effectively simply distribute your blankets among the spots where erosion is the worst due to the sheer size and weight of these blankets you ll most likely need to have them delivered some manufacturers may also offer to take care of the installation process for you for an additional cost attach the rolled blanket to an atv using the twin unroller units after your blankets have been unloaded at your installation site slide the long arms of each unroller into the open cavity on either end of the roll connect the dual tow lines to the eyes of the unrollers using the built in clips

how to prepare your family for an emergency evacuation,evacuations are more common than many people realize hundreds of times each year transportation and industrial accidents release harmful substances forcing thousands of people to leave their homes fires and floods cause evacuations even more frequently almost every year people along the gulf and atlantic coasts evacuate in the face of approaching hurricanes the amount of time you have to leave will depend on the hazard if the event is a weather condition such as a hurricane that can be monitored you might have a day or two to get ready however many disasters allow no time for people to gather even the most basic necessities which is why planning ahead is essential,know how your community is prepared to respond to emergencies ask local authorities about evacuation routes and if your community has disaster emergency plans ask for a hard copy of the plan and also inquire how often the plan is updated what hazards it covers and any other details you may think of find out what plans are in place for your workplace and your children s school or daycare center discuss with your employer and school and or daycare center the policies regarding disasters and emergencies such as how warning information will be provided and disaster procedures followed know the following about your children s school emergency plans how the school will communicate during a crisis if the school has adequate food water and other basic supplies if the school is prepared to shelter in place if need be and where they plan to go if they must get away establish escape routes draw a floor plan of your home use a blank sheet of paper for each floor mark two escape routes from each room make sure children understand the drawings post a copy of the drawings at eye level in each child s room establish a place to meet in the event of an emergency such as a fire plan how each family member will contact one another if they are not together when disaster strikes complete a contact card for each family member and have family members keep these cards handy in a wallet purse backpack etc you may want to send one to school with each child to keep on file pick a friend or relative who lives out of state for household members to notify they are safe obtain property health and life insurance if you do not have them and feel they are necessary review existing policies for the amount and extent of coverage to ensure that what you have in place is what is required for you and your family for all possible hazards consider purchasing insurance specifically for certain disasters such as flooding hurricanes or tornadoes make a record of your personal property for insurance purposes take photos or a video of the interior and exterior of your home include personal belongings in your inventory be aware of the types of special assistance family members may need the hearing impaired will need special arrangements to receive warnings the mobility impaired may require special assistance to reach shelter and people with certain dietary needs must have appropriate food supplies create a network of neighbors relatives friends and coworkers to aid you in an emergency discuss your needs and make sure everyone knows how to operate necessary equipment if you live in an apartment building ask the management to mark accessible exits clearly and to make arrangements to help you leave the building keep specialized items ready including extra wheelchair batteries oxygen catheters medication food for service animals and any other items you might need be sure to make provisions for medications that require refrigeration and keep a list of the type and model numbers of the medical devices anyone requires plan for pet disaster needs by identifying shelter gathering pet supplies ensuring your pet has proper id and up to date veterinarian records and providing a pet carrier and leash with the exception of service animals pets are not typically permitted in emergency shelters as they may affect the health and safety of other occupants find out which local hotels and motels allow pets and where pet boarding facilities are located be sure to research some outside your local area in case local facilities close for more advice and information call your local emergency management office animal shelter or animal control office create a family disaster plan to begin this process gather all family members and review the information you gained about local emergency plans and warning systems your family plan should address how the previous steps will be addressed in case of a disaster keep a full tank of gas in your car if an evacuation seems likely e g encroaching hurricane rumbling volcano tornado season gas stations may be closed during emergencies and unable to pump gas during power outages plan to take one car per family to reduce congestion and delay if you do not own a car make transportation arrangements with friends your local government or community members gather important medications and supplies as you evacuate if a family member has a chronic medical condition that requires medication make sure to bring their medicine and prescription information with you when you evacuate in addition grab all of the emergency supplies for your evacuation including first aid items food and water in order to acquire refills of important medication identify a pharmacy in the area where you are evacuating and confirm that it s open shut off all utilities if you have enough time before evacuating natural gas leaks and explosions are responsible for a significant number of fires following disasters it is vital that all household members know how to shut off natural gas because there are different gas shut off procedures for different gas meter configurations contact your local gas company for guidance on preparation and response regarding gas appliances and gas service to your home water becomes a vital resource during a disaster so it is important to locate the cut off valve outside the house and turn it off electrical sparks can ignite natural gas leaks so make sure

turn off all the lights and close all the curtains open all the doors even if it is the middle of winter and wait patiently in a corner until your guest has gone after this you should do a clean sweep of the house look for any damages or waste the animal may have left behind then vacuum to remove any trace and hire a carpet cleaner as soon as you can admittedly you can t always use your knees as an accurate measure for when to panic the truth is that you shouldn t even have a centimeter of water on any floor the most likely cause for this is a plumbing malfunction as the weather usually stays outside and unfortunately you ll need to keep your wits about you shut off your electricity at the mains most likely these will be high off the ground and you ll be able to reach them but if there are any plugs on the ground or the water has risen over plug points get out of there make sure that any and all plugs and wires are nowhere near the water if you can t switch off the mains call emergency services then call an emergency plumber unless you know exactly what you re doing you can t begin cleaning or draining until the source of the problem is gone depending on the length of time your

children or the elderly keep the area damp blot the area with paper towel or a clean cloth add water at room temperature to the area to dilute as you blot mix a quick solution of 1 tbsp dish soap 1 tbsp white vinegar and 2 cups of lukewarm water and pat the area until it s clean if you don t have vinegar on hand or you can t attend to the spill immediately liberally sprinkle salt over the area and spray with water occasionally until you can attend to it strangely enough white wine will work in the place of water stop flushing the toilet once should be enough for you to see the water level rising try to determine the cause of the blockage if it s a child s toy or your cell phone you ll need to go in there with your hands if it is biological waste or a paper clog grab the nearest plunger

your hand in the toilet put on some shoes carefully pick up any large pieces of glass and rest them on a sheet of newspaper use a broom and dustpan on the first pass over the area empty onto the newspaper carefully run a damp paper towel over the area vacuum the area gently wrap the newspaper over the glass using as many sheets as you can tuck this into a plastic bag and tie closed get

how to prevent a landslide,landslides can range from minor inconveniences that leave debris on your property to major accidents that can cause severe damage naturally if you live in a landslide prone area you d want to do all you can to protect your property while you can t always prevent them there are a number of precautions you can take to lower the risk of a landslide occurring on your property and decrease the damage you ll experience if one happens,remove loose or heavy material from the top of the slope rocks fallen trees and other debris at the top of a hill can put your property at risk for a landslide clean off all the slopes on your property to remove material that might come loose move this debris away from the slope on the base or off your property altogether 1 x research source you might need a professional with heavy equipment to remove heavy rocks and soil consult a contractor on hauling away heavy material like this be courteous to your neighbors when you relocate this material don t put them in a place where they could slide onto your neighbors property avoid piling junk at the top of a hill if your property sits on the edge of a hill keep all loose debris away from that slope these can come loose and slide down the hill whether you have scrap wood lawn cuttings or spare parts pile all debris at least 10 feet 3 0 m away from the edge 2 x research source keep any loose material like firewood or trash cans away from the slope as well don t dump water at the top of the slope either this can gradually erode the soil and make it looser build sheds or other structures away from an edge if you re planning a new shed or similar structure keep it far away from the edge of a slope consult an engineer to tell you what a safe distance from the slope is and follow that advice before you start building 3 x research source there isn t a hard rule on how far structures should be from the slope it depends on the soil drainage slope and how prone the area is to landslides fix any leaks in your pipes or drainage system leaks in your water system can gradually erode the soil under your property have a professional go through your pipes and make sure there are no leaks if they do locate leaks fix them right away 4 x trustworthy source u s geological survey u s government agency responsible for conducting scientific research on the nation s land natural resources and natural disasters go to source there are a few signs that you might have a water leak these include an unusually high water bill a musty smell in some areas of your home or puddles on your property when it hasn t rained recently remember to check your outdoor water lines as well like your hose pool and sprinkler system if you have one leaky pools are a particular cause of gradual soil erosion install flexible fittings to prevent your pipes from breaking flexible fittings won t crack which helps prevent water leaks use these fittings at turns and angles in your pipe system so your water lines are more resilient 5 x research source installing flexible fittings is similar to installing regular pipes you can do it yourself if you feel confident or have a plumber do the job flexible fittings are especially useful in areas prone to landslides because they ll resist breaking if there s a shift in the ground you can use flexible fittings in your gas lines as well this is a dangerous job that could cause a gas leak if it s done incorrectly so don t do it yourself in some areas it s even illegal to work on gas lines by without a license have someone who works for your gas provider make this adjustment make sure your drainage system leads directly to the base of the incline if you have a downspout or similar drainage system to carry water away from your home make sure it runs all the way to the bottom of the slope this stops the water from pooling or running down the slope and loosening the ground 6 x research source you might not be able to drain the water all the way to the bottom if the base is further than your property goes instead make sure your system flows into the nearest storm drain or a natural runoff area make sure the water drains far away from your neighbors as well you wouldn t want them draining their water onto your property avoid building sprinkler systems on a slope these can loosen and erode soil making the slope more unstable always locate your sprinkler system a safe distance from the slope so the land remains stable 7 x research source if a professional engineer installs your irrigation system they should know what a safe distance away from the slope would be if you do it yourself check any local codes that state how far the irrigation system must be from a slope remove loose soil and replace it with more dense material over time soil can erode and grow more prone to landslides speak with a contractor about replacing your topsoil with denser sandy soil that s more tightly packed this can help make the

suggestions for guiding you through survivor s guilt whether you were in the actual disaster yourself or you re experiencing because of proximity to the disaster or your relationships with the people who have suffered it note this article is aimed at both those who have been a part of the disaster and those who feel a sense of proximity to it for one reason or other however if you were actually a part of the disaster it is vital to get debriefing at the very least and to seek counseling for any concerns and emotional problems that you are experiencing this article presumes that you are doing so,understand that there is nobody to blame when nature vents her fury accepting this is essential because it allows you to see that everyone feels powerless when a terrible natural disaster event occurs that harms and kills many people nobody could have stopped it and nobody is at fault sure there will always be things that could have been done better from improving building codes to giving out more warnings but the actual event itself will always stem from something over which human beings have little control minimize your media intake if you find yourself getting really upset by all the images to the point of not being able to function for crying and feeling upset you re no good to anybody and it s a pointless way to honor those who have lost their lives and livelihoods instead take a break until you feel a bit better perhaps an early night will right things and then be very careful about how much you take on board until your emotional strength returns find ways to act constructively from helplessness turn to doing constructive activities that can help the victims whether you have suffered damage yourself but have survived the event intact or whether you re someone who lives nearby or you re someone who has read about it all unfolding online feeling that you can help is an important part of minimizing survivor s guilt some of the constructive things you can do include if you have skills or knowledge that can directly assist those in need offer your time if you have medical organizational cooking first aid rescue legal accounting animal welfare counseling child minding plumbing electrical building etc skills all of these and more can help people in need sometimes volunteer groups get together such as the christchurch student volunteer army and you can

support its body with anything soft to minimize movement during transportation 2 x research source for more significant injuries or in scenarios where the dog is having trouble breathing or is unconscious you ll want to move it as little as possible see the section in this article on dealing with specific injuries carry a dog with a minor injury in your arms if you do not have a carrier the dog only has a limb injury and you can carry it safely with both arms it is fine to do so use one to support the chest and reach over with your other arm looping it beneath the dog s abdomen just in front of its hind legs 3 x research source do you best not to move or otherwise agitate an injury but make sure to fully support the dog s body with your arms carry large dogs on a stretcher if another person is available to help use something stiff such as a board to carry a large dog or a dog that is seriously injured position the dog on its side taking care not to bend its body if you have anything soft wedge it along the dog s body to minimize its movement when lifting with the assistance of another person position yourselves on either side of the stretcher bend and lift simultaneously using your legs to support the weight position your hands as far apart from one another as is comfortable the tray from a dog crate is another good option for a stretcher if you have something that can secure the dog in place such as a belt use it to do so 4 x research source always position a fastening device over the shoulders or hips so as not to obstruct the ribs or abdomen use a soft material as a stretcher if you have no stiff mobile surface a blanket or coat can be used as well position the material beneath the dog in a way that will support its body lengthwise if the material is not large enough to hold the dog in place while moving use something to fasten it to the stretcher 5 x research source a soft material will only help you carry a dog if you have another person to assist you stand on opposite sides of the material and lift from the corners pulling away from one another to keep the material as taught as possible prevent the dog s body from bending as

its side place a board or blanket behind the dog s back along its spine position yourself behind the dog as well tightly grip a fold of the dog s skin above its neck with one hand and above its hips with the other pull the dog carefully onto the board or other material lift one edge of the stretcher and drag it in the direction of help 6 x research source muzzle the dog even if you know the dog

directly observe it 8 x research source check for evidence of a spine injury if the dog has injured their spine it is especially important that you carry them on a firm stiff surface evidence of a spine injury include immobility or wobbliness in the rear legs unconsciousness differently sized pupils partial or complete paralysis or blood flowing from the dog s orifices 9 x research source there are many options for flat surfaces to use as stretchers aside from a board you can use a sled table leaf bookshelf ironing board or even a window screen 10 x research source make sure the dog lays on its side and that its body is not twisted while moving it carefully onto the stretcher have someone help you carefully move them onto the stretcher if possible position an unconscious dog s head position the head of an unconscious dog in normal alignment with the dog s body with the dog on its side this means the snout should be pointed forward or a bit downward this is important to maintain both airflow to the lungs and blood flow to the brain if the dog has vomited position the head slightly downward to allow vomit to easily vacate the dog s mouth 11 x research source be aware the a dog that has suffered a head injury is likely to vomit even if they are unconscious do not splint a clearly broken limb if the dog s limb is clearly broken wrap it in something clean such as gauze or a towel and tape it in place the goal is reducing movement of the leg as you move the dog make sure to support the entire limb so that it cannot bend at the point where it was broken or fractured 12 x research source do not attempt to push broken bones back into place stop uncontrolled bleeding if the dog bleeds continuously for more than five minutes you need to take steps to control the bleeding first apply pressure with a clean material ideally a padded bandage or gauze this will at least slow the loss of blood if you have wrap and or tape wrap a bleeding wound with tension equal to gently pressing on the wound 13 x research source minimize spine and neck movement during transportation while carrying a dog on a stretcher or driving them wedge anything you have that s soft around the dog s body to keep their body from moving around unnecessarily pillows or rolled up towels and blankets are ideal 14 x research source cover the dog unless it is quite warm use a blanket towel or piece of clothing to wrap the dog during transportation not only will this calm the dog down if will prevent heat loss that may occur due to shock or injury 15 x research source have someone else drive if anyone else is around have someone else drive to the vet this will allow you to help keep the dog from moving around further this will keep you from driving distractedly 16 x research source call the vet en route call the veterinary hospital to let them know you re on your way describe the dog s injuries to help the vet prepare for your arrival and start helping the dog as efficiently as possible if no one else is around to drive complete the call before getting on the road 17 x research source another benefit of calling ahead is ensuring that the vet you re heading for is capable of treating your dog if they are not you may be able to have a vet meet you there for emergency service or they can tell you where to go instead,Home-and-Garden

how to prepare horses for a hurricane,if you re a horse owner hurricane preparedness includes preparing to keep your horses safe it is important to have evacuation plans sorted out well in advance along with having sufficient back up measures if you are not able to evacuate the horses in time there are quite a few things to consider so prepare well ahead of hurricane season and do a few drills for practice,make an evacuation plan this is the preferred option to keep your horses safe although always realize that it may be hard to carry out your plan if there are obstacles in the way of catching scared horses and getting them out in time having an evacuation plan in place will help to ensure that it runs smoothly if you are able to go through with it write your plan down and post it in the barn give copies to anyone else who might be involved in caring for your horses and go over it with them so everyone is clear on how to help choose a location to travel to it must be well away from any coastal areas and in an area known to be safe from hurricanes when choosing the place consider the following do you have the means to evacuate the horses the distance required this includes having the appropriate transportation and horse trailer s if you have more than 2 horses do you have other people who will be able to transport out the remaining horses if so are they aware that this will be expected of them is the location you ve chosen horse friendly can you be assured of keeping your horses there safely and feeding and exercising them as required for example can you go to the farm of a family member or friend or is it a known evacuation place suitable for horses large animal shelters may be able to accept your horses but you ll need to know and confirm this well before an actual emergency situation ever occurs get their agreement in writing if possible what are the costs involved in transporting your horses there do you have an emergency fund set up to cover these costs what are the insurance implications of evacuating or not evacuating your horses decide when you ll put an evacuation plan into action it is no good leaving as the hurricane descends to get your horses to safety you ll need to leave at least 72 hours before the hurricane is set to arrive in your location inform your neighbors of your evacuation plans they may wish to join your plan if they have horses or they may simply appreciate knowing what you intend to do and offer to look out for your house and ranch if you do have to go away if your neighbors have horses you might like to plan a shared group transportation fleet to help get all of the horses out in time do a trial run of preparing to evacuate this will help you to catch things that you haven t planned properly for as well as giving you a sense of the timing involved and what sorts of things you must watch out for under pressure time the evacuation drill to see how much time it takes to do everything obviously don t drive the horses off your property during a drill do as much as possible in the drill up to the leaving stage you can t replicate the conditions of being on the road during an emergency event so it s not worth the effort and expense pack an emergency gear pack for evacuation in this pack include all of the needs for your traveling horses including medicines first aid items bandages etc and food and water halters saddles and any other gear you know you ll need should be easily locatable or spares placed near the emergency gear pack pack whatever you can pack ahead of time in an easily identifiable bag or series of bags including spare horse gear write a legible list of what to grab in the event of an evacuation and place it in an accessible location this will cover items you can t add to an emergency pack because they re in everyday use such as saddles bridles blankets etc having a list can help calm any sense of panic and allows you to refer to it methodically as you prepare to leave keep a record of the local authorities and businesses you might need to contact including the police animal control stock feed suppliers and your local veterinary clinics not just your own but all of them put this list in your emergency pack and make sure everyone involved in your plan has a copy mark packed emergency gear clearly in some cases you may need to send someone else to grab this gear and you ll need to be able to direct them to the precise items you need ensure that all of your horses are properly identified this means having some form of permanent identification microchip tattoo etc and something less permanent such as a tag or spray paint you can buy an emergency id tag that you can quickly and easily clip into the horse s tail or mane have each of your horses properly up to date with vaccinations tetanus and encephalitis vaccinations should be current along with any other relevant vaccinations pertinent to your location make it easy for people to locate you if they happen to end up with your lost horse add your cell phone number email address pager number and if possible social media information keep copies of the microchip numbers and other relevant digital information in the cloud so that it is easily retrievable for example email yourself a copy or upload it to your form of cloud storage such as a permanent online account also keep physical copies because it is very possible to lose access to those files and you need to be able to retrieve your horse have digital images of your horses stored as well if your horses do go missing images can be very helpful especially for people more inclined to look for patterns and colors than for microchip data or tags have all of your usual emergency farm ranch and household supplies sorted out well in advance this includes tools generators fuel food and water medications etc prepare whatever is needed for all persons remaining on the property have sufficient lighting flashlights etc batteries and a battery powered radio as part of your household emergency kit keep the farm ranch and yard areas clear of debris throughout the year in particular ensure that items that might present a danger during a hurricane are appropriately stored away or tied down during the hurricane season doing this can help to reduce the amount of debris flying or floating around during the storm decide where the horses are likely to be the safest will this be in a barn in a particular field or in some building not usually designated for the horses if you aren t sure ask people who do know to help you scout out the best locations to keep horses on your property during the emergency event if your horses are used to staying in a stall or barn look for a secure outdoor location for them putting your horses in an unfamiliar location or new type of housing can be extra stressful for them if your property is likely to be flooded do not keep the horses in a building they will be more likely to survive if they can run to higher ground of their own accord if using a barn or building remove all hanging items and anything that could cause a threat to the scared horses keep the area as clear as possible keep the barn in a safe condition replace anything loose or broken immediately upon discovery regular maintenance is essential when living in an environment where emergency events are always possible keep a supply of additional food for the horses if you re planning to stay it is advisable to always have an additional 3 weeks of food stored for emergencies as that may be the length of time before help can be obtained for your livestock and horses whose needs are often ranked more lowly than those of people when storing food choose a dry high and safe location to keep it do a regular check to ensure that it is not being enjoyed by rats or other animals during storage and replace it every few months with a fresh batch of food so that no food ever goes to waste keep water supplies have emergency water tanks installed and only use these when necessary arrange several large plastic garbage cans with secure lids for filling with water in the event of an emergency these can be slowly drawn on as the horse s water supply if needed always secure the lid carefully to ensure that no water is lost if the can accidentally tips over develop a telephone tree for calling and texting neighbors when remaining in place realize that texting is a good option as it is less likely to overload the phone systems and is less drain on your phone s battery texts also tend to eventually get through even if there are initial delays by staying in touch neighbors can help each other during and after the emergency event find your horses if they have weathered the storm outside this may require doing some asking around with your neighbors if your horses have taken off anywhere use that cellphone tree you d already set up as a way to keep an eye out for each other s livestock and horses clean up your property as soon as it is safe to do so clear away debris and start making the property safe for your horses and for people as soon as possible use appropriate caution around anything electric and if any item on your property has been submerged take great care until you know what is under the water do not touch anything if you do not know it s safe wait for the professionals to come and asses it water damaged items are likely to need replacement and or removal so be prepared for this get your insurance documents out and ready for processing keep your horses safe during recovery try to avoid keeping your horses in wet damp or moldy environments after the storm these environments are unhealthy and could be the source of infections or diseases that stressed horses may be more susceptible to if possible rig a dry temporary shelter for them until their usual places have dried out in terms of planning it might be useful to store some wood for a temporary shelter in a high up place,Home-and-Garden

flat or only slightly undulating land if you don t know the elevation level of your home school or workplace find out some local authorities use elevation as a warning indicator there are warning signs indicating that your area is prone to tsunamis your local authorities have issued information about the potential for tsunamis natural sea barriers such as levees of dunes have been removed for development be aware if tsunamis have struck your coastal region in the past do some library research or ask at the local government office fema has a website enabling online flood risk searches 1 x research source most tsunamis happen in what s called the ring of fire an area in the pacific ocean known for its geologic activity chile the western united states japan and the philippines are especially vulnerable prepare essential materials in an easy to obtain location if a tsunami or another natural disaster hits chances are you ll need a few survival items and you ll need them fast it can be helpful to have both a safety and survival pack already assembled make a safety pack food water and a first aid kit are among the basics required keep the safety pack somewhere obvious well known to everyone in the building and easy to grab in an emergency it can also help to leave a raincoat or other coat for each person near the safety pack make a personal survival pack for each person in the family and a family survival pack with common items for everyone include a supply of necessary medications for each member of the family don t forget survival items for your pets develop an evacuation plan an evacuation plan must be prepared in advance to be of use in developing one consider your family your workplace your school and your wider community if necessary begin to develop a community wide evacuation plan if nothing is being done in your community take the initiative to start developing the plan and involve local authorities and other residents lack of evacuation plans and local warning systems put you your family and your entire community at increased risk for injury or death during and after a tsunami these are the things that should be part of a successful evacuation plan discuss with family and colleagues the various options for evacuation know for example where you might reunite with your loved ones should a tsunami hit conduct practice drills to ensure that all members of the community are clear about what they need to do and where they need to go during a safety evacuation include a plan that can ensure a head count of every single member of the community ensure that assistance for disabled or ill persons can be provided ensure that warning and evacuation signals are understood by the community in advance distribute pamphlets or give lectures to ensure that everybody is aware read understand tsunami notification terms remember to provide multiple safety routes owing to the possibility of an earthquake destroying roads and other infrastructure preventing exit using some routes consider what types of sheltered areas might exist in the evacuation zones do such shelters need to be built in advance be especially careful after an earthquake if you live in a coastal zone the occurrence of an earthquake should be immediate cause for alarm and evasive action look out for a rapid rise and fall in coastal waters if the sea suddenly recedes draws back leaving bare sand this is a major warning sign that there is about to be a sudden surge of water inland notice any odd behavior changes in animals watch for animals leaving the area or behaving abnormally such as trying to seek human shelter or grouping together in ways they would not normally do 2 x research source heed community and government warnings if the local authorities do have time to issue a warning take heed inform yourself in advance of how the local authorities plan to make warnings so that you do not mistake or ignore the warning when it comes share that information with family friends neighbors and the community if the local authorities have pamphlets a website or other information sources ask for copies to distribute or request that the local authority fulfills this role abandon belongings if a tsunami hits save lives not possessions trying to retrieve things and belongings may hamper your escape by causing you to lose valuable time grab your safety pack something to keep you warm your family and leave immediately tsunami survivors act quickly and usually don t bother with trying to save possessions move inland and to high ground the first thing you should try to do if possible is to move away from the coast lagoons or other bodies of water towards higher ground and even into hills or mountains move until you are either 2 miles 3 2 km inland or 100 feet 30 m above sea level expect roads to be totally wiped out by a tsunami 3 x research source if you re planning on using roads to get where you need to go think again in a full blown tsunami many roads will be wiped out either by the seismic activity of the earthquake or by the tsunami itself have a good sense of the general direction you want to be heading in and consider keeping a compass in your survival pack climb an evacuation tower if you cannot head inland because you are trapped head up a tsunami evacuation tower is a tower designed to withstand a tsunami the walls of the tower are designed to break away allowing water to pass through while preventing large debris from toppling the tower if you cannot find an evacuation tower then climb a high rise although not ideal because the structure itself could collapse if this is your only option choose a high sturdy and solid building and climb up it go as high as you possibly can even onto the roof 4 x research source climb a sturdy tree as a very last resort if you find yourself trapped and unable to move inland or climb a high building find a strong and tall tree and climb up it as high as you can there is a risk of trees being dragged under by the tsunami however so this really is a measure to be used only if all other alternatives are impossible the stronger the tree the higher it stands and the sturdier its branches for resting on you may be there for hours the better your chances are of surviving 5 x research source react quickly if you are caught up in the water if you did not manage to evacuate but find yourself caught up in the tsunami for one reason or another there are things that you can do to try to survive grab onto something that floats use a floating object as a raft to keep yourself above the water items that float such as tree trunks doors fishing equipment etc may be in the water with you 6 x research source brace for aftershocks and additional waves a tsunami comes in waves there may be many many waves lasting for hours and the next wave may be even larger than the last 7 x research source try to get reliable information listen to the radio for updates on what is happening do not trust word of mouth it is better to wait than to return too early and be caught by more incoming waves wait for local authorities to issue an all clear only then you should return to your home find out in advance how local authorities propose to announce such a notice remember that roads may be extremely damaged by the tsunami waves and you may have to take alternative routes 8 x research source a good pre planned emergency plan should account for this possibility and provide alternative routes and gathering places know that survival continues after the tsunami has passed once the tsunami has subsided there will be debris destroyed buildings and broken infrastructure there may also be dead bodies fresh water supplies will be destroyed or disrupted food supplies will most likely be unavailable the potential for disease post traumatic stress disorder grief starvation and injuries will make the post tsunami period nearly as perilous as the tsunami itself an emergency plan should also consider the aftermath and what you ll need to do to protect yourself your family and your community rally the community behind a rehabilitation plan if your local authorities have not put action plans into place suggest that they do so or form a community action group to consider a post tsunami plan things that can help survival post tsunami include establishing an advance stash of fresh water whether bottled water or filtered water an emergency water supply should be in place in your community opening up undamaged homes and buildings to others help those in distress and provide them with shelter 9 x research source ensuring that there are power generators to enable cooking maintenance of hygiene and return of basic health and transportation services running emergency shelters and food distribution getting health care into action immediately quelling fires and gas ruptures,Home-and-Garden
how to react during an earthquake,earthquakes happen when the earth s crust shifts causing seismic waves to quake and crash up against one another unlike hurricanes or floods earthquakes come without warning and are usually followed by similar aftershocks although the aftershocks are usually less powerful than the quake if you find yourself in the middle of an earthquake there s often only a split second to decide what to do studying the following advice could be the difference between life and death,drop to the ground the drop cover and hold on technique is the cousin of the famous stop drop and roll for fires while it s not the only method of protecting yourself indoors during an earthquake it is the preferred method of the federal emergency management agency fema and the american red cross 1 x research source big earthquakes occur without much if any warning so it s recommended that you drop to the floor as soon as it hits a small earthquake could turn into a big earthquake in a split second it s better to be safe than sorry take cover get under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture if possible stay away from glass windows outside doors and walls and anything that could fall such as lighting fixtures or furniture if there isn t a table or desk near you cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building do not run outside you re more likely to get injured trying to get out of the building than staying put head for a doorway hiding under a doorway is a myth 2 x research source you re safer under a table than you are under a doorway especially in modern houses run to another room to get under a table or other piece of furniture stay inside until it s safe to get out researchers have shown that most injuries happen when people try to change the place of hiding or when the place is crowded and everyone has a goal to get outside safe hold on the ground may be shaking and debris could be falling hold on to whatever surface or platform you ve gotten under and wait for the shaking to subside if you were unable to find a surface to hide under continue to keep your head shielded by your arms and tucked down low stay in a safe place if you find yourself in bed while an earthquake strikes stay there hold on and protect your head with a pillow unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall in that case move to the nearest safe place many injuries are caused when people leave their bed and walk across broken glass with their bare feet 3 x research source remain inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside research suggests that many injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave be careful when you do go outside walk do not run in case of violent aftershocks collect yourself in an area without wires buildings or crevasses in the earth do not use elevators for egress the power can go out causing you to be trapped your best bet is to use the stairwell if it s free plus the elevator likely has a seismic mode which stops the elevator and renders itself inoperable after an earthquake use the triangle of life method this is an alternative to drop cover and hold on if you can t find a desk or a table to duck under you have options although this method is disputed 4 x research source 5 x research source by many of the world s leading earthquake safety officials it could save your life in the event that a building you re in collapses find a structure or piece of furniture nearby the triangle of life theory is that people who find shelter near not under household items such as sofas are often protected by voids or spaces created by a pancake collapse theoretically a collapsing building would fall on top of a sofa or desk crushing it but leaving a void nearby devotees of this theory suggest that sheltering in this void is the safest bet for earthquake survivors huddle in the fetal position next to the structure or piece of furniture doug copp the main proponent of the triangle of life theory says that this safety technique is natural for dogs and cats and can work for you too consider this list of what not to do in the event of an earthquake if you can t find a safe place to duck nearby cover your head and get into the fetal position wherever you are do not go under a doorway people under doorways are commonly crushed to death if the door jamb falls under the weight of the earthquake s impact go upstairs to get under a piece of furniture stairs and staircases are dangerous places to tread during an earthquake as they could collapse or break without notice know that the triangle of life method is unsupported by scientific findings and or expert consensus the triangle of life technique is controversial if you find yourself with several options about how to proceed during an earthquake indoors attempt the drop cover and hold technique there are several problems with the triangle of life technique first it s difficult to know where triangles of life form since objects in a quake move up and down as well as laterally second scientific studies tell us that most deaths in earthquakes are linked to falling debris and objects not falling structures 6 x research source the triangle of life is predominantly based on earthquakes that cause structures not objects to fall many scientists believe that it s also more likely to sustain injuries trying to move somewhere instead of staying put 7 x research source the triangle of life theory advocates moving to safe areas over staying put stay outdoors until the shaking stops don t try to heroically rescue someone or venture indoors your best bet is to stay outside where the risk of collapsing structures is diminished the greatest danger exists directly outside buildings at exits and alongside exterior walls stay away from buildings street lights and utility wires these are the main risks of being outdoors when an earthquake or one of its aftershocks is in progress stop as quickly as possible if you are in a vehicle and remain inside avoid stopping near or under buildings trees overpasses and utility wires proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped avoid roads bridges or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake 8 x research source stay calm if you are trapped under debris although it may seem counter intuitive waiting for help is probably your best bet if you find yourself trapped under immovable debris do not light a match or a lighter leaking gas or other flammable chemicals may accidentally light on fire do not move about or kick up dust cover your mouth with a handkerchief or piece of clothing tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you use a whistle if one is available shout only as a last resort shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust be prepared to face a possible tsunami if you are near a big body of water a tsunami happens when an earthquake causes an extreme underwater disturbance sending powerful waves towards shores and human habitation if there s just been an earthquake and its epicenter is in the ocean there s a good chance you ll have to be on the lookout for tsunamis,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare for an earthquake,an earthquake can be a very destructive natural disaster particularly in the pacific rim region after an earthquake your home may be a mess and you might be left without a water supply or power there are several things you can do to prepare for an earthquake before it happens to minimize the damage and potential for injury in and around your home,create a disaster preparedness plan for your house or place of work know what you and your family are going to do before the earthquake happens form your plan together and go over it on a regular basis the most important first step is understanding what to do the moment an earthquake hits 1 x research source this plan needs to identify the best places for cover in your building under sturdy desks and tables and inside strong interior door frames are good places if there is no other cover lay on the floor next to an interior wall and protect your head and neck stay away from large furniture mirrors external walls and windows kitchen cabinets and anything heavy that isn t bolted down teach everyone how to signal for help if trapped rescuers searching collapsed buildings will be listening for sounds so try knocking three times repeatedly or blow an emergency whistle if you have access to one 2 x research source practice until it is second nature practice this plan often you only have a few seconds to make adjustments in a real earthquake 3 x research source practice drop cover and hold on until it becomes second nature in a real earthquake this is your number one defense drop to the floor take cover under a sturdy desk or table and hold on firmly be prepared for shaking and falling objects you should practice this in every room of the house knowing your protected areas no matter where you are when an earthquake hits 4 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source if you are outside move into the open away from anything that could fall or collapse like telegraph poles and buildings drop and cover your head from falling objects stay there until the shaking stops 5 x research source learn basic first aid and cpr or make sure there is at least one person in the house knows it there are resources in your community to educate you and your family on how to deal with first aid emergencies your local red cross has monthly classes as well that will teach you the basic skills to deal with most common injuries and situations if you cannot attend a class purchase basic first aid books and put them with each stash of emergency supplies in the house having a first aid kit is highly recommended decide on a rallying point for your family for after the earthquake it should be away from buildings go over what your family should do in the event that not everyone makes it to the rallying point if you have civil defense safety meeting points as designated by your town be sure that every member of the family knows the location of the one closest to home school and work identify an out of area contact person like an out of state aunt or uncle that your family can call and get in touch with one another if you can t call each other for some reason make sure you call them to help coordinate a meet up use frs and gmrs service gmrs requires a license by fcc in us to contact each other phone lines get congested in disaster some frs and gmrs radio can send radio waves up to 40 miles learn how to turn off the utilities in your house especially the gas line a broken gas line leaks flammable gas into the environment which can lead to a very dangerous explosion if untended you should learn how to operate your utilities now so that in the event you smell leaking gas you can quickly stop the problem 6 x research source write down and share emergency contact lists this should include everyone in your home office etc you need to know who must be accounted for and how to get in touch with them if they can t be found in addition to normal contact information ask each person to provide and emergency contact as well 7 x research source you should also include names and numbers of neighbors name and number of the landlord important medical information emergency numbers for fire medical police and insurance 8 x research source try to develop routes and methods for getting home after an earthquake has occurred there is no way to know what time of day an earthquake might strike you may be at work at school on a bus or in a train when one strikes it is highly likely that you will need to know several ways to get home since roads and bridges will likely be obstructed for long periods of time note any potentially dangerous structures like bridges and figure out a route around them if need be prepare a disaster supply kit and inform the entire household of its location earthquakes can trap people in their homes for days at a time in the worst case scenario so you need everything for survival in the house if you have a large house or family more than 4 5 people consider making extra kits and leaving them in different sections of the house purchase enough emergency food and water for at least three days you should have a gallon of water for each family member plus a few more for emergencies make sure you have a manual can opener to get into tinned emergency rations as well you can purchase any non perishable food you prefer such as canned foods like fruits vegetables beans and tuna processed crackers and salty snacks camping food 9 x research source buy a solar or manual crank flashlight and radio or a normal flashlight with extra batteries you should preferably have one for each individual in the house get a portable battery operated radio as well there are some models that are solar or kinetically powered that may be worth an investment as you ll never have to worry about batteries you should also purchase glow sticks matches and candles as backup options create a first aid kit this is one of the most important objects in your emergency kit and needs to be fully stocked with the following 10 x research source bandages and gauze antibiotic ointments and alcohol wipes pain relievers broad spectrum antibiotic pills anti diarrhea medication essential to fight dehydration in an emergency scissors gloves and dust masks needle and thread splinting material compression wraps up to date prescriptions water purification tablets 11 x research source put together a basic tool kit that can help get out of the house in an emergency you may need to help rescue crews or move fallen debris trapping you in the house you should have wrenches for gas lines heavy duty hammer work gloves crowbar fire extinguisher rope ladder 12 x research source store miscellaneous supplies to make an emergency stay more comfortable while everything above is essential to a good survival kit the following materials should also be rounded up if time and money allow pillows and blankets closed toe shoes plastic bags disposable cutlery plates and cups emergency cash toiletries games cards toys and writing materials 13 x research source scanner it will be helpful to hear outside information on a scanner fasten any large items securely to the walls and floor there are a number of specific hazards in your home that you can deal with before an earthquake occurs the biggest danger is actually from falling objects inside your house luckily these sorts of injuries can be prevented with some forethought fasten all shelves securely to the walls 14 x research source use brackets to attach wall units bookcases and other tall furniture to wall studs standard steel brackets are fine and easy to apply place large heavy objects on lower shelves or on the floor they might fall during an earthquake and the less distance they have to fall the better you can also screw objects onto things such as a desk 15 x research source use non slip mats to prevent objects with a low center of gravity from sliding for example fish bowls vases floral arrangements statues etc use an invisible nylon cord to secure tall heavy items that can topple over to the wall place an eye screw in the wall and tie the thread around the object such as a vase and then tie it to the eye screw 16 x research source install shatter safe window films to protect from breaking glass in a last minute pinch placing masking tape across the diagonals in an x of your windows can keep them from shattering 17 x research source most earthquake prone areas will already require these windows but you should check to make sure place breakable items in closed cabinets that have latches lock or latch them up so that the cabinet doors cannot fly open use poster tack plastic putty to keep ornaments figurines and glassware adhered to shelves and mantelpieces there are even special commercial quake putties available allowing you to secure objects in place securely remove or secure hanging objects from above seating and sleeping areas heavy pictures light fixtures and mirrors should be hung away from beds couches and anywhere that someone might sit conventional picture hooks will not hold pictures during an earthquake but they are easy to fix simply push the hook closed or use a filler material to fill the gap between the hook and its backing 18 x research source other alternatives include buying special art hooks and ensuring that heavy paintings have adequate strong hooks and cord check that your house is up to date with earthquake protections a landlord or your local zoning board can help you determine this if you have any deep cracks in the ceiling or foundations repair these immediately you might need to consult an expert if there are signs of structural weakness make sure your foundation is properly braced and that all modern laws and building regulations are being complied with have flexible fittings placed on your gas pipes a professional plumber will need to do this it s also a good idea to have flexible fittings on your water pipes so have these fixed at the same time if your house has a chimney secure it to the walls of the house using galvanized metal angles and bands at the top ceiling line and base the angles can be bolted to the wall and to ceiling joists or rafters if you have cladding on the house for the part of the chimney sitting above the roof line brace it to the roof 19 x research source evaluate your electrical wiring electrical appliances and gas connections do any repairs if needed during an earthquake faulty fittings and wiring can become a potential fire hazard when securing appliances be sure not to drill holes in them you can use existing holes or make loops from leather that can be glued onto an appliance work with your community to prepare for earthquakes together if there aren t civic groups present in your area focused on earthquake preparedness work on creating one here you can share resources find meeting points and provide support for one another in the case of an earthquake,Home-and-Garden
how to survive an earthquake in your car,earthquakes are dangerous natural disasters that occur every year if you live in a region prone to earthquakes you might at some point find yourself in your car when one strikes depending on the circumstances this could present a variety of challenges to you ultimately by parking your car in a safe location reacting to the earthquake as it happens and preparing in advance with an earthquake survival kit you ll stand a better chance at surviving in your car,pull over to the shoulder if you re driving when the earthquake strikes you should pull over to the shoulder of the road in a quick and safe manner this is important as you don t want to be struck by other motorists who are trying to flee the area make sure to signal and or turn your hazard lights on if you are on an overpass wait until you are on solid ground before you stop 1 x research source look for a location where things can t fall on your vehicle as you re trying to pull over you should look around for a spot where your vehicle will be safe from falling debris if you re in the middle of a city you may not have many good options in this case you may just want to park your car in a place you are most comfortable with 2 x research source park your car away from expansion joints on an elevated highway if you find yourself driving on an elevated road during an earthquake find a safe location to park your vehicle away from the joints of the highway this is important as the concrete slabs of the highway could fall off their supports during the earthquake 3 x research source turn off your engine after you park your car you should turn the engine off immediately this is important as the earthquake could damage your vehicle or rupture the gas tank creating a situation where your car catches fire or even explodes 4 x research source put your emergency brake on once your engine is off put your emergency beak on your emergency break will help keep your car from rolling backwards or forwards if the ground becomes unlevel below the vehicle this is especially helpful if you re on a bridge or elevated road where your car could roll off 5 x research source switch on your radio once the worst of the earthquake has subsided turn your radio on and search for a news station the station will likely broadcast valuable information about the extent of the earthquake evacuation routes rescue efforts and instructions for people hurt or trapped by the event 6 x research source stay in the vehicle and assess the situation while you may be tempted to jump right out of the car after the earthquake is over unless it is an emergency you should stay a moment and look around if the earthquake was minor and you think you can safely drive away do so but be careful when assessing the situation pay attention to 7 x research source downed powerlines around you the condition of the road around you whether other people are getting out of their cars if you smell gasoline or natural gas whether your vehicle is damaged or not alert others if you need assistance if you are injured or trapped in your vehicle alert others immediately you can do this by waving to people shouting or using a noise making device from your survival kit with a little luck someone will quickly come to your aid get out of your car if you smell gasoline whether you are in the middle of an earthquake or afterwards you should exit your car immediately if you smell gasoline this is important as your car could potentially catch on fire or even explode 8 x research source leave your car if you hear a tsunami alert if you re near water and hear a tsunami alert you should leave your car and run at least 0 5 miles 0 80 km inland or at least 100 feet 30 m above sea level you ll likely be safer higher up than trying to flee in your vehicle if that is not an option then run to an evacuation tower these towers are located in low lying coastal areas where moving inland is impossible get as high as possible and be prepared to move further up the tower if the tower is at a public building note that the walls of the building are designed to break away to allow water to flow through but the tower will remain standing find a container to house your kit depending on the size of your car and what you choose to include you can pick from a number of receptacles to store your kit items the item you pick should be sturdy and big enough to hold everything you want in addition you should be able to organize your items in it some possible items include large buckets a cloth canvas grocery bag an old suitcase or a large plastic storage container depending on the size of your kit you ll probably have to store your water outside of it store water in your vehicle perhaps the most important element of your survival kit is drinking water if you find yourself trapped in your car it may be hours or even days until rescue workers reach you during that time you ll need water to survive pack as much as you can 9 x research source avoid storing water in your trunk as you may not be able to access it in some circumstances the closer and more accessible your water the better pack food into your kit include as much high calorie food in your survival kit as you can while space might be an issue chances are you can find food that takes up minimal space but has a lot of calories you may need the calories if you re stuck in your car for a prolonged period 10 x research source energy bars are a great option to include in your survival kit as they have a lot of calories and will last a long time include a foghorn or noise making device if you find yourself stuck in your car you may need to make noise to alert rescue workers in this case the louder your noise making device the better ultimately this is an essential piece of your car earthquake survival kit 11 x research source cover your ears or use ear plugs when you use your noise making device point the noise making device away from you and out a window if possible get a flash light if your vehicle is completely covered under rubble or debris it may be completely dark if this is the case you ll need a flash light to help determine your situation use other parts of your survival kit or to signal rescuers 12 x research source include extra batteries for your flash light expand your kit to include other items you think you need in addition to the basics there are many other items you might consider including in your kit these items include food communication items and first aid items view this list for more ideas on what to include,Home-and-Garden
how to act after an earthquake,the aftermath of an earthquake can be devastating but it s important that you are alert and focused after an earthquake strikes fires gas leaks and injury are all dangers you face after an earthquake and the more prepared you are to respond the safer you ll be by bracing for aftershocks assessing the safety of your location and following the directions of local authorities your chances of surviving the aftermath of an earthquake will be much higher,check yourself for injuries make sure you re not seriously hurt before you do anything if you re bleeding elevate your injury and put pressure on it if your injury is serious call for help using a cell phone or try to get rescuers attention 1 x research source signal for help if you re trapped use a cell phone to call for help if you have one if you can t use a phone try knocking loudly on something nearby until rescuers find you 2 x research source help others around you look to see if there s anyone trapped nearby or if someone needs medical attention if there s a first aid kit near you grab it and use it on minor injuries if someone is bleeding apply pressure to the wound and wrap the injury in gauze if you have some if someone has no pulse administer cpr if you encounter someone with substantial medical injuries seek professional medical assistance prepare for aftershocks aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock of an earthquake and they can cause significant damage expect aftershocks to occur and prepare to move to a safe location like an open outdoor space or a structurally sound building 3 x research source if an aftershock does occur drop to the ground cover yourself and hold on to something until the shaking stops put on sturdy shoes and clothes try to find a long sleeve shirt and pants so your body is protected from glass and debris if you have access to a hard hat goggles or a mask put those on too if you don t have access to shoes or clothes walk around debris and fallen objects to avoid hurting yourself 4 x research source exit the building once the shaking has stopped and you know it s safe the structure of the building you re in may have been weakened by the initial earthquake so you should exit in case of any aftershocks that could cause more damage to the building 5 x research source if you re in a high rise building after an earthquake hits do not use the elevators to exit slowly descend the stairs of the building and exit outside 6 x research source if you re in a stadium or theater exit the building calmly watching out for any debris that could fall on you 7 x research source stay put if you re outdoors following an earthquake do not enter any buildings unless they have been deemed safe by authorities buildings that look safe could be at risk of collapse if an aftershock occurs or falling debris inside could seriously injure you 8 x research source get to a wide open space once you re outside avoid standing near buildings or other large objects that could fall on you if an aftershock hits if you re near a coast head for high ground in case a tsunami forms after the earthquake 9 x research source call your family neighbors or a roommate if you have a cell phone find out if they re alright and what the status of your home is if you re not there make a plan and establish a place to meet find a local shelter if your home is unsafe to return to if you re not sure where the nearest shelter is ask an emergency official nearby or see if a neighbor knows do not re enter your home until you are certain that it is safe 10 x research source drive carefully traffic lights may not be working and there could be fallen debris on the road clear the way for any emergency response vehicles you encounter 11 x research source use a battery powered radio or television to listen to local emergency information follow the instructions of local officials and check in regularly for updates you can also check social media or cell phone alerts for further information from authorities 12 x research source extinguish any fires inside or outside your home if a fire is small enough put it out using water or a fire extinguisher if you have one available if you encounter a large fire contact the fire department or nearby emergency officials immediately prevent a fire from starting by unplugging broken lights and appliances don t light any matches or open flames until you re certain your home is safe 13 x research source smell for gas if you smell gas immediately turn off the gas valve the smell could indicate a gas leak which could cause an explosion or a fire 14 x research source inspect the electrical wiring in your home for any damage if there s damage immediately turn off the main breaker switch keep the power shut off until the electrical wiring is fixed and your home is deemed safe 15 x research source avoid chimneys and walls made of brick they re at high risk of collapsing after an earthquake never use your fireplace after an earthquake until it s been inspected by a professional and keep out of rooms with brick walls 16 x research source leave if your home is unsafe find an open outdoor space to go to or make plans to meet up with others take an emergency kit with you and leave a note in clear view detailing where you are 17 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to build a seawall,erosion poses a serious threat to any waterfront property owner although some waterfronts may come equipped with seawalls responsibility for the maintenance repair and replacement of seawalls often falls on the property owner seawalls are often built from stone concrete plastic membranes or other materials for a do it yourself seawall using wooden planks set by metal poles is your best choice you ll begin by making a series of measurements and arrangements move to on setting your poles and finally you will install your lumber and finish the job building a seawall is a big job and it will require the use of some heavy machinery,survey the area walk along the area where you intend to build your seawall carrying a tape measure notepad and pen use the tape measure to track the length you need to achieve use the pad and pen to sketch a rough outline of your shore taking special note of any changes in elevation or sharp curves finally use spray paint to mark off 8 2 43m intervals where you will place your poles 1 x research source track the high water mark once you know the exact location of your seawall you can use existing rocks posts or other landmarks to track the height of the water you must measure the high water mark for at least one month during the highest tide of the day this data will determine how high your seawall needs to be the wall described here will be 2 60 96cm above ground research local regulations depending on the body of water you are building on as well as the county state and or country you find yourself in there may be regulations governing what you can build in some cases you may need to obtain a permit or have the area inspected before you can begin contact your local town city or county offices to determine the rules for building a seawall in your area if necessary obtain the proper permits 2 x research source gather supplies to build this seawall you are going to need some supplies as well as some heavy machinery the exact amounts you need will vary depending on the length of your seawall all supplies can be purchased at a home improvement store look for a heavy machinery rental location near you you will need metal pipes 4 long 1 21m 3 7 62cm diameter one every 8 2 43m 2 x 12 5 08 x 2 54cm treated lumber 10 long 3 04m 2 boards between each set of poles threaded rebar 4 10 25 4cm pieces per metal pipe quick drying concrete galvanized nuts and washers 8 sets per metal pipe circular saw drill jackhammer prepare metal pipes to begin you are going to need to weld 4 pieces of u shaped rebar onto each of your metal pipes with the pipe fitting in to the u you can weld these yourself or take them to a shop 3 x research source the first piece of rebar should be 4 10 16cm from the top of the pipe the second piece should 4 10 16cm below that the third should be 8 20 32cm below the fourth should be 4 10 16cm inches below dig holes digging the holes can be the most challenging part depending on the material you will be digging into each hole needs to be at least 2 60 96 deep and 10 25 4cm wide use a jackhammer to dig one hole for each metal post 4 x research source if you do not have experience using a jackhammer it is best to hire someone to help you set poles position each of your poles into the holes that have been dug for them using a level try to make sure that your posts are even and uniform with one another use your jackhammer to adjust the depth of the holes if need be 5 x research source pour concrete once your poles are properly positioned pour enough quick drying cement to completely fill each hole allow 24 hours for the concrete to set 6 x research source if your holes are filled with water you will need to use a sub pump or simply a bucket to remove the water before adding concrete cutting your lumber now you will measure and cut your boards your wooden boards are 10 3 04m long you will 2 of these to fill each approximately 2 x 8 60 96 x 243 8cm space between each set of poles 7 x research source you metal poles are all 4 1 21m long with half of each buried in the ground it will require 2 2 x12 5 08 x 2 54cm boards to fill this space use a circular saw to cut these boards originally 10 3 04m long to the proper length approximately 8 2 43m even though you set your poles 8 2 43m apart it is important to measure each space and each board individually before cutting changes in the shoreline can cause discrepancies drill holes for rebar now you will line up each board with each set of poles and mark the locations where you will drill holes for the rebar to pass through each board will have 2 holes drilled on either side once again be sure to specifically measure each board to each piece of rebar before you drill install boards fit the boards onto the poles by sliding each piece of rebar into the hole that has been drilled for it this is not so easy and will require at least 2 people install your lumber so that it is flush with the post then twist a nut and washer onto each piece of rebar to secure it 8 x research source you may need to bend or reposition the rebar in order to make it fit through the holes in your lumber you can accomplish this by sliding a 2 foot piece of hollow conduit over each piece of rebar using it to bend the rebar to fit at the end of the project you may want to remove excess rebar with a reciprocating saw fill in the land side fill in the land side of your seawall with rocks and large gravel to allow for adequate drainage cover these rocks with sand and finally finish with a layer of topsoil 9 x research source maintaining your seawall it is an excellent idea to provide annual maintenance to your existing seawall look for broken cracked or rotten boards remove the nuts remove the boards and replace them with fresh wood your metal posts should remain in tact for 5 or more years if they become loose they may need to be replaced as well,Home-and-Garden
how to know when an earthquake will strike,there is no proven way to predict an earthquake geologists are working to develop an early warning system but there is still much to be learned about what happens just before an earthquake hits part of the problem is that earthquakes don t always behave in a consistent way some signs occur at different times days weeks or seconds before the event whereas sometimes those signs do not occur at all read on to learn possible signs of an earthquake and how to be prepared should you experience an earthquake,watch for reports of earthquake lights days or mere seconds before an earthquake people have observed strange lights from the ground or hovering in the air 1 x research source though they are not fully understood earthquake lights may be emitted from rocks that are under extreme stress 2 x research source earthquake lights have not been reported before all earthquakes nor has the timing been consistent but if you hear about strange lights or talk of ufo in your area you may want to go over your earthquake preparedness plan and make sure your emergency survival kit is stocked 3 x research source earthquake lights have been observed as short blue flames coming up from the ground as orbs of light that float in the air or as huge forks of light that look like lightening shooting up from the ground 4 x research source observe unusual changes in animal behavior there are reports of animals from toads 5 x research source to bees to birds and bears abandoning their homes or breeding grounds just before an earthquake it is not understood why animals may sense an oncoming event possibly because of changes in the electric field or responding to the p wave but noticing strange behavior in your pet may give you a heads up that something is about to happen 6 x research source chickens may stop laying eggs before an earthquake if you notice your hens stop laying eggs for no reason make sure you and your family know what to do in case of an earthquake catfish respond violently to changes in electric fields which may occur before an earthquake if you are fishing and see a ton of catfish suddenly thrashing around it is possible an earthquake is on the way look around for a safe place away from trees or bridges that might fall on you 7 x research source dogs cats and other animals can feel an earthquake seconds before it can be detected by humans if your pet begins acting nervous and erratic becomes frightened of seemingly nothing and runs to hide or if your normally calm dog begins to bite and bark you may want to look around for a place to take cover dogs will also howl a lot and loud if there is an earthquake notice possible foreshocks smaller earthquakes that lead up to the main earthquake though foreshocks may not always occur before an earthquake and it is impossible to tell which earthquake is the main quake until after the fact earthquakes tend to happen in clusters 8 x research source if you experience one or more small earthquakes there may be another bigger earthquake on the way 9 x research source because it is impossible to predict how long an earthquake will last or its magnitude when you feel the ground begin to roll take the appropriate actions to protect yourself from falling debris depending on where you are indoors outdoors in your car investigate the seismic cycle of any faults in your area though there is no way to pinpoint the exact arrival of an earthquake scientists can examine sediment samples to get an idea of when major earthquakes occurred in the past by measuring the amount of time between events they can come up with a rough idea of when a major quake might hit 10 x research source cycles can stretch for hundreds of years it may be 600 years or more or less between major earthquakes along a fault but there s no way to truly know if or when the next big quake will occur 11 x research source if the nearest fault line still has 250 years in its cycle before another big earthquake allow that to give you some solace but do remember that there are no hard and fast rules for predicting earthquakes so you should have an emergency kit prepared just in case 12 x research source participate in an earthquake early warning program right now japan mexico and california are the only areas that provide official earthquake early warnings though research is being conducted to expand these systems to include places near fault lines even with systems in place they can only provide tens of seconds of advance warning before an earthquake 13 x research source there are however services that will send you text messages alerting you of natural disaster occurrences or warnings in your area including earthquakes these alert messages can provide you with instructions in an emergency including evacuation routes and available emergency shelters your city may have a warning system in place such a sirens followed by a warning or instructions make sure you know if your town or city has such a warning system 14 x research source check an earthquake tracking website not sure if that rumbling you felt was a big truck outside or construction or even just a weird dream you can verify earthquakes online with tracking websites such as usgs and apps such as myshake which will show you where and when any earthquakes were recorded and the magnitude of each quake assemble a survival kit for your home and car if there is an earthquake you may lose power and cell service access to clean water food and medication putting together a survival kit will ensure your family has their basic needs covered should anything happen 15 x research source for your home try to have enough supplies for up to 2 weeks this means 1 gallon of water per person for each day non perishable foods and a can opener if they are in cans medications for each day bottles and diapers for babies and hygiene products 16 x research source vehicle survival kits should include maps jumper cables enough water for at least 3 days 1 gallon per person per day non perishable foods blankets flashlights 17 x research source don t forget your pets make sure you have water food bowls medication a leash and collar or carrier for your furry friends 18 x research source check out a more extensive list of items on the red cross website or ready gov secure large heavy or tall furniture by bolting it to the wall one of the biggest dangers of an earthquake is unstable buildings and the things inside the buildings that can fall and crush you 19 x research source anchoring heavy furniture to the wall will make your home much safer if there is an earthquake bookshelves wardrobes armoires hutches and china cabinets are all examples of furniture that should be bolted to the wall 20 x research source mirrors and flat screen tvs should also be secured to the wall so that they can t fall off and shatter don t hang them over couches or beds 21 x research source practice drop cover and hold on contrary to popular belief a door frame is not the safest place to be in an earthquake you want to drop to your knees so the quake doesn t knock you over cover the back of your head and neck with your arms or if you can safely crawl under a solid table or desk do so and then hold on to one of the legs so you move along with it 22 x research source you may only have a few seconds to act and practicing will allow you to react faster 23 x research source if there is no cover try to get to an inside corner of the room and get low to the ground 24 x research source if you are outdoors try to get to an open area away from buildings live wires and other things that might fall on you and drop cover and hold on 25 x research source if you are in a city it may be safer to go inside and find cover 26 x research source if you are in a vehicle get out from under any bridges or overpasses stay in the car and come to a stop as soon as possible avoiding buildings trees or wires that might fall on your car 27 x research source make sure your family has a communication plan agree upon where you will meet if there is an emergency learn important phone numbers like your parents work and cell phone numbers 28 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source choose a person who lives in another town or state as a contact it is sometimes easier to reach someone who is not in the disaster area if you are separated from your family this person can relay your location and that you are safe 29 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to

how to survive an earthquake,earthquakes strike without or with limited warning and are among the most destructive natural disasters to ride out an earthquake remember the phrase drop cover and hold on quickly find a spot away from glass exterior walls and any objects that could fall crouch and take cover until the shaking stops then respond to any hazardous damage caused by the earthquake advanced preparation is key so you and your family should make a supply kit come up with an emergency plan and practice drills regularly 1 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source,remember that you only have a few seconds between an earthquake warning and feeling actual shaking you may feel shaking before or after receiving such a warning you may even feel shaking with no warning regardless remember that earthquake early warnings give you limited time and do not predict earthquakes turn off cooking appliances if it is safe to do so before taking cover these appliances can potentially start a fire if left unattended make sure all controls on stoves ovens and microwaves are set to off before seeking cover open exit doors if you can before tremors start this will prevent them from jamming leaving you with a possible evacuation route follow instructions of emergency personnel if in a public building they may provide you additional things that you need to do to protect your lives for example they may inform you to turn off dangerous machinery or to move away from shelves or displays slow down your vehicle if in a car avoid sudden braking or swerving as it could potentially cause an accident get away from glass large furniture and other hazards if

how to survive a tsunami,a tsunami is a series of destructive and dangerous waves that result from earthquake activity or some other type of underwater disturbance in recent years tsunamis have caused an incredible amount of damage in order to survive a tsunami you must be prepared vigilant and calm this article sets out steps that can help you to survive a tsunami provided you learn and act upon these steps in advance to keep you and your family safe,learn about the potential for danger in advance it is important to consider whether or not you live somewhere that could potentially face a tsunami it is likely that you are at some risk if your home school or workplace is in a coastal region near the sea the elevation of your home school or workplace is at sea level or fairly low and on flat or only slightly undulating land if you don t know the elevation level of your home school or workplace find out some local authorities use elevation as a warning indicator there are warning signs indicating that your area is prone to tsunamis your local authorities have issued information about the potential for tsunamis natural sea barriers such as levees of dunes have been removed for development be aware if tsunamis have struck your coastal region in the past do some library research or ask at the local government office fema has a website enabling online flood risk searches 1 x research source most tsunamis happen in what s called the ring of fire an area in the pacific ocean known for its geologic activity chile the western united states japan and the philippines are especially vulnerable prepare essential materials in an easy to obtain location if a tsunami or another natural disaster hits chances are you ll need a few survival items and you ll need them fast it can be helpful to have both a safety and survival pack already assembled make a safety pack food water and a first aid kit are among the basics required keep the safety pack somewhere obvious well known to everyone in the building and easy to grab in an emergency it can also help to leave a raincoat or other coat for each person near the safety pack make a personal survival pack for each person in the family and a family survival pack with common items for everyone include a supply of necessary medications for each member of the family don t forget survival items for your pets develop an evacuation plan an evacuation plan must be prepared in advance to be of use in developing one consider your family your workplace your school and your wider community if necessary begin to develop a community wide evacuation plan if nothing is being done in your community take the initiative to start developing the plan and involve local authorities and other residents lack of evacuation plans and local warning systems put you your family and your entire community at increased risk for injury or death during and after a tsunami these are the things that should be part of a successful evacuation plan discuss with family and colleagues the various options for evacuation know for example where you might reunite with your loved ones should a tsunami hit conduct practice drills to ensure that all members of the community are clear about what they need to do and where they need to go during a safety evacuation include a plan that can ensure a head count of every single member of the community ensure that assistance for disabled or ill persons can be provided ensure that warning and evacuation signals are understood by the community in advance distribute pamphlets or give lectures to ensure that everybody is aware read understand tsunami notification terms remember to provide multiple safety routes owing to the possibility of an earthquake destroying roads and other infrastructure preventing exit using some routes consider what types of sheltered areas might exist in the evacuation zones do such shelters need to be built in advance be especially careful after an earthquake if you live in a coastal zone the occurrence of an earthquake should be immediate cause for alarm and evasive action look out for a rapid rise and fall in coastal waters if the sea suddenly recedes draws back leaving bare sand this is a major warning sign that there is about to be a sudden surge of water inland notice any odd behavior changes in animals watch for animals leaving the area or behaving abnormally such as trying to seek human shelter or grouping together in ways they would not normally do 2 x research source heed community and government warnings if the local authorities do have time to issue a warning take heed inform yourself in advance of how the local authorities plan to make warnings so that you do not mistake or ignore the warning when it comes share that information with family friends neighbors and the community if the local authorities have pamphlets a website or other information sources ask for copies to distribute or request that the local authority fulfills this role abandon belongings if a tsunami hits save lives not possessions trying to retrieve things and belongings may hamper your escape by causing you to lose valuable time grab your safety pack something to keep you warm your family and leave immediately tsunami survivors act quickly and usually don t bother with trying to save possessions move inland and to high ground the first thing you should try to do if possible is to move away from the coast lagoons or other bodies of water towards higher ground and even into hills or mountains move until you are either 2 miles 3 2 km inland or 100 feet 30 m above sea level expect roads to be totally wiped out by a tsunami 3 x research source if you re planning on using roads to get where you need to go think again in a full blown tsunami many roads will be wiped out either by the seismic activity of the earthquake or by the tsunami itself have a good sense of the general direction you want to be heading in and consider keeping a compass in your survival pack climb an evacuation tower if you cannot head inland because you are trapped head up a tsunami evacuation tower is a tower designed to withstand a tsunami the walls of the tower are designed to break away allowing water to pass through while preventing large debris from toppling the tower if you cannot find an evacuation tower then climb a high rise although not ideal because the structure itself could collapse if this is your only option choose a high sturdy and solid building and climb up it go as high as you possibly can even onto the roof 4 x research source climb a sturdy tree as a very last resort if you find yourself trapped and unable to move inland or climb a high building find a strong and tall tree and climb up it as high as you can there is a risk of trees being dragged under by the tsunami however so this really is a measure to be used only if all other alternatives are impossible the stronger the tree the higher it stands and the sturdier its branches for resting on you may be there for hours the better your chances are of surviving 5 x research source react quickly if you are caught up in the water if you did not manage to evacuate but find yourself caught up in the tsunami for one reason or another there are things that you can do to try to survive grab onto something that floats use a floating object as a raft to keep yourself above the water items that float such as tree trunks doors fishing equipment etc may be in the water with you 6 x research source brace for aftershocks and additional waves a tsunami comes in waves there may be many many waves lasting for hours and the next wave may be even larger than the last 7 x research source try to get reliable information listen to the radio for updates on what is happening do not trust word of mouth it is better to wait than to return too early and be caught by more incoming waves wait for local authorities to issue an all clear only then you should return to your home find out in advance how local authorities propose to announce such a notice remember that roads may be extremely damaged by the tsunami waves and you may have to take alternative routes 8 x research source a good pre planned emergency plan should account for this possibility and provide alternative routes and gathering places know that survival continues after the tsunami has passed once the tsunami has subsided there will be debris destroyed buildings and broken infrastructure there may also be dead bodies fresh water supplies will be destroyed or disrupted food supplies will most likely be unavailable the potential for disease post traumatic stress disorder grief starvation and injuries will make the post tsunami period nearly as perilous as the tsunami itself an emergency plan should also consider the aftermath and what you ll need to do to protect yourself your family and your community rally the community behind a rehabilitation plan if your local authorities have not put action plans into place suggest that they do so or form a community action group to consider a post tsunami plan things that can help survival post tsunami include establishing an advance stash of fresh water whether bottled water or filtered water an emergency water supply should be in place in your community opening up undamaged homes and buildings to others help those in distress and provide them with shelter 9 x research source ensuring that there are power generators to enable cooking maintenance of hygiene and return of basic health and transportation services running emergency shelters and food distribution getting health care into action immediately quelling fires and gas ruptures,Home-and-Garden
how to react during an earthquake,earthquakes happen when the earth s crust shifts causing seismic waves to quake and crash up against one another unlike hurricanes or floods earthquakes come without warning and are usually followed by similar aftershocks although the aftershocks are usually less powerful than the quake if you find yourself in the middle of an earthquake there s often only a split second to decide what to do studying the following advice could be the difference between life and death,drop to the ground the drop cover and hold on technique is the cousin of the famous stop drop and roll for fires while it s not the only method of protecting yourself indoors during an earthquake it is the preferred method of the federal emergency management agency fema and the american red cross 1 x research source big earthquakes occur without much if any warning so it s recommended that you drop to the floor as soon as it hits a small earthquake could turn into a big earthquake in a split second it s better to be safe than sorry take cover get under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture if possible stay away from glass windows outside doors and walls and anything that could fall such as lighting fixtures or furniture if there isn t a table or desk near you cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building do not run outside you re more likely to get injured trying to get out of the building than staying put head for a doorway hiding under a doorway is a myth 2 x research source you re safer under a table than you are under a doorway especially in modern houses run to another room to get under a table or other piece of furniture stay inside until it s safe to get out researchers have shown that most injuries happen when people try to change the place of hiding or when the place is crowded and everyone has a goal to get outside safe hold on the ground may be shaking and debris could be falling hold on to whatever surface or platform you ve gotten under and wait for the shaking to subside if you were unable to find a surface to hide under continue to keep your head shielded by your arms and tucked down low stay in a safe place if you find yourself in bed while an earthquake strikes stay there hold on and protect your head with a pillow unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall in that case move to the nearest safe place many injuries are caused when people leave their bed and walk across broken glass with their bare feet 3 x research source remain inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside research suggests that many injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave be careful when you do go outside walk do not run in case of violent aftershocks collect yourself in an area without wires buildings or crevasses in the earth do not use elevators for egress the power can go out causing you to be trapped your best bet is to use the stairwell if it s free plus the elevator likely has a seismic mode which stops the elevator and renders itself inoperable after an earthquake use the triangle of life method this is an alternative to drop cover and hold on if you can t find a desk or a table to duck under you have options although this method is disputed 4 x research source 5 x research source by many of the world s leading earthquake safety officials it could save your life in the event that a building you re in collapses find a structure or piece of furniture nearby the triangle of life theory is that people who find shelter near not under household items such as sofas are often protected by voids or spaces created by a pancake collapse theoretically a collapsing building would fall on top of a sofa or desk crushing it but leaving a void nearby devotees of this theory suggest that sheltering in this void is the safest bet for earthquake survivors huddle in the fetal position next to the structure or piece of furniture doug copp the main proponent of the triangle of life theory says that this safety technique is natural for dogs and cats and can work for you too consider this list of what not to do in the event of an earthquake if you can t find a safe place to duck nearby cover your head and get into the fetal position wherever you are do not go under a doorway people under doorways are commonly crushed to death if the door jamb falls under the weight of the earthquake s impact go upstairs to get under a piece of furniture stairs and staircases are dangerous places to tread during an earthquake as they could collapse or break without notice know that the triangle of life method is unsupported by scientific findings and or expert consensus the triangle of life technique is controversial if you find yourself with several options about how to proceed during an earthquake indoors attempt the drop cover and hold technique there are several problems with the triangle of life technique first it s difficult to know where triangles of life form since objects in a quake move up and down as well as laterally second scientific studies tell us that most deaths in earthquakes are linked to falling debris and objects not falling structures 6 x research source the triangle of life is predominantly based on earthquakes that cause structures not objects to fall many scientists believe that it s also more likely to sustain injuries trying to move somewhere instead of staying put 7 x research source the triangle of life theory advocates moving to safe areas over staying put stay outdoors until the shaking stops don t try to heroically rescue someone or venture indoors your best bet is to stay outside where the risk of collapsing structures is diminished the greatest danger exists directly outside buildings at exits and alongside exterior walls stay away from buildings street lights and utility wires these are the main risks of being outdoors when an earthquake or one of its aftershocks is in progress stop as quickly as possible if you are in a vehicle and remain inside avoid stopping near or under buildings trees overpasses and utility wires proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped avoid roads bridges or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake 8 x research source stay calm if you are trapped under debris although it may seem counter intuitive waiting for help is probably your best bet if you find yourself trapped under immovable debris do not light a match or a lighter leaking gas or other flammable chemicals may accidentally light on fire do not move about or kick up dust cover your mouth with a handkerchief or piece of clothing tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you use a whistle if one is available shout only as a last resort shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust be prepared to face a possible tsunami if you are near a big body of water a tsunami happens when an earthquake causes an extreme underwater disturbance sending powerful waves towards shores and human habitation if there s just been an earthquake and its epicenter is in the ocean there s a good chance you ll have to be on the lookout for tsunamis,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare for an earthquake,an earthquake can be a very destructive natural disaster particularly in the pacific rim region after an earthquake your home may be a mess and you might be left without a water supply or power there are several things you can do to prepare for an earthquake before it happens to minimize the damage and potential for injury in and around your home,create a disaster preparedness plan for your house or place of work know what you and your family are going to do before the earthquake happens form your plan together and go over it on a regular basis the most important first step is understanding what to do the moment an earthquake hits 1 x research source this plan needs to identify the best places for cover in your building under sturdy desks and tables and inside strong interior door frames are good places if there is no other cover lay on the floor next to an interior wall and protect your head and neck stay away from large furniture mirrors external walls and windows kitchen cabinets and anything heavy that isn t bolted down teach everyone how to signal for help if trapped rescuers searching collapsed buildings will be listening for sounds so try knocking three times repeatedly or blow an emergency whistle if you have access to one 2 x research source practice until it is second nature practice this plan often you only have a few seconds to make adjustments in a real earthquake 3 x research source practice drop cover and hold on until it becomes second nature in a real earthquake this is your number one defense drop to the floor take cover under a sturdy desk or table and hold on firmly be prepared for shaking and falling objects you should practice this in every room of the house knowing your protected areas no matter where you are when an earthquake hits 4 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source if you are outside move into the open away from anything that could fall or collapse like telegraph poles and buildings drop and cover your head from falling objects stay there until the shaking stops 5 x research source learn basic first aid and cpr or make sure there is at least one person in the house knows it there are resources in your community to educate you and your family on how to deal with first aid emergencies your local red cross has monthly classes as well that will teach you the basic skills to deal with most common injuries and situations if you cannot attend a class purchase basic first aid books and put them with each stash of emergency supplies in the house having a first aid kit is highly recommended decide on a rallying point for your family for after the earthquake it should be away from buildings go over what your family should do in the event that not everyone makes it to the rallying point if you have civil defense safety meeting points as designated by your town be sure that every member of the family knows the location of the one closest to home school and work identify an out of area contact person like an out of state aunt or uncle that your family can call and get in touch with one another if you can t call each other for some reason make sure you call them to help coordinate a meet up use frs and gmrs service gmrs requires a license by fcc in us to contact each other phone lines get congested in disaster some frs and gmrs radio can send radio waves up to 40 miles learn how to turn off the utilities in your house especially the gas line a broken gas line leaks flammable gas into the environment which can lead to a very dangerous explosion if untended you should learn how to operate your utilities now so that in the event you smell leaking gas you can quickly stop the problem 6 x research source write down and share emergency contact lists this should include everyone in your home office etc you need to know who must be accounted for and how to get in touch with them if they can t be found in addition to normal contact information ask each person to provide and emergency contact as well 7 x research source you should also include names and numbers of neighbors name and number of the landlord important medical information emergency numbers for fire medical police and insurance 8 x research source try to develop routes and methods for getting home after an earthquake has occurred there is no way to know what time of day an earthquake might strike you may be at work at school on a bus or in a train when one strikes it is highly likely that you will need to know several ways to get home since roads and bridges will likely be obstructed for long periods of time note any potentially dangerous structures like bridges and figure out a route around them if need be prepare a disaster supply kit and inform the entire household of its location earthquakes can trap people in their homes for days at a time in the worst case scenario so you need everything for survival in the house if you have a large house or family more than 4 5 people consider making extra kits and leaving them in different sections of the house purchase enough emergency food and water for at least three days you should have a gallon of water for each family member plus a few more for emergencies make sure you have a manual can opener to get into tinned emergency rations as well you can purchase any non perishable food you prefer such as canned foods like fruits vegetables beans and tuna processed crackers and salty snacks camping food 9 x research source buy a solar or manual crank flashlight and radio or a normal flashlight with extra batteries you should preferably have one for each individual in the house get a portable battery operated radio as well there are some models that are solar or kinetically powered that may be worth an investment as you ll never have to worry about batteries you should also purchase glow sticks matches and candles as backup options create a first aid kit this is one of the most important objects in your emergency kit and needs to be fully stocked with the following 10 x research source bandages and gauze antibiotic ointments and alcohol wipes pain relievers broad spectrum antibiotic pills anti diarrhea medication essential to fight dehydration in an emergency scissors gloves and dust masks needle and thread splinting material compression wraps up to date prescriptions water purification tablets 11 x research source put together a basic tool kit that can help get out of the house in an emergency you may need to help rescue crews or move fallen debris trapping you in the house you should have wrenches for gas lines heavy duty hammer work gloves crowbar fire extinguisher rope ladder 12 x research source store miscellaneous supplies to make an emergency stay more comfortable while everything above is essential to a good survival kit the following materials should also be rounded up if time and money allow pillows and blankets closed toe shoes plastic bags disposable cutlery plates and cups emergency cash toiletries games cards toys and writing materials 13 x research source scanner it will be helpful to hear outside information on a scanner fasten any large items securely to the walls and floor there are a number of specific hazards in your home that you can deal with before an earthquake occurs the biggest danger is actually from falling objects inside your house luckily these sorts of injuries can be prevented with some forethought fasten all shelves securely to the walls 14 x research source use brackets to attach wall units bookcases and other tall furniture to wall studs standard steel brackets are fine and easy to apply place large heavy objects on lower shelves or on the floor they might fall during an earthquake and the less distance they have to fall the better you can also screw objects onto things such as a desk 15 x research source use non slip mats to prevent objects with a low center of gravity from sliding for example fish bowls vases floral arrangements statues etc use an invisible nylon cord to secure tall heavy items that can topple over to the wall place an eye screw in the wall and tie the thread around the object such as a vase and then tie it to the eye screw 16 x research source install shatter safe window films to protect from breaking glass in a last minute pinch placing masking tape across the diagonals in an x of your windows can keep them from shattering 17 x research source most earthquake prone areas will already require these windows but you should check to make sure place breakable items in closed cabinets that have latches lock or latch them up so that the cabinet doors cannot fly open use poster tack plastic putty to keep ornaments figurines and glassware adhered to shelves and mantelpieces there are even special commercial quake putties available allowing you to secure objects in place securely remove or secure hanging objects from above seating and sleeping areas heavy pictures light fixtures and mirrors should be hung away from beds couches and anywhere that someone might sit conventional picture hooks will not hold pictures during an earthquake but they are easy to fix simply push the hook closed or use a filler material to fill the gap between the hook and its backing 18 x research source other alternatives include buying special art hooks and ensuring that heavy paintings have adequate strong hooks and cord check that your house is up to date with earthquake protections a landlord or your local zoning board can help you determine this if you have any deep cracks in the ceiling or foundations repair these immediately you might need to consult an expert if there are signs of structural weakness make sure your foundation is properly braced and that all modern laws and building regulations are being complied with have flexible fittings placed on your gas pipes a professional plumber will need to do this it s also a good idea to have flexible fittings on your water pipes so have these fixed at the same time if your house has a chimney secure it to the walls of the house using galvanized metal angles and bands at the top ceiling line and base the angles can be bolted to the wall and to ceiling joists or rafters if you have cladding on the house for the part of the chimney sitting above the roof line brace it to the roof 19 x research source evaluate your electrical wiring electrical appliances and gas connections do any repairs if needed during an earthquake faulty fittings and wiring can become a potential fire hazard when securing appliances be sure not to drill holes in them you can use existing holes or make loops from leather that can be glued onto an appliance work with your community to prepare for earthquakes together if there aren t civic groups present in your area focused on earthquake preparedness work on creating one here you can share resources find meeting points and provide support for one another in the case of an earthquake,Home-and-Garden
how to survive a tsunami for kids,when an earthquake occurs or a volcano erupts under water the waves travel like ripples on a pond after you throw a rock causing a tsunami the waves can be very tall move very quickly and cause great damage when they strike land while they can be very dangerous the good news is that truly destructive tsunamis don t occur that often and there s usually advance warning so there s plenty of time to evacuate if you re worried about a tsunami though learning how to prepare yourself your family and your friends just in case one ever occurs can help you feel better,determine how at risk your home is during a tsunami low lying areas near the ocean are extremely vulnerable to the waves you should know how at risk your family is before a disaster occurs so you know how to prepare your parents will probably know if your home is a tsunami hazard area but you should also know how high your street is above sea level and how far your neighborhood is from the coast and other areas where waves may occur those numbers usually help officials decide if you need to evacuate during a tsunami 1 x research source if you re not sure whether you live in an area that is at risk for a tsunami visit your local emergency management department s website there is usually a map or search engine that allows you to put in your address to determine if you re in a tsunami evacuation zone even if your home is safe other areas that you visit regularly may be in danger during a tsunami find out how far above sea level and how far from the coast your school is your parents should know that information about the places they work too while any area near an ocean coast can experience a tsunami they usually occur most often in the pacific ocean because of the fault lines beneath the ocean there 2 x research source on average only two tsunamis occur each year and they only affect the area around the source large tsunamis that cause ocean wide destruction occur much less frequently 3 x research source build an emergency kit hopefully you ll never have to worry about a tsunami or other natural disasters but being prepared is the best way to keep yourself safe talk to your family about creating an emergency kit so if you are trapped during a tsunami you have everything you need such as food water and medical supplies to survive for several days place the items in an easy to carry container a duffle bag camping backpack or unused trash can work well your kit should have 3 gallons of water per person per day for evacuating it should be 3 days worth in case you re trapped in your home it should be 2 weeks worth 4 x research source pack the kit with non perishable food that s easy to prepare such as canned beans have a 3 day supply for evacuation and 2 weeks worth for your home make sure your kit has at least one flashlight and a battery operated radio to keep up with news reports add fresh batteries to the kit as well in case of injuries it s important to have a first aid kit in your emergency supplies for minor injuries however if anyone in your family has special medical needs such as medications eyeglasses or syringes there should be a supply of those as well make sure there are enough to get through at least a week if you have a baby sibling check that the kit includes diapers baby food and formula if you have a pet in your family you ll need items such as a collar leash pet food and bowls your kit should have a multipurpose tool with features such as a can opener communication devices come in handy in an emergency kit add a cell phone with charger and or two way radios you may not have access to clean running water during and after a tsunami but include personal hygiene products such as toothpaste toothbrushes and deodorant make sure to add several rolls of toilet paper as well emergency blankets sleeping bags rain gear and changes of clothing for everyone in the family are also important include maps of your area in the kit so if you get confused about where your family should evacuate to you have a guide you may be stuck in your home at a shelter or some other evacuation location for a while during a tsunami pack some games books and other activities for you and your siblings in the kit to help keep you busy during the disaster plan an evacuation route if you live in a low lying area you likely can t stay at your home when a tsunami hits that s why your family must plan an evacuation route so you know how to leave your home safely and reach higher ground your family should choose a destination that s 100 feet 30 meters above sea level and approximately 2 miles 3 kilometers inland make sure that everyone in the family knows how to get there including the specific route to take 5 x research source to be sure that everyone is ready practice the evacuation route several times a year practicing means you won t have to think as much during an actual tsunami because you ll know exactly what to do if your family is taking a trip to a location that is prone to tsunamis have your parents check with the hotel or resort to determine what the evacuation policy is for guests during a disaster know your school s evacuation plan it s possible that you may be at school when a tsunami hits so you should pay careful attention when teachers and other school official go over the evacuation policy that way you ll know where to go and how to leave the school safely 6 x research source during a tsunami evacuation roads are going to be crowded and it may be difficult to get in touch with your parents make sure they know whether they should pick you up at your school at an emergency shelter or another location create a family communications plan during a tsunami phone lines may be down or overloaded so it s important for your family to develop a way to get in touch with one another in case you re separated everyone in your family should know how to text because that may be the only way to contact one another it s also a good idea to have an emergency contact for the family that should be someone who lives out of town it may be easier to get through to someone who isn t in the immediate area during a disaster memorize the number or have it stored in your phone 7 x research source take the time to make contact cards for everyone in the family that includes your emergency contact s information and any other phone numbers that might be important during a tsunami you and your family members should carry the cards with them at all times don t forget to include the numbers for the police fire department hospitals and other emergency services on your contact card know the signs while you ll probably notified of a possible tsunami on the tv radio or internet it still helps to know the signs yourself when a tsunami occurs you ll notice severe ground shaking due to the underwater earthquakes that cause the waves ocean water may move away from the coast so shells sand and sea life are suddenly exposed you may also hear a loud roaring sound that s similar to a plane engine as a tsunami approaches 8 x research source if you observe any of these signs you should evacuate as soon as possible even if no official orders have been given your area may also have a siren or other type of audible warning that occurs when a tsunami warning is issued make sure you familiarize yourself with the warnings so you know if there s danger pay attention to official evacuation orders when there is a good chance that your area will be affected by a tsunami your local authorities will likely issue a warning to alert residents they ll also tell you if you have to evacuate based on where your home or school is located it s important to follow those instructions carefully and as quickly as possible because you ve practiced your evacuation route with your family you should know exactly where to go and how to get there 9 x research source official tsunami warnings and evacuation orders are usually shared via tv or radio news you can also find information on the internet if you re away from home at the beach or other low lying areas when a tsunami warning is issued move inland immediately if possible run uphill so you reach higher ground where the waves can t reach you don t ever stay to watch a tsunami if you re close enough to see a wave you re probably close to run away from it if you can t escape to higher ground quickly enough the best option is to climb to the roof of a tall sturdy building or a tree trees can be uprooted during a tsunami though so be sure to choose one that is large and strong 10 x research source remember your pets when you re evacuating you must make sure that you ve accounted for all of the family members who live with you including your parents siblings and grandparents however make sure that you find all of your pets as well if a situation is dangerous for you it s dangerous for your animals and they usually don t have the means to protect themselves 11 x research source to avoid losing your pets during an evacuation or tsunami situation keep animals on leashes or in carriers even if your home is in an area that s not vulnerable to the tsunami make sure to watch them so they don t wander off protect yourself from an earthquake if you live in a coastal area you may actually feel the earthquakes that cause the waves it s extremely easy to get injured in an earthquake so if you feel the ground shaking for more than 20 seconds drop to the ground and take cover under a desk or table making sure to hold on tightly 12 x research source as soon as the shaking stops round up your family and evacuate as quickly as possible the earthquake is usually a sign that a tsunami is only a few minutes away avoid hazards as you evacuate a tsunami can cause destruction to buildings power lines and other items make sure to avoid buildings from which heavy objects might fall or large trees that may be uprooted or lose branches don t go near downed power lines either because they may be live and you could electrocute yourself 13 x research source bridges can become unstable during the earthquakes that accompany tsunamis so take care if you need to cross any when you re evacuating 14 x research source check yourself for injuries before you can help anyone else after a tsunami it s important to check that you re not hurt examine yourself to see if you have any injuries that require first aid if it s a minor injury such as a small cut or scrape you can probably handle it yourself however if you have a more serious injury such as a broken bone talk to your parents so you can get medical assistance as soon as possible 15 x research source if you have an injury that is extremely painful avoid moving around too much you may wind up making it worse help your younger siblings and grandparents if you have younger brothers and sisters make sure that they are safe and uninjured after the tsunami older relatives such as grandparents may also need assistance because they may not be able to move around too well on their own if anyone needs serious medical attention bring it to your parents attention 16 x research source make sure that you know where the first aid kit is in your emergency kit so you can help with minor injuries such as putting antibacterial ointment and a bandage on a cut call for help if someone needs to be rescued it s common for people to become trapped after tsunami because the earthquake and strong waves can cause items to fall and block people in if someone in your family or a neighbor is trapped don t try to rescue them on your own instead call emergency professionals who have the right equipment to safely extract people 17 x research source people have been known to get injured or killed when they try to rescue someone on their own while you have may the best intentions in mind you may wind up putting yourself in serious danger if you try to help a friend or family member don t use the phone unless it s an emergency in the days following a tsunami phone lines are probably going to be jammed with emergency workers trying to communicate with needed resources to keep the lines open for them avoid making calls unless there is an emergency such as someone needing to be rescued or to receive medical assistance 18 x research source if you want to get in touch with family members or friends to make sure that they re safe after a tsunami text instead of calling the added benefit to texting is that it will often work even when cell phone service is out return home only when it is safe if you had to evacuate during a tsunami you ll probably want to return home as soon as it s over however you and your family should only go home if local authorities have announced that it is safe to do so tsunamis often involve a series of waves that can take place over hours so even if one passes there may be another one on the way 19 x research source in some cases the subsequent waves may be larger and more dangerous than the first so it s important to ensure that tsunami is over before you head home stay out of buildings with water even if the tsunami has passed and officials have decided that you can return home you should be careful when you go back stay out of your home or any building that still has water in it the water may cause floors to split and walls to collapse so the building may be a danger for you and your family 20 x research source if you re not sure whether a building still has water in it or not try to look through a window to see avoid going inside if you re not sure check your home for dangers you may assume that your home is safe if there is no water inside but there are other dangerous problems that may occur after a tsunami even if the water has receded the floors may be damaged so be careful where you step your parents also should check the house for gas leaks as well as other fire hazards such as frayed wires a submerged fuse box or circuit breaker and wet electrical appliances 21 x research source it s best to let your parents inspect your home before you go inside they ll be able to tell if everything is safe so you and your siblings don t injure yourselves you can usually tell if there s a gas leak if you smell gas in your home or you hear a hissing or blowing sound if you suspect there s a leak tell your parents and immediately leave the house,Home-and-Garden
how to prepare for a tsunami,tsunamis are a series of waves caused by a massive disturbance of water in general tsunamis are not particularly threatening as they constantly happen every day around the world often in the middle of the ocean in fact most tsunamis don t reach much higher than regular ocean waves on the beach but in some cases the tsunami will develop into potentially destructive waves if you live in a coastal area it s imperative that you know what to do should this situation arise,know your community s evacuation routes if you live in a coastal community you probably have an evacuation route even if you re not aware of it or if it s not often talked about in short it ll be the quickest way to reach high ground you want to be ideally 2 miles 3 2 km away from shore and at least 100 feet 30 5 m above sea level 1 x research source if you are a tourist ask your hotel or various approachable locals about policy if you re concerned familiarize yourself with the terrain so if the worst were to happen you could fend for yourself even though you ll probably be following everyone else know that they re heading for high ground too and you should do the same and those evacuation routes won t really do you much good if you don t practice them so round up the kids and the family dog and go how long does it take to reach your safety spot are there any potential issues that could crop up do you know how to reach your back up route in the event one is impassable or jammed 2 x research source make an emergency kit for your home work and vehicle you want one available for wherever you may be when the time comes worst case scenario is you get caught somewhere for a few days before evacuations start happening so you want 72 hours worth of goods 3 x research source put in things like a roll of toilet paper first aid equipment energy bars and water here s a list to get you started water a large amount to last for about a week a prepaid sim card in a phone be sure the phone has a long lasting battery canned or packaged foods a large amount to last for about a week flashlight hand cranked flashlights are a good idea radio tuned to noaa station that gives the all clear signal sanitary items such as toilet paper moist towelettes garbage bags zip ties hand sanitizer first aid equipment band aids gauze pads etc whistle map tools wrench to turn off utilities manual can opener duct tape spare clothes anything for individuals with specific needs infants elderly etc have a family communication plan if you re at work the kids are at school and your spouse is at home all the group planning in the world won t do you any good have a plan on where to meet if a tsunami were to strike when you re in different areas invest in a set of walkie talkies and outline the plan making sure all parties understand that that s where they need to meet regardless of circumstance if you have kids that are in school familiarize yourself with their policy they may take the kids to their own spot ask your student s teacher or a faculty member about their tsunami policy take a first aid course if your community gets hit people like you may need to rise to the occasion if you have taken a first aid course you can administer cpr attend to basic injuries and help save lives including your own or that of someone you love definitely read up on wikihow s first aid and emergency articles but consider taking a legit course from a nearby school hospital or community center you ll be helping better the world from day 1 learn some survival skills if you know what do when in 4 feet 1 2 m of water and a toyota corolla is coming at you you can stay calm and most importantly survive and then there s the skills that help you survive when the community is in shambles were you a girl or a boy scout by any chance once you know how to predict a tsunami and how to handle the situation when it comes your main duty is to pass your learning onto others if your community doesn t have a program start one it s imperative that everyone knows how to operate under these conditions look into flood insurance tsunami insurance just isn t really a thing but flood insurance definitely is if your house is even a half mile to a mile away from the coast inquire about it 4 x research source the last thing you want to worry about is reconstructing your life when you have so much else on your plate having insurance at least eliminates some financial stress invest in a hurricane shelter if possible the more mental anguish you can avoid the better and having a hurricane shelter can be a serious load off your emergency route would lead you there and you could stash your emergency kits in it as well home away from home if need be know that an earthquake often precedes a tsunami though not 100 of the time usually a coastal earthquake is what sets off a tsunami 5 x research source so if at any point the ground beneath you is even quivering go on high alert a tsunami could come in a matter of minutes or matter of hours or it could not come at all tsunamis also have a tendency to travel 6 x research source an earthquake can happen in alaska and a tsunami can strike in hawaii this is all quite scary so just take note that they don t happen incredibly often most waves lose energy out at sea far away from civilization look to the sea usually during a tsunami the water will recede very far back the water will be inactive and the only waves will be very small and barely make it up to the beach nearby boats and ships will be likely to bob up and down a small wave might come up and fill the water where it is supposed to be but then it will recede back in a second these are excellent signs that a tsunami is coming 7 x research source do a quick youtube search right now for videos it s quite startling if you think you won t be sure whether or not the tide has receded think again so much land that almost never breathes air will make its fateful appearance and it ll be impossible to ignore understand that if you are sure that something is going to happen you should warn other people immediately get everyone to evacuate the beach and any area near the shore yell scream and make an idiot out of yourself if you need to in order to grab their attention many people will be entranced by the odd behavior of the ocean and not realize something is wrong if you don t want to jump to conclusions look to the animals how are they acting we may be technically smarter than them but they know when nature has gone awry if they re acting funny something is definitely up 8 x research source know that a tsunami can be more than one wave and they can be separated by short or very long periods of time so if the first wave is not very aggressive or not very big don t think you can go back to the beach and that your tsunami did not live up to the hype many times people think that the tsunami is over and are injured or killed by the second or third wave 9 x research source tsunamis spread so a small wave in one area could be a behemoth of a wave in another if you hear word that another area has been hit presume yours will be too though the gravity of the wave could be very different 10 x research source if you re a native follow your evacuation plan depending on the tsunami sometimes one mile isn t enough the wave can sweep as much as 2 000 feet 609 6 m it doesn t happen often but you want to be as safe as possible and assume the worst so get far away from the water and get to high ground ideally you want high ground that s natural like a mountain or hill the 32nd floor of a high rise that gets swept away and turned to rubble by the current is not a good place to be 11 x research source if you re a tourist just go the last thing you expected on your week long relaxing visit to thailand was a tsunami but that doesn t mean it won t happen you could be casually resting on the beach eyes closed earbuds in and all of a sudden the tide starts acting as if it has a mind of its own when that happens head for the hills even if it s on foot just run follow the locals tourists are often the ones absent mindedly looking to the sea and then not running till it s too late you see the locals scatter way before the visitors if you re in the sea go further out to sea take your boat and go far from shore but you should know how to get back from there you ll waste far too much time getting to shore and docking apart from that in the middle of nowhere the waves have room to spread out and thus their ferocity gets exponentially diminished that and you don t run the risk of the side of a building or a semi truck hitting you in the face you ll be much safer at sea half the danger of a tsunami lies in the debris just like in a tornado 12 x research source grab your kit if it s nearby and seek high ground that s why you have a kit everywhere you could possibly be so whether you re high tailing on foot on a bicycle or in your car grab it and go once you re there use your radio to tune in to your weather alert station and use the walkie talkie to channel your family is everyone on their way oh and grab your pet too don t make the little guy fend for himself is there food you can spare for him in the kit if need be understand that if you are caught in the tsunami s grip don t fight the current you might drown a bunch of deadly debris might be floating by such as cars trees or rocks try to grab onto the debris or something solid in the ground like a pole if you can t grab the debris try to avoid it move out of its way swiftly or duck beneath if you grab something or float on something until the water subsides or you are able to get away from the wave you are likely to survive 13 x research source in short if you can t beat em join em and a tsunami is one move mother nature has up her sleeve that you definitely can t beat so if you do get swept up in her power roll with it grab the nearest suv that s going for a new age joy ride and hang on the worst will be over in the first few seconds,Home-and-Garden
how to survive an earthquake in your car,earthquakes are dangerous natural disasters that occur every year if you live in a region prone to earthquakes you might at some point find yourself in your car when one strikes depending on the circumstances this could present a variety of challenges to you ultimately by parking your car in a safe location reacting to the earthquake as it happens and preparing in advance with an earthquake survival kit you ll stand a better chance at surviving in your car,pull over to the shoulder if you re driving when the earthquake strikes you should pull over to the shoulder of the road in a quick and safe manner this is important as you don t want to be struck by other motorists who are trying to flee the area make sure to signal and or turn your hazard lights on if you are on an overpass wait until you are on solid ground before you stop 1 x research source look for a location where things can t fall on your vehicle as you re trying to pull over you should look around for a spot where your vehicle will be safe from falling debris if you re in the middle of a city you may not have many good options in this case you may just want to park your car in a place you are most comfortable with 2 x research source park your car away from expansion joints on an elevated highway if you find yourself driving on an elevated road during an earthquake find a safe location to park your vehicle away from the joints of the highway this is important as the concrete slabs of the highway could fall off their supports during the earthquake 3 x research source turn off your engine after you park your car you should turn the engine off immediately this is important as the earthquake could damage your vehicle or rupture the gas tank creating a situation where your car catches fire or even explodes 4 x research source put your emergency brake on once your engine is off put your emergency beak on your emergency break will help keep your car from rolling backwards or forwards if the ground becomes unlevel below the vehicle this is especially helpful if you re on a bridge or elevated road where your car could roll off 5 x research source switch on your radio once the worst of the earthquake has subsided turn your radio on and search for a news station the station will likely broadcast valuable information about the extent of the earthquake evacuation routes rescue efforts and instructions for people hurt or trapped by the event 6 x research source stay in the vehicle and assess the situation while you may be tempted to jump right out of the car after the earthquake is over unless it is an emergency you should stay a moment and look around if the earthquake was minor and you think you can safely drive away do so but be careful when assessing the situation pay attention to 7 x research source downed powerlines around you the condition of the road around you whether other people are getting out of their cars if you smell gasoline or natural gas whether your vehicle is damaged or not alert others if you need assistance if you are injured or trapped in your vehicle alert others immediately you can do this by waving to people shouting or using a noise making device from your survival kit with a little luck someone will quickly come to your aid get out of your car if you smell gasoline whether you are in the middle of an earthquake or afterwards you should exit your car immediately if you smell gasoline this is important as your car could potentially catch on fire or even explode 8 x research source leave your car if you hear a tsunami alert if you re near water and hear a tsunami alert you should leave your car and run at least 0 5 miles 0 80 km inland or at least 100 feet 30 m above sea level you ll likely be safer higher up than trying to flee in your vehicle if that is not an option then run to an evacuation tower these towers are located in low lying coastal areas where moving inland is impossible get as high as possible and be prepared to move further up the tower if the tower is at a public building note that the walls of the building are designed to break away to allow water to flow through but the tower will remain standing find a container to house your kit depending on the size of your car and what you choose to include you can pick from a number of receptacles to store your kit items the item you pick should be sturdy and big enough to hold everything you want in addition you should be able to organize your items in it some possible items include large buckets a cloth canvas grocery bag an old suitcase or a large plastic storage container depending on the size of your kit you ll probably have to store your water outside of it store water in your vehicle perhaps the most important element of your survival kit is drinking water if you find yourself trapped in your car it may be hours or even days until rescue workers reach you during that time you ll need water to survive pack as much as you can 9 x research source avoid storing water in your trunk as you may not be able to access it in some circumstances the closer and more accessible your water the better pack food into your kit include as much high calorie food in your survival kit as you can while space might be an issue chances are you can find food that takes up minimal space but has a lot of calories you may need the calories if you re stuck in your car for a prolonged period 10 x research source energy bars are a great option to include in your survival kit as they have a lot of calories and will last a long time include a foghorn or noise making device if you find yourself stuck in your car you may need to make noise to alert rescue workers in this case the louder your noise making device the better ultimately this is an essential piece of your car earthquake survival kit 11 x research source cover your ears or use ear plugs when you use your noise making device point the noise making device away from you and out a window if possible get a flash light if your vehicle is completely covered under rubble or debris it may be completely dark if this is the case you ll need a flash light to help determine your situation use other parts of your survival kit or to signal rescuers 12 x research source include extra batteries for your flash light expand your kit to include other items you think you need in addition to the basics there are many other items you might consider including in your kit these items include food communication items and first aid items view this list for more ideas on what to include,Home-and-Garden
how to protect your home during an earthquake,an earthquake occurs when there is a sudden release of energy between two plates in the earth s crust creating seismic waves an earthquake has 4 different types of boundaries so it creates different scales of damage from an earthquakes some can cause tsunami and some can cause things as simple as pans clattering to your house floor as a result of earthquakes damage to land buildings and homes can also occur although earthquakes cannot be avoided the damage they leave in their wake can be reduced drastically in order to achieve this the right precautions must be taken,evaluate elements outside the home that are potential hazards trees that are old or leaning electrical wires and power lines can be detrimental to the infrastructure of your home during earthquakes the way to counter potential damage is to reinforce structures 1 x research source for power lines and potential electric wires that might fall and cause damage reinforce foundations and ceilings with concrete and plywood sheathing respectively to brace your house for falling objects consider removing or cutting down trees that could fall onto the home reinforcing your home with concrete for its foundation and plywood sheathing for your ceiling will help protect it but so will ridding the surrounding area of things that could potentially fall and cause the damage you re bracing it for make any necessary repairs to your home look at walls your chimney foundation and roof tiles to inspect them for any potential weaknesses if you find that they have some make those repairs before disaster strikes to prepare yourself for potential earthquake damage 2 x research source use additional plywood sheathing underneath chimneys to reinforce ceilings and prevent bricks and or mortar from falling through the ceiling fix roof tiles that are loose and anchor heavy roofing material properly on a roof frame to ensure the roof is strongly braced add braces to chimneys to prevent it from falling over make sure that they are steel collar braces add support to cripple walls earthquakes can potentially shift cripple walls so bracing them is necessary to support the floor and exterior walls of the home 3 x research source add 2x4 boards between vertical studs at the top and bottom of a cripple wall to brace it securely against the foundation build better walls to make your home more earthquake resistant 4 x research source add steel frames or plywood panels to offset structural problems from quake damage secure the frame to the foundation by installing anchor bolts through the frame and into the foundation 5 x research source anchor sill plates properly to the foundation sill plates are the horizontal part of the wall that vertical architecture like walls is built on it acts as a layer between the wall and the house s foundation if they aren t bolted down an earthquake can make the sill plates shift 6 x research source bolts need to be long enough to penetrate through the plate and several inches of foundation every six feet along the exterior walls hire a professional contractor to do this work for you as it is extensive and must be done correctly install windows with round corners traditional rectangular window frames are more susceptible to having their corners cracked and chipped as a result of pressure from the earthquake shifting the frames windows can be preserved if you round out the corners instead of using the default angled corners most windows come with 7 x research source restrain large equipment furniture pieces and appliances secure wall hangings bookshelves computers and entertainment centers with flexible fasteners have your refrigerator and your hot water heated bolted down to prevent gas lines from breaking if the quake causes them to fall over 8 x research source inspect the home for any apparent structural damage if there are any structures that look unsafe evacuate the home if there is just a lot of debris and shifted furniture make sure you are wearing shoes as you look around and assess the damage the earthquake has done watch out for any downed wires do not touch wires or objects that risk potential harm clean up spills from drugs medicines and other potentially dangerous materials immediately however be careful of cleaning up chemical spillage because mixing the wrong chemicals might have adverse effects if you are unsure about whether or not it s safe to clean up open windows or a door to provide ventilation check your utilities and turn off any damaged utilities 9 x research source gas is harder to turn off take two bricks and crank the lever 90 degrees to the left that turns it off for electricity just flip the main switch on the breaker box off that turns all the electricity in your house off once you are sure there are no fires in your house turn the water off plug all water sources water pipes may become damaged and water might come out your drains and flood your house call the fire department or electric company to have your utilities turned back on once a thorough inspection has been conducted create an emergency plan an emergency plan covers what to do in the case of an earthquake and lets you be aware of which areas of your home are dangerous and which areas you should stay away from make sure that every member of your household knows the emergency plan in the case of an evacuation route 10 x research source put together an emergency supply kit keep it somewhere safe and easily accessible ideally an emergency kit should include enough essentials that could last at least 72 hours within the supply kit some of the basics include one gallon of water per person per day non perishable food items a noaa weather radio a battery powered radio a first aid kit flashlight extra batteries etc 11 x research source know how to shut off your home s utilities in case of an emergency knowing where to go to cut off the water main gas and electric is important especially if a leak occurs due to damage from an earthquake every household member needs to know how to turn off the utilities to protect the home and the people in it 12 x research source review your homeowner s insurance policy periodically you want to be sure that in the case of an earthquake disaster striking you have the exact coverage you need to rebuild and or add repairs to your home if damage incurs 13 x research source if you live an area that is prone to earthquakes consider purchasing earthquake insurance,Home-and-Garden
how to deal with being indoors during an earthquake,if you found yourself indoors during an earthquake would you know what to do many modern buildings are designed to withstand moderate earthquakes and are relatively safe however you are still in danger from falling objects and other debris,stay inside it can be tempting to run outside when an earthquake happens after all nothing can fall on you there however you likely won t make it outside before things start falling so it s better to find a safe place inside than to try to make it outside turn off the stove and take other safety precautions turn off the stove quickly before taking cover if there are candles lit blow these out as well 1 x research source it is important to take safety precautions before the quake gets worse hit the floor the safest place for you in an earthquake is on your floor however don t lie flat on the floor instead get on your hands and knees 2 x research source this crawling position is the best for two reasons one it gives you a chance to move if you need to two it provides you with some protection from falling objects find a safe place the best place for you in an earthquake is under a table a table provides protection from falling objects a desk is also a good option try to move away from the kitchen also try to get away from your fireplace large appliances glass and heavy furniture as any of it can injure you if you can t get under a table move to an interior wall and cover your head in a large building move away from windows and exterior walls if possible also don t get on the elevator most modern buildings are built to withstand earthquakes as they are built to flex in older buildings you may be slightly safer on a higher floor but you shouldn t try to move floors during an earthquake 3 x research source a doorway isn t the safest place in modern houses as it isn t any stronger than any other part of the house in addition you can still be hit by falling or flying objects in a doorway 4 x research source hold your position once you ve found a good position stay where you are don t move from that position until the earthquake is over remember many earthquakes have aftershocks too 5 x research source make sure to grab onto whatever you re hiding under it should help provide you with some stability if the furniture you are under shifts stay with it the earthquake may move it around stay in bed if you re already in bed don t try to get up you are safer there than if you tried to move somewhere else especially if you are groggy you could easily be cut by broken glass if you try to roll out of bed 6 x research source grab a pillow and put it over your head this step can provide some protection from falling objects you can also try to cover up with a blanket which can protect you from glass protect your head and face whether you are under a piece of furniture or not try to use something to shield your head and face for instance a pillow or couch cushion can provide some protection however don t waste time trying to find something if the earthquake is intensifying also don t leave your shelter to find a face shield 7 x research source try to stay calm remember that the calmer you are the more rational decisions you will make when you are flustered or panicked you will not be able to make the best decisions for your safety and the safety of others sometimes remembering that your calm is critical is the key to staying calm you can also try to take deep calming breaths for instance try counting to four as you breathe in then try counting to four as you breathe out deep breathing can help relax you even when the earth is literally shaking around you don t create fire while it s tempting to light a fire or candle when the electricity is out doing so can be dangerous after an earthquake if your gas line has a leak anywhere you could cause your house to go up in flames with a spark instead reach for a flashlight 8 x research source check for injuries look at yourself and the people around you checking for major injuries major injuries include head injuries broken bones or major cuts 9 x research source if injuries need immediate attention deal with them first if they can wait a minute you may want to check the house first since a gas leak or electrical damage may pose a threat of more harm provide first aid as needed for instance bandage any wounds according to the first aid booklet you have if you have injuries you can t deal with you may need to call 911 keep in mind though that emergency services will be overloaded so try to take care of what you can look for structural issues if parts of the house look damaged don t hesitate you may notice walls or floors crumbling for instance or cracks forming if you re not sure whether an area is safe get out of the house you don t want to stay in a structure that is unsafe and may come down around you 10 x research source check the house s infrastructure walk around the house looking for issues the main things you need to look for right now are gas leaks water leaks and electrical problems 11 x research source make sure you are smelling as you move around the house smell is the main way you can tell if there is a gas leak though you may hear hissing as well if you smell or hear gas shut off the main gas valve you should already know how to do this step if you prepared for the earthquake in method one also open windows and get out of the house call your gas company to tell them about the leak look for electrical problems if you see any damaged wires or sparks turn off the electricity if you see water leaks turn off the main water supply if you re short on water consider alternative sources such as melted ice cubes the water from your hot water heater and water from canned vegetables and fruits check with authorities about water and sewage this information will likely be on the radio or television you need to check if the city s water supply is still safe to drink in addition you need to make sure the sewer lines are still intact before you flush a toilet 12 x research source clean up harmful substances if anything is spilled in the house that could be hazardous you need to clean it up quickly cleaning supplies for instance can become hazardous especially if they re mixed also clean up any drugs or medicines 13 x research source try to wear gloves when cleaning to protect your skin open windows to provide ventilation as needed stay off the roads the roads need to be open for emergency vehicles to get through try to stay off the roads as much as possible as that will allow easy passage for emergency vehicles 14 x research source stock up on supplies if you live in an earthquake prone area such as california make sure you are prepared should an earthquake strike having supplies is one way to be prepared so you ll have exactly what you need on hand should disaster strike 15 x research source you ll want to have a fire extinguisher a battery powered radio a flashlight and extra batteries it is also good to have plenty of non perishable food and bottled water in case power is out for a while at a minimum you should have enough food and water for 3 days on hand the cdc recommends keeping 1 gallon of water per person per day don t forget to think about your pets as they will consume food and water too also check the food and water you store for emergencies at least once a year to use up or throw away food and water that is near or past its expiration date 16 x research source buy or build a first aid kit in an earthquake injuries can happen having a first aid kit on hand can help you deal with minor injuries especially since emergency rooms will likely be overloaded you can buy a kit ready made or you can gather supplies to make your own 17 x research source the american red cross recommends that you have the following items in your first aid kit adhesive bandages 25 in various sizes adhesive cloth tape absorbent compress dressings 2 5 by 9 inch dressings 2 roller bandages 1 each 3 inch and 4 inch sterile gauze pads 5 3 by 3 inch pads and 5 4 by 4 inch pads and 2 triangular bandages you ll also need things like antibiotic ointment antiseptic aspirin cold compresses a breathing barrier for cpr hydrocortisone non latex gloves in case of latex injuries an oral thermometer tweezers a first aid booklet available from places like the red cross store and an emergency space blanket learn first aid and cpr if you a family member or friend are injured during an earthquake and can t get help you will be grateful that you know how to take care of basic injuries first aid and cpr classes teach you what to do in an emergency if someone is injured 18 x research source learning first aid can teach you how to deal with injuries such as cuts bruises head injuries and even broken bones cpr helps you learn what to do when someone is choking or not breathing 19 x research source check with your local american red cross to find first aid classes in your area learn how to turn off the gas water and electricity though these are common comforts of daily life during a natural disaster they can be life threatening gas can leak electricity can spark and water can become contaminated after an earthquake you may need to turn one or all of these off 20 x research source to turn off the gas turn the valve a quarter turn using a wrench the valve should now be perpendicular with the pipe if it s parallel it means the gas line is open 21 x research source note that some experts recommend keeping the gas line on unless you smell a leak hear hissing or notice the gas meter is running up quickly because once you turn it off you will need to bring in a professional to make sure it is safe to turn it back on 22 x research source to turn off the electricity find the circuit box turn off all the individual circuits and then turn off the main circuit the power should remain off until a professional confirms that there are no gas leaks 23 x research source to turn off the water find the main valve turn the handle clockwise until it is completely closed you should leave the water off until you know it is safe to turn it back on your city should update you on whether the water is safe to drink or not secure your water heater in an earthquake your water heater can tip or be damaged causing a huge pool of water if you can protect that water and keep it from leaking out of the water heater in the first place you can use it as a source of clean drinking water even if the city water isn t safe therefore it s important to secure your hot water heater before an earthquake hits 24 x research source www seattle gov documents departments emergency preparedness hazardspecific earthquake reducinghazards earthquakesafety_securingwaterheater pdf start by checking how much room is between the water heater and the wall if you see more than an inch or two you need to add a strip of wood to the wall using lag screws the strip of wood should go down the length of the water heater so it can t tip backwards use heavy gauge metal strapping to secure the water heater to the wall at the top start at the wall wrap it around the front and then all the way around the heater again push it back to the wall you now have an end on either side to secure to the wall or the wood at the back for wood use lag screws with oversized washers the screws should be at least 1 4 by 3 for concrete you need 1 4 expansion bolts instead of screws you can also by a commercial securing kit that has everything you need add another round of strapping to the bottom and secure it it s also important to take out the rigid copper and metal pipping instead use flexible connectors for both the gas and water which are less likely to break in an earthquake decide where to meet after an earthquake when earthquakes happen phones can go down you may not be able to reach your loved ones therefore it s important to decide beforehand where you will meet if one happens you could say for instance that everyone comes home once the earthquake has passed or that you meet at a nearby safe spot such as a church also consider designating a person who s not in the same area as the contact person for instance you could designate one of your parents as the contact so that other out of state people have someone to call to hear news that way you can deal with the emergency while your family can still hear news about you earthquake proof your home if you live in an earthquake prone area consider moving heavy objects from high shelves and anchoring heaving furniture to the floor during a quake these objects can fall or move injuring you or others in your home 25 x research source books vases rocks and other decorative items can fall off high shelves crashing into people below move them so they are below head level below waist level is best where they can do less damage try to attach heavy furniture cupboards and appliances to the walls or floor attaching objects to the walls or floors keeps them from moving or falling over in an earthquake you can use nylon stripping or l brackets to anchor furniture like china hutches or bookcases to the studs in the wall though stripping will cause less damage to the furniture 26 x research source you can also use nylon straps or velcro to secure items like televisions to their furniture 27 x research source,Home-and-Garden
how to act after an earthquake,the aftermath of an earthquake can be devastating but it s important that you are alert and focused after an earthquake strikes fires gas leaks and injury are all dangers you face after an earthquake and the more prepared you are to respond the safer you ll be by bracing for aftershocks assessing the safety of your location and following the directions of local authorities your chances of surviving the aftermath of an earthquake will be much higher,check yourself for injuries make sure you re not seriously hurt before you do anything if you re bleeding elevate your injury and put pressure on it if your injury is serious call for help using a cell phone or try to get rescuers attention 1 x research source signal for help if you re trapped use a cell phone to call for help if you have one if you can t use a phone try knocking loudly on something nearby until rescuers find you 2 x research source help others around you look to see if there s anyone trapped nearby or if someone needs medical attention if there s a first aid kit near you grab it and use it on minor injuries if someone is bleeding apply pressure to the wound and wrap the injury in gauze if you have some if someone has no pulse administer cpr if you encounter someone with substantial medical injuries seek professional medical assistance prepare for aftershocks aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock of an earthquake and they can cause significant damage expect aftershocks to occur and prepare to move to a safe location like an open outdoor space or a structurally sound building 3 x research source if an aftershock does occur drop to the ground cover yourself and hold on to something until the shaking stops put on sturdy shoes and clothes try to find a long sleeve shirt and pants so your body is protected from glass and debris if you have access to a hard hat goggles or a mask put those on too if you don t have access to shoes or clothes walk around debris and fallen objects to avoid hurting yourself 4 x research source exit the building once the shaking has stopped and you know it s safe the structure of the building you re in may have been weakened by the initial earthquake so you should exit in case of any aftershocks that could cause more damage to the building 5 x research source if you re in a high rise building after an earthquake hits do not use the elevators to exit slowly descend the stairs of the building and exit outside 6 x research source if you re in a stadium or theater exit the building calmly watching out for any debris that could fall on you 7 x research source stay put if you re outdoors following an earthquake do not enter any buildings unless they have been deemed safe by authorities buildings that look safe could be at risk of collapse if an aftershock occurs or falling debris inside could seriously injure you 8 x research source get to a wide open space once you re outside avoid standing near buildings or other large objects that could fall on you if an aftershock hits if you re near a coast head for high ground in case a tsunami forms after the earthquake 9 x research source call your family neighbors or a roommate if you have a cell phone find out if they re alright and what the status of your home is if you re not there make a plan and establish a place to meet find a local shelter if your home is unsafe to return to if you re not sure where the nearest shelter is ask an emergency official nearby or see if a neighbor knows do not re enter your home until you are certain that it is safe 10 x research source drive carefully traffic lights may not be working and there could be fallen debris on the road clear the way for any emergency response vehicles you encounter 11 x

how to prepare your family for an earthquake,the earth s tectonic plates are in constant movement when that movement is blocked energy accumulates until it is finally enough to break the plates free and allow them to continue moving this sudden release of seismic energy is an earthquake earthquakes can destroy buildings and disrupt normal operations for days and weeks at a time you might have to deal with power failures contaminated drinking water and food shortages,make an earthquake emergency plan for all members of your family this includes picking a safe place to take refuge at home school and work keep in mind that during an earthquake you ll have only seconds to get into a safe place such as underneath sturdy furniture or against an interior wall away from windows and unsecured furniture that could fall on you knowing what to do if you re not all together including having communication methods and central meeting points identify a single meeting place for all family members to reunite when possible after an earthquake mapping escape routes to and from your home this means making escape route plans for leaving work school other regularly visited places to your home and plans for leaving your home be aware of alternative routes and be aware that if the electricity and internet connections are down you need paper maps and road guides keep the escape plans in your go bag or in a safe place at work school etc deciding who can help you if you need to leave the city or town for a while which family members or friends interstate or across the region might put you and your family up for a while if things are bad enough that you have to leave ask them in advance if they are prepared to be your refuge in such a situation and reassure them that you will cover costs etc make sure every family member has the name and phone number or e mail address of an out of area contact memorized you can all use this contact to check in and make it known that you re safe even if local lines of communication aren t working let all family members know that telephone lines tend to be overwhelmed after a natural disaster as everyone tries to contact their loved ones prefer texting over calling as it uses a lot less power and is more likely to get through to people let family members know that there may be a substantial amount of time when communications are impossible and that it is important to follow the plans and neither panic nor assume the worst if your family knows the plan well there is less need for worry make a list of all the emergency supply items you need for one week of sitting it out should utilities go down and roads become unusable once the list is made shop for the supplies and set them aside in storage areas of your home you will also need a go bag in case your house becomes uninhabitable as a result of the quake a suggested list is provided below rehearse the actions to take when a quake hits every family member old enough to follow instructions should know what to do when a quake happens the more you rehearse the actions the more natural the self protection reaction will be when the quake occurs and everyone will be less likely to panic practice the drop cover hold drill in each selected safe place hunker down beneath the sturdy furniture or against the interior wall cover your neck and head and hold on make it a habit to hold quake drills once a month if you live in a quake prone area make it fun such as combining quake drill night with takeout food or a movie together afterward by making it a family affair and associating the rehearsal with positive things being quake safe becomes a fact of your everyday life not something to be afraid of prepared people stay alive know some of the basics of staying safe during an earthquake make sure that every family member is aware of the following if you re outside get away from power lines buildings street lights and anything else that might fall on you be aware that glass windows shatter and can rain shards down onto the street so buildings with large glass expanses are not safe to be under during a quake if you re inside do not try to run outside if you do you risk being hit by falling debris from awnings glass shards bricks scaffolding cement decorations forced off buildings etc practice using battery operated equipment show family members how to use radios cooking equipment flashlights etc that are powered by electricity or other contained energy sources have a few practice runs you could even have an entire night of camping in your home to see how it goes never cook indoors with fuel stoves or barbecues carbon monoxide is one of the by products of burning fuels it is odorless and colorless and it kills quickly always keep cooking gear outdoors and make sure every family member is aware of this need tell children that if they cannot operate the cooking gear safely should you not be there to help them during any emergency that they should eat only cold food from cans dried packages and within 12 hours things from the refrigerator make your home as earthquake safe as possible make the following modifications recommended by the american red cross and federal emergency management agency fema bolt or brace water heaters gas appliances bookcases china cabinets and other tall furniture to wall studs so they re less likely to fall over hang pictures and other objects away from the bed where they re less likely to fall on you during a night time earthquake anchor or brace overhead fixtures such as lights and ceiling fans store heavy breakable items on low shelves or in cabinets that lock shut so there s less chance of them falling on you learn how to turn off your home s gas and water valves quickly in an emergency if your kids are old enough teach them how to do this as well every person old enough in the family should be able to do this make sure that all family members are aware that they are not to turn utilities back on until given the all clear by the utility or emergency authorities that it is safe to do so hire a professional to verify whether your home is secured to its foundation if it s not secured your home is at additional risk during an earthquake assemble an earthquake preparedness kit it should include basics such as a gallon of water per person per day the united states geological survey recommends storing enough water for 2 weeks a water filter or purification tablets for purifying water a camp stove for cooking without electrical or gas power one week s worth of shelf stable food for all family members including pets remember to address any special dietary needs such as diabetes or food allergies the best food sorts are canned dried pasta cookies beans etc and dehydrated

how to stay safe during a tsunami,tsunamis are dangerous natural disasters that usually occur after some sort of major geological event in or around a major body of water the true danger of tsunamis is that they can move quickly and overwhelm populated areas without much notice thankfully there are a variety of things you can do to stay safe during a tsunami by preparing staying aware and moving to a safe location during the event you ll be much more likely to survive a tsunami,look for signs of a tsunami if you re near the water you should always be aware of signs of a potential tsunami if you don t know the signs and watch for them you could potentially be taken by surprise by a tsunami warning signs include quickly rising or decreasing waters along the coast an earthquake animals such as birds fleeing in the opposite direction of the water 1 x research source listen for official communications from authorities in your area perhaps the most effective way of staying aware of a possible tsunami is to be tuned in to local warning systems you can do this by signing up for text messages being tied into an automated phone warning system or listening to loudspeaker announcements in public areas the authorities will issue a tsunami watch when a tsunami may exist and could be moving toward your location the authorities will issue a tsunami warning when a tsunami has been verified by monitoring stations 2 x research source monitor communications during a tsunami while listening for initial warnings or watches is important it is very crucial that you continue to listen for updates during the event this is because the authorities may be able to direct you to a safer evacuation route keep your cellphone by you during the event turn your radio on low during the event 3 x research source look for cover if you feel an earthquake since earthquakes are one of the most obvious signs of tsunamis you need to make sure you are safe during that event if you feel an earthquake take cover under a doorway table or somewhere similar remember to drop to the floor and take cover 4 x research source gather your family after you suspect a tsunami is on its way you should take a minute or two to organize your family make sure you know the location of young children your significant other and elderly relatives if they are with you explain to everyone that they should follow you closely if you can do so safely you should also gather pets and bring them with you when you evacuate 5 x research source move to higher ground once you become aware of an impending tsunami you need to immediately move away from the shore and toward higher ground the pace at which you move to higher ground may have a substantial impact on whether you survive the tsunami try to move at least 2 miles 3 2 km from the coast or 100 feet 30 m above sea level ultimately though the higher and farther inland you go the safer you will be while trees or tall buildings aren t a recommended way to survive a tsunami if you have no other option you should move as high up as you possibly can 6 x research source follow your evacuation route while your immediate goal is to move to higher ground you should try to stick to a pre planned evacuation route if possible this is important as following an evacuation route will limit the chance of you inadvertently putting yourself into danger wait for authorities to signal an all clear before returning to affected areas one of the biggest dangers of a tsunami event is the chance of continued tsunamis or large waves because of this wait until you get official word from local authorities before you return to low lying areas 7 x research source put together a tsunami preparedness kit your kit should include food and water for a couple days a radio batteries first aid supplies and a flashlight your kit will not only provide you with items you may need during and after a tsunami event but it will give you piece of mind while you are evacuating 8 x research source plan evacuation routes perhaps the most important part of preparing for a tsunami is creating evacuation routes to high points inland by plotting several different evacuation routes you ll limit the amount of time you may have to waste figuring out where to go during a tsunami create plans that will take you from work to a safe zone home to a safe zone likely places you may be in your community to a safe zone 9 x research source familiarize yourself with the area around your evacuation route take the time to drive or walk the route several times in advance look for alternative ways to cross rivers streets or get around major buildings by familiarizing yourself with your evacuation route you ll be much more likely to be able to avoid dangers like downed power lines or damaged bridges 10 x research source create a contact plan with your friends and family a contact plan will let you know how and when to communicate with friends or family after you have evacuated you should also include a place to meet friends and family after authorities have signaled an all clear 11 x research source choose a location that is easily accessible and in a safety zone possible locations include a friend s house a public park or a landmark make sure you include a timeline for communication in your plan for example have a first contact time maybe 1 to 3 hours after the event a second contact point 6 to 12 hours after and a third contact point a day after the event,Home-and-Garden

warnings in order for you to take preventative action by keeping these things in mind you will be able to prepare yourself seconds in advance for tremors 1 x research source 2 x research source 3 x research source,understand that earthquakes create two kinds of waves fast moving p waves and slow moving s waves p waves cause little to no shaking and rarely cause earthquake damage s waves cause strong shaking and are responsible for most injuries and deaths 4 x trustworthy source u s geological survey u s government agency responsible for conducting scientific research on the nation s land natural resources and natural disasters go to source know that the eew system in your area uses this speed difference to estimate the magnitude seismic intensity and arrival time of tremors when p waves occur a network of seismometers estimate the epicenter and the current location of waves note technical limitations 5 x research source besides the systems being only available in some countries the information provided in an eew is preliminary data from an earthquake in some cases the information can be inaccurate for example in 2018 japan s eew system miscalculated the intensity of two separate tremors 6 x research source most systems are in beta and only transmit to commercial users some systems are developed by for profit companies and you may have to pay a subscription fee such as shake alarm other systems are government funded but have partners that develop their own equipment for example weather news japan has a program called the last 10 second that requires a jp 300 subscription to use 7 x research source the window of time between an eew and the feeling of a tremor is a few seconds to a few tens of seconds for example in the east japan quake people had 15 20 seconds of warning if in the tohoku region 8 x research source you may not receive an eew before feeling the temblor conversely you may receive an eew and not feel shaking eew systems do not relay earthquake predictions or forecasts rather they share information about an earthquake in progress 9 x research source know what an eew looks or sounds like depending on the country you are in the

broadcast on radio television or sirens though research into how they can be transmitted is still being conducted in sichuan china you will hear an announcement of the earthquake and a countdown in chinese when the earthquake is expected to hit a siren sounds to warn of the tremors you will also see the alerts on tv know that eew systems stop elevators this is important as electricity could be cut to the lift trapping occupants worse the cables could break causing the elevator to fall when an eew is issued a seismic light illuminates inside the elevator to alert occupants that the elevator is being stopped due to an earthquake and that they should prepare for tremors after the doors open note that transit systems such as bart 13 x research source and the japan railway 14 x research source use eew systems to stop trains in the event of an earthquake trains automatically slow down and stop to protect against high speed derailments understand that eew systems are used to protect people as well if an eew is issued the general public is notified through the emergency alert system in the united states j alert in japan the seismic alert system mexico and similar systems they are

crawl underneath a piece of sturdy furniture such as a table or desk make sure to protect your head hold your position until shaking stops and prepare to move with the furniture lock cover and hold on if you cannot get to the ground for example if you were in a wheelchair lock your wheelchair by applying its brake bend over as far as possible and use a sturdy household object such as book to protect your head hold your position until shaking stops turn off cooking appliances if it is safe to do so before taking cover these appliances can potentially start a fire if left unattended make sure all controls on stoves ovens and microwaves are set to off before seeking cover open exit doors if you can before tremors start this will prevent them from jamming leaving you with a possible evacuation route follow instructions of emergency personnel if in a public building they may provide you additional things that you need to do to protect your lives for example they may inform you to turn off dangerous machinery or to move away from shelves or displays evacuate if you detect obvious hazards if you observe smoke fire or gas leave the building and call emergency services also evacuate on foot to higher ground if you are within a tsunami hazard zone do not wait for a tsunami warning turn on the hazard lights this will alert other drivers of the impending earthquake other drivers may be unaware of what is happening whether you receive an eew or feel shaking you should know how to prepare carefully slow down your vehicle avoid sudden braking or swerving as it could potentially cause an accident pull over to the shoulder of the road if possible stop your vehicle away from hazards such as bridges tunnels and overpasses park your car set the parking brake firmly that way your vehicle will shift less and not collide with other hazards do not leave your vehicle stay in your car until shaking stops that way you are protected from most hazards such as falling street signs lights or power lines call emergency services if you cannot safely drive or leave your vehicle after tremors stop you should not leave your vehicle if a power line has fallen on your car or if there are other hazards that may stop you from exiting your vehicle safely continue driving carefully drive slowly and prepare for cracks in roads landslides liquefaction or fallen debris evacuate if you detect obvious hazards if your vehicle catches fire exit and call emergency services also evacuate on foot to higher ground if you are within a tsunami hazard zone do not wait for a tsunami warning carefully move away from structures street lights buildings towers and power lines are a few hazards you should stay away from in the event you receive an eew or feel shaking one major hazard is a brick façade as that could potentially break apart and fall drop cover and hold on first get down to the ground then protect your head with a sturdy object such as a book finally hold your position until shaking stops lock cover and hold on if you cannot get to the ground for example if you were in a wheelchair lock your wheelchair by applying its brake bend over as far as possible and

how to extinguish a fire at the initial stages,when a fire first ignites it may be small enough that you can extinguish it with a fire blanket or a fire extinguisher on hand by being prepared and quickly determining the type of fire with which you re dealing you have an even better chance of not only extinguishing the fire but also of doing it without risking injury however remember that the safety of everyone in the proximity including you comes first if the fire is quickly spreading producing dangerous amounts of smoke or taking longer than five seconds to defeat with a fire extinguisher then you must pull a fire alarm evacuate the building and call 911,stop the fire before it starts the majority of electrical fires stem from faulty electrical wiring or poor maintenance of electrical systems to stop an electrical fire before it starts do not overload electrical outlets and ensure that all electrical work is performed to code by a licensed electrician 1 x research source also keep electrical systems clear of dust trash and spider webs which can all lead to fires 2 x research source you should also use circuit breakers and fuses as often as possible which are easy steps to take in order to stop a power surge from starting a fire 3 x research source turn off power to the electrical system if an electrical system begins sparking or a fire ignites at a wire appliance or outlet then cutting the power to the system is the first best step to take 4 x research source if the source is only sparking or the flame has not yet spread at all this step alone may be enough to extinguish the flame you should cut the power at the breaker box rather than turning off the wall switch connected to the outlet 5 x research source if the problem stems from wiring or an appliance do not simply pull the plug on the device the electrical problem occurring could very well be creating an electrocution hazard as well use a class c rated extinguisher if you cannot cut the power to the source the acceptable type of fire extinguisher in this situation depends entirely upon if you are able to cut the power to the source or not if you don t know where the breaker is the box is locked or it would simply take way too long to access then you must use a class c rated fire extinguisher 6 x research source class c extinguishers are either carbon dioxide co2 or dry chemical extinguishers and they will specifically include class c on the label on the canister 7 x research source to use the extinguisher pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle point the horn at the base of the fire and hold down the handle 8 x research source as you see the flames shrinking approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished 9 x research source if you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher then it s too large 10 x research source evacuate to a safe place and call 911 since the faulty wiring is still receiving power in this case the fire can reignite you should still cut power to the source as soon as possible you must use a class c extinguisher because they contain non conductive substances a class a extinguisher will only contain highly pressurized water which conducts electricity and can create electrocution risks 11 x research source another way to identify co2 and dry chemical extinguishers is by their red coloring water extinguishers are silver co2 extinguishers also have a hard horn at the tip instead of just a hose and they lack a pressure gauge 12 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source use a class a or dry chemical extinguisher if you have cut the power if you are able to cut the power to the source completely then you have turned the class c electrical fire into a standard class a fire 13 x research source in this case you can use a water based class a extinguisher in addition to the previously mentioned extinguishers class a extinguishers and multipurpose dry chemical extinguishers are actually recommended in this scenario because co2 extinguishers run a higher risk of the fire smoldering and reigniting once the co2 dissipates 14 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible

occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source use a fire blanket to smother the fire alternatively you can use a fire blanket to smother the fire but this step is only applicable if you were able to turn off the power to the source completely though wool most fire blankets are chemically treated wool is a good insulator of electricity you still don t want to get close enough to the source and risk electrocution if the power remains on to use a fire blanket remove from its packing grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it and drape the blanket over the small fire do not throw the blanket at the fire not only is this very effective in the early stages but does not damage surrounding area or objects use water to extinguish the fire if you don t have any type of fire extinguisher or fire blanket around then you can use water however only use water if you have 100 turned the power to the source off otherwise you not only risk electrocution but also spreading around the electricity which can spread the fire much more quickly throw the water at the base or seat of the fire water at the speed you can draw it from a sink will only be effective if the fire is very small and contained otherwise it will spread faster than you can douse it call 911 even if the fire is out you should still call 911 16 x research source smoldering objects can reignite and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely shut off the fuel supply in applicable situations the first thing you should do for fires involving flammable liquids is to turn the fuel supply off for instance if a static discharge ignites gasoline around a fuel pump the first thing you should do is hit the emergency shutoff valve located nearby at all pumping stations this act severs the small fire from the very large fuel sources around it in many instances where the flammable liquid is the only fuel source the fire may extinguish itself as soon as you cut the fuel supply use a fire blanket to smother the fire you can also use a fire blanket on small class b fires if a fire blanket is readily available this can be the easiest least damaging method to extinguish it to use a fire blanket remove from its packing grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it and drape the blanket over the small fire do not throw the blanket at the fire ensure the fire is not too large for the blanket to smother it vegetable oil igniting in a frying pan for instance is a small enough fire for a fire blanket use a class b fire extinguisher as with electrical fires water based class a fire extinguishers should not be used on liquid or oil fires carbon dioxide co2 and dry chemical fire extinguishers will have a class b rating 17 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source check the label on the extinguisher and ensure that it says class b before using it on a flammable liquid fire to use the extinguisher pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle point the horn at the base of the fire and hold down the handle 18 x research source as you see the flames shrinking approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished 19 x research source if you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher then it s too large 20 x research source evacuate to a safe place and call 911 the only exception to this rule when the liquid fire stems from vegetable oil or animal fats in commercial size deep fryers and other restaurant equipment the large size and extreme heat and fuel source of these devices get their own classification for fire extinguishers class k extinguishers restaurants with this type of equipment are legally required to keep a class k extinguisher present do not throw water on liquid or oil fires water does not mix with the oil when they are together the oil stays on top of the water the water will then boil and become steam very quickly this quick boil is dangerous since the water is on the bottom of the oil it sprays hot burning oil in every direction as it boils off and evaporates this then spreads the fire very quickly call 911 even if the fire is out you should still call 911 21 x research source smoldering objects can reignite and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely use a fire blanket to extinguish the fire if the fuel source for the fire is a solid combustible material wood cloth paper rubber plastic etc then you have a class a fire a fire blanket is a quick easy way to extinguish the initial stage of a class a fire the fire blanket removes oxygen from the fire which starves the fire of it s ability to burn to use a fire blanket remove

how to help fire victims,fires can destroy lives and livelihoods in the blink of an eye regardless of whether they stay confined to one house or spread throughout a wide area when the fire victims are people you know offers of personal help can mean a lot if you want to help fire victims you don t know you can usually donate money food or supplies through third party organizations to help in the aftermath of the 2018 california fires see our wikihow articles on helping camp fire and woolsley fire victims,get in touch 1 x research source if the fire victim is someone you know and care about get in touch with them as soon as you can simply reaching out in love to a fire victim can provide a healing dose of emotional support by its very nature house fires and similar crises can make people feel isolated and alone making contact lets your loved ones know that they are not as alone as they might feel you can call text or e mail the victim any method of communication is better than none at all keep your words simple saying i m sorry for your loss and i m glad you re alive is usually enough platitudes regarding the bright side of things don t often help especially not during the initial stages of shock if you offer your support make sure that you plan to follow through and provide it now is not the time for false promises listen more than you speak everyone reacts to tragedy in a different manner so you should wait to hear from the victim about how hopeful or distraught he or she feels before chiming in offer financial support even if the homeowner had insurance the amount of red tape and paperwork he or she will need to sort through will delay the claim a financial gift will almost always help even if you can only afford to give a small amount if you can meet in person consider handing the victim cash or a check when you want to offer financial support but must do so via mail send a check since cash is less secure another option would be to give the victim a gift card gift certificates to a grocery store are practical and make a great choice but you can also do something a little more personalized if you know the victim relatively well for instance a gift card to a bookstore can be a good choice for a family of avid readers since it gives them a chance to restock their lost book collection bring a meal during the initial chaos and trauma simple tasks like cooking dinner can seem a lot more complicated than usual cooking a meal and bringing it to your neighbor or loved one offers both practical and emotional support if you can t cook you could bring your loved ones groceries or offer to take them out to a restaurant sending food can even be helpful if the victims are staying with someone since this gesture can relieve some of the burden from their hosts replace lost belongings find out how much was lost and donate items to help replace some of those belongings it is generally a wise idea to find out what the victim needs instead of making assumptions insurance often provides fire victims with household basics for instance even if their basic supplies won t be replaced by insurance fire victims may not need such items until after they ve found a place to stay items of sentimental value can never be replaced but there might be ways for you to help dull the loss for instance if the victim is a close relative you can provide them copies of photographs they lost in the fire kids can be especially devastated when personal possessions are lost in a fire find out if there were any lost toys or games that meant a lot and ask if you can buy a replacement run an errand if you live nearby offer to run an errand for the fire victim doing so can save them time and energy that they will undoubtedly need for something else ask the victims if there are any errands they haven t been able to do yet like shopping for certain items offer to take care of these errands for them if the errand is something that the victim must be present for like something dealing with the bank or insurance company offer to drive him or her there if transportation would otherwise be a problem stick with them through the process commit to helping your neighbor or loved ones throughout the entire recovery process when the initial flood of support passes by they will appreciate that you ve still remained by their side as the process continues the victims needs may change someone who wasn t ready to replace household goods at first might need to do so three months later for instance make it a point to keep asking the victims what they need and helping them out accordingly if nothing else continued emotional support can mean a lot to a fire victim know what to donate fire victims are usually in need of both money and supplies so donating either one can help a lot make sure that the donation you plan to make is accepted by the donation facility you plan to leave it with when donating supplies focus on things the fire victims will need immediately instead of things that will be needed later on some good options include clothes canned food bottled water pain relievers baby food trash bags laundry detergent socks pillows blankets and diapers 2 x research source identify a charity to support start with local relief efforts if you want to support people affected in your area if you re unsure of what charity to

a sinking car if you stay calm and act quickly unbuckle your seatbelt immediately after entering the water open or break a window and get yourself and any other passengers out starting with any children prepare for sinking accidents by keeping a glass breaking tool in your car and rehearsing your escape plan,brace yourself for impact if you re the driver as soon as you re aware that you re going off the road and into a body of water adopt a brace position if you re driving the car place both hands on the steering wheel in the 10 and 2 positions the impact of your car hitting the water

seconds to act before your car sinks below the water and escape becomes nearly impossible undo your seatbelt as soon as you hit the water unbuckle your seatbelt you won t be able to exit the car if you re strapped in 5 x research source this is the first step in the s w o seatbelts off window open or broken out children first protocol developed by car safety expert dr gordon giesbrecht if there are children or other passengers in the car who may need help don t worry about unbuckling them yet your first priority is to unbuckle yourself so you can open up an escape route as quickly as possible open a window as soon as you ve unstrapped yourself after unbuckling your seatbelt act quickly to open your window before the water rises above window level once there is water pressing against the window it will become nearly impossible for you to open or break it if your car has electrical windows they should continue to function for a few minutes after you enter the water 6 x research source don t try to escape through a door the pressure of the water outside the door will make it nearly impossible to open within a few seconds of impact with the water even if you do manage to open the door it will cause the car to flood with water and sink more quickly 7 x research source break a window if you can t open one if you aren t able to open the window or if it only opens halfway you ll need to break it 8 x research source if you don t have a glass breaking tool such as a center punch or a glass breaking hammer on hand remove a headrest from one of the seats and strike

the window with use your feet kick near the front of the window or along the hinges rather than in the center 10 x research source get any children out first if there are children in your car unbuckle them immediately and push them out through the open window it will be easier for you to get them out and then follow them than it would be for you to come back and rescue them after getting yourself out 11 x research source if there are multiple kids in the car start by helping the oldest one they may be able to help the younger kids get to safety escape through the opened or broken window once the window is open and you ve gotten any children out climb out as quickly as you can 12 x research source your car may already be filling with water and sinking fast at this point so be prepared to
