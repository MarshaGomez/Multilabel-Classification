how to merge two households,merging two households takes a lot of work but with careful planning you can make the job easy and even fun first do a purge and give away everything you don t really use figure out what items you really must keep and create a new fresh space with a combination of everyone s most treasured items finally merging two households can involve running things a little differently to coexist well with the people you ll be sharing a home with,discuss your expectations before you begin merging two households might seem like a relatively straightforward task a question of fitting lives and possessions together in the same space like puzzle pieces the process can actually get pretty intense since it might require giving up some treasures adapting your lifestyle to fit with someone else s is a learning process that requires a lot of compromise before you start the merge have a conversation with the person you re moving in with to go over all the big decisions and prevent things from getting too emotional or tense talk about what vision you have for the new household how will the new home look will each room have a combination of both of your possessions talk about the possessions you both cherish is there something you assume your partner will give up is there something you really don t want to give up get it all out there right away purge your closets and storage rooms whether you re moving to a brand new home or someone else is moving into yours you re probably going to need all the space you can get set aside time to pull everything out of your closets and storage areas and all those nooks and crannies where you might be stashing stuff you don t use too often figure out what you need and what you don t and make a plan to get rid of the possessions you don t need right away so you can move on to the next step make three piles keep give away and not sure you can go back to the not sure pile if you end up having more space than you thought you would take a look at your items and think about how often you use them a good rule of thumb is to get rid of anything you haven t used in over a year having a yard sale is a great way to get rid of unwanted possessions and make some money in the process make sure to list your yard sale on craigslist so people know you re having it yard sales are most popular in the spring summer and fall when the weather s nice what you don t sell you can donate remember it is much easier to get rid of things before you pack and move your merge will be easier if you make the decisions before you start squeezing in items that don t work get rid of duplicates one of the most difficult parts of merging two households is deciding which possession to keep when you and the person you re moving in with both have something depending on how much space you have you ll probably have to give away some large pieces of furniture as well as smaller items like kitchen supplies who needs two toaster ovens sit down together and make a list of all the duplicates the decide which items are in the best condition and worth keeping here are a few items that you might need to consider furniture beds dressers side tables couches kitchen tables chairs etc appliances blenders toasters washers dryers coffee makers etc kitchen supplies can openers wine openers pots pans baking supplies etc extra linens sheets towels etc list your must haves some items have strong sentimental value and no matter how little sense it makes to keep them you simply must have them around get together with your partner and make a list of your must haves if some of your must haves are large items that will require a lot of space have a conversation about where they will go and whether it really makes sense to keep them make sure your list isn t three pages longer than your partner s you each get equal say when it comes to must haves this is an exercise in compromise limit your must haves to things you do actually need then go back and see which wants will fit in the new space too account for clothes and personal items consider where you will store these since you ll have less space in your merged household you and your partner will both need a plan for where you will keep these things you may be used to free rein with closet space before the merge now you may need to rotate seasonal items and store some items that aren t used so everyone has space consider boxing up or using vacuum compaction bags to store things you don t wear often organize your files and records determine what is safe to shred if you have multiple years of financial records get rid of or store any items you don t want to become common property since you re living together you can t expect the same privacy and the ability to keep certain items secret if you ve got anything embarrassing you should think twice before taking it draw a floor plan this might seem like a bit of a hassle but it will make your life a lot easier when you start moving into the new place or when someone else is moving into yours a floor plan is a drawing or illustrations of the floor space of each room in your house as viewed from above your drawing doesn t have to be a work of art just create a to scale sketch of each room include doors windows and radiators if present so you know where furniture can be positioned measure the rooms in your new space write the measurements of the different rooms along the edges of the sketched walls this way you can figure out what will fit where 1 x research source include the windows doors cabinets the kitchen island and other features that might affect how you arrange furniture in the room take pictures as well so you ll remember the little details that could help you decide where to put things decide where the large furniture will go before you even pack it up and start moving it determine where you want each piece of furniture to be positioned that way you can put it where it s supposed to go as soon as you move it into the house rather than grouping everything in the front room and trying to figure out where it should go measure the furniture to determine where it will fit check your drawing of the floor plan and visualize how each piece of furniture will look keep swatches cut from the underneath of couches chairs and upholstered pieces it will be easier to tell if items match or not before having to move them think about furniture pieces individually instead of their current arrangement follow common decorating rules in terms to help you arrange things in a pleasing fashion for example couches should be surrounded by a little space on all sides in the bedroom your bed should be the main focus rather than shoved in a corner 2 x research source find a decorating scheme that merges your tastes whether you re moving together into a brand new space or into one of your existing homes decide on a new decorating scheme that will tie all of your possessions together into a cohesive home you might want to paint the walls install new light fixtures get new curtains and so on in order to make the space feel like it belongs to the whole family and not just one person see if it s possible for each person in the house to get some space of his or her own decide which rooms will be family rooms and aim to have them reflect the personalities of the entire household consider getting furniture recovered a good upholstery shop can not only change the fabric but they can add or remove padding to change the shape you ll have a chance to pick fabrics together and there s a better chance of finding something that ties your taste together box everything up by room now it s finally time to get ready to move by putting your possessions in boxes go through your home room by room and box things up make sure fragile items are packed with soft materials to keep them safe during transit if you re having movers help you merge your two households make sure to give them clear directions about where everything should go label the boxes by color and have the person you re moving in with do the same for example items that belong in the living room could have a purple label items for the kitchen could have a red label and so on have the boxes them delivered to the appropriate room in the new home respect each other s preferences realize that merging two households means making compromises your lifestyles are about to change but that doesn t have to be a negative thing in fact it s very exciting help each other make the transition easier by respecting each other s ideas and talking everything out if you have a conflict don t start things off on the wrong foot by being stubborn about little things that don t matter if you have three hand mixers for example have the mentality that you re willing to give yours up for the sake of the household don t fight about whether to keep heirlooms if your partner really wants to keep the table his grandfather made don t fight about it even if you think the thing is hideous if it s a family heirloom it should stay in the family be open minded about the end result the new household isn t going to be like your old one and you shouldn t expect it or want it to be you re merging your tastes with your partner s to create something new and fresh with careful planning you can create a new space that you both enjoy strive for a new and improved merged household rather than trying to replicate the old house if the person is moving into your home be willing to make big changes remember that you ll need to make mutual decisions about how to improve the space from now on get the children involved merging two households can be hard on kids if children are involved in your household merge they should be involved in the decision making merging households might make them feel nervous and it s really helpful if they feel they have a say in what their new space will be like get the kids involved in packing decorating and creating a new personal space for themselves let kids decide which toys to keep and which to give away get kids excited about the new and improved space tell them moving will be an adventure make a personalized plan that meets your needs merging households means merging lifestyles think about all the factors in both of your lives that will be affected by the merge have a plan for accommodating each other s hobbies pets and so on if you have pets where will their new hangouts be where will they sleep where will you keep their food and water dishes figure out who gets what closets and storage space before you move in so you can keep your new household organized from the get go make a plan for sharing extra spaces like a nook that can be a study craft room or reading nook depending on how you want to use it share the space and don t dictate don t make the experience regretful by being a control freak make sure everyone has their own contribution to the home one person shouldn t take over both of you should feel at home allow the person with fewer items to contribute by giving them the freedom to select decorations layout or even to decorate their own personal space for example office reading nook gym area etc,Family-Life

how to cope with a dysfunctional family,it is never easy to cope with a dysfunctional family family dysfunction can drain your emotional and physical energy family get togethers may be very difficult and managing conflict may feel impossible to cope learn to set boundaries and avoid subjects that cause disagreement limit contact with family members that cause problems and learn to put yourself first remember your emotional needs and well being should be valued when coping with a dysfunctional family know and stand up for your own rights,keep your expectations realistic dysfunctional families may be resistant to change when going into a family situation work on keeping your expectations in check if you accept that some conflict and difficulty is inevitable you may be less frustrated by disagreement 1 x research source know your most difficult family members limit the amount of time you spend with these people if your mother for instance tends to be the cause of drama keep your distance do not expect a dramatic change breaking free of a cycle of dysfunction is difficult if it does happen it will take time go into the event knowing it will likely be difficult at the same time do be open to the possibility that it might be okay don t foreshadow events by deciding that they will be terrible hope for the best prepare for the worst take someone with you to family events having a buffer can help you cope ask a friend or romantic partner to accompany you to support you emotionally during family functions 2 x research source your family may be on better behavior in the presence of an outsider is there anyone you could invite maybe a friend of yours does not have christmas plans see if they want to join your family s festivities give your buffer a fair warning however let them know your family can be difficult at times limit alcohol alcohol tends to fuel emotion if your family is difficult by nature too much alcohol could lead to an increase in conflict 3 x research source there may be problem drinkers in your family if this is the case it s a good idea to call family members and request an alcohol free get together try to provide other beverages like sparkling cider instead of alcohol some family members may be uninterested in attending an event without alcohol these people will likely not show up or leave early limiting alcohol can be a great way to keep the more difficult family members away steer the conversation away from conflict if your family fights you can take it upon yourself to limit argument it s frustrating when it s up to you to make sure people get along but sometimes it s inevitable listen to various conversations and work on changing the topic when necessary 4 x research source by now you likely know the topics that trigger drama in your family for instance maybe your uncle john is chronically unemployed due to his drinking he tends to become very sensitive when the topic is raised when you hear the problem topic arising act fast for example maybe your dad says something like john have you applied to any jobs lately it s been what 6 months jump in right away and steer the conversation out of the danger zone you can try to play a game like 20 questions or simply change the subject for example dad actually sarah just applied to a job at a bookstore she s really excited about it it can be helpful to go into the event with a list of safe topics that you think everyone will enjoy maybe jot these down in your phone in case you panic and forget have an escape route at times it s appropriate to walk away if someone is getting hostile or difficult know an excuse you can use to dodge an interaction 5 x research source think of various ways to slip out for a minute you could for example offer to help out in the kitchen or run to the store to get something if you want to leave early think of an excuse you could say you re watching a friend s pet and need to check in on it for example it can be helpful to lay the groundwork for this early say on the front end that you can only stay until whatever determined time and that way people are not offended when you leave let go of some conflicts you do not have control over other people s lives and decisions even if you want a family member to change you cannot do it for them try to avoid becoming emotionally invested in long standing conflicts over which you have little power 6 x research source for instance maybe your mother is always very critical of you and your siblings as a result none of you have much contact with her at family events she continues to be critical and push people away you may wish your mother was different you may want a better relationship with her however keep in mind it s her responsibility to change if she continues to be resistant to altering her behavior there is little you can do for her try your best to emotionally disengage also remember that family events may just not be the right time to address these conflicts know that you can revisit these issues at a later time if you feel it s important that way holidays are not ruined by fighting recognize your own emotional needs you have a right to feel respected and safe in your relationships no one should violate this right the first step to asserting yourself is identifying what you need 7 x research source everyone deserves respect and that includes you you have a right to be around people who bring you up rather than down in a dysfunctional family your thoughts may be skewed you may question whether you deserve respect remind yourself you do think about what behaviors are and are not acceptable for example maybe your father continually criticizing your career choice is not acceptable to you you re proud of what you do regardless of what your father thinks it s well within your rights to assert as much be firm about boundaries in the moment let someone know when they ve crossed a line you do not have to be aggressive or mean you can be respectful while simultaneously making it clear where the line is 8 x research source for example shopping with your mother is always a headache she s very critical of your appearance and tends to scrutinize the clothing you like however she continues to push you to go shopping with her your mother has asked you repeatedly to go shopping this weekend after the third or fourth time she asks state your boundaries clearly say something like mom i love the time we spend together but i think we stress each other out when we go shopping together if you want to get lunch or see a movie some time great but i m not interested in going shopping with you anymore after establishing your boundaries it can be helpful to change the subject this signals to the other party that the boundaries are not up for debate and also suggests that you are not angry with them ask about a mutual friend or if they ve seen any good movies recently use i statements when you assert yourself i statements are statements phrased in a way to reduce blame instead of placing an objective judgment on a situation you emphasize your personal feelings they have 3 parts they begin with i feel after which you immediately state your feelings from there you explain the behavior that led to that feeling lastly you say why you felt the way you did 9 x research source for example you re frustrated that your father has again insulted your girlfriend in front of you you may be inclined to say something like it s incredibly rude to make comments on noel s weight that s completely disrespectful to me and to her this can be rephrased using an i statement say something like i feel disrespected when you make comments on noel s weight because that s an issue she s very sensitive to and i ve explained this to you before lead by example show genuine compassion and concern for your family check in with them regularly and invest in them as people do not let their bad behavior dictate your treatment of them the 2 should exist separately from each other for instance don t respond to a rude family member by being rude in return or by just writing them off try to respond to them with compassion and understanding going tit for tat isn t going to improve the situation walk away when necessary despite your best efforts to assert your needs some people are just very difficult if your family is not responding to your attempts to assert yourself it s okay to leave some situations 10 x research source for example your father is relentless when you tell him to stop disrespecting your girlfriend instead of apologizing he responds you re being hypersensitive i just care about her health you can tell from his tone he s getting hostile it may not be worth it to push the issue at this point your father is getting angry even as you try to respectfully address the situation he s trying to force an argument at this point just walk away say something like this isn t getting us anywhere i m going to go for a walk okay then give yourself some time to cool down see a therapist it s very hard to deal with the emotional toll of a dysfunctional family alone a qualified therapist can help you deal with the damage done by familial dysfunction seek out a therapist in your area to work out your issues 11 x research source you can ask your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist you can also

people feel they must forgive or let go of bad behavior if your family has been unfair to you it s okay to feel anger it s actually healthy to allow yourself to experience anger when you ve been disrespected or mistreated 12 x research source forgiveness can be the last step in recovery however it is rarely healthy to forgive first you need to put the blame on those causing the problems do not expect yourself to fix problems via forgiveness find productive ways to vent anger talk to close friends or go to support groups you can also write a letter to difficult family members and then burn it work on expressing your emotions if you come from a dysfunctional family you may have difficulty expressing your emotions work on ways to express yourself in a healthy and productive fashion if you re seeing a therapist it may be valuable to talk this over with them 13 x research source stop to identify your emotions several times a day growing up in a dysfunctional family you may have learned to repress or ignore your emotions try to take time to notice what you are feeling also what caused the feeling what are you responding to you can try keeping a journal in which you record your daily feelings you can cope with your emotions by sharing them with others work on finding people who are supportive you should only share your emotions with people who respond with kindness and affirmation learn to trust others this can be one of the hardest parts of coping with a dysfunctional family it may be difficult to trust if you come from a difficult home life start by taking small risks and then build from there 14 x research source practice seeking out the support of healthy people get to know people who are kind and positive building a family of quality friends is extremely important in maintaining self esteem and helping someone cope with family dysfunction you may have difficulty telling others how you re feeling work on getting over this hurdle start by occasionally expressing small needs and wants to those around you you can begin expressing greater needs and wants over time take good care of yourself you may neglect your own self care if you come from a dysfunctional home if you spent a lot of time coping with conflict you may put your own health and well being aside work on practicing basic self care this alone can help you better regulate your emotions 15 x research source you need to do things for yourself make sure you eat healthy meals get exercise and take care of basic hygiene you should also treat yourself on occasion if you need to take a day off take one indulge in small pleasures like going to see a movie having coffee with a friend or ordering takeout after a long day,Family-Life

how to create a calmer household,kids running everywhere tv blaring at its loudest and the ping of video games driving you insane all those constant fights you can hear raging through the door make your head want to explode meanwhile neighbors and friends keep dropping by and your spouse is hiding in the downstairs bathroom waiting for peace to descend does this sound awfully familiar if so then it might be time to start instituting some peace throughout the household and to try to lead a slightly calmer life together,be willing to set limits and ensure that your way is followed this is the first and most important thing that you can possibly do this means limits as to the times levels of noise and activity and yes bedtimes for the parents too if the kids have to get their parents out of bed for a ride to school that will be a horrible reoccurring situation every morning that can easily be avoided by going to bed at the same time as your kids your sleep is important also but don t expect to sleep when your kids need rides to school visualize a calmer home what do you see write down the things that you visualize and turn them into goals to achieve in creating your calmer household in your subconscious mind you will unearth a true picture of the house that you d like to be in always keep this focus in your mind and work towards it gradually sit down and write a list of the things that seem to be creating the most noise and sense of rushing in your home these are the first things that you will target with your limits consider such things as when you are prepared to receive visitors limiting the noise level of the tv and limiting to computer usage and put a ban on running indoors for the little ones kids need toys and entertainment but this doesn t mean tv and video games play chess mahjong backgammon instead of video games an investment in good traditional games or board games may prove cheaper than running a tv or video games console write a task chart this task chart must apply to every single member of the household and it must contain days and deadlines the larger the job that needs tackling the longer the time frame you must give it in order to maintain a calm approach to it bit by bit will get it done rather than rushing around juggling too many things at once tidy the clutter away clutter enhances the feeling of stress rushing and inability to think straight the fewer bits and pieces in your pathway the calmer you are going to feel not to mention the less cleaning up involved if the kids must keep so many toys books and video games make a deal with them they can be kept in storage spaces but if they are found strewn across the floor more than 3 times in a row they will be donated to the nearest charity store you must mean this and you must be prepared to do it for this ultimatum to have real effect clean as you create cooking creates less mess if you can wash items as you use them in between cooking moments same for anything that gets used retrain everyone to put it back where it came from the moment it has been used buy storage bins or baskets with labels if this helps to encourage everyone to do the right thing

flavors and style on the night with the main ingredients at hand ask visitors to respect your limits inform visiting family friends kids dogs and any other guests who regularly traipse in and out of your home that closing time is whatever you set it as in addition feel free to set out of bounds hours such as family lunch times on sundays this will enable you and your family to connect together over a special meal or activity without outside interruptions this also includes taking the phone off the hook and closing e mail applications file it or lose it as soon as it arrives in the post the schoolbag or the briefcase deal with it open envelopes and toss them into the recycling immediately read the letter bill or note and file it make bill paying time once a week and sit down with the file and deal with it in a matter of fact way one by one if you get school notes decide when to sit down with your child to discuss these matters then sign them away and put back in the schoolbag and if money is asked for write the check there and then and put it into the schoolbag these actions will take several minutes but spending more time on school and child matters is more important set aside calm time at least once a week and preferably once a day set aside calm time for yourself in which you do nothing more than relax and shut out all that is around you eventually encourage other family members to join you in this select a special corner or room in the house and set it up just for this purpose with soft pillows and drapes and call it something neat like mom s relaxation corner or family downtime zone familiarize everyone in the house with this space as only ever being for relaxation by any member of the family at any time of the day or night it must be away from tvs music

rachel from the barbecue i heard about the fiasco she caused at the andersons gathering the other week and i don t want to have that kind of drama at my event what do you think 2 x research source

restricted if you have a relative who tends to curse tell inappropriate jokes or start drama in some other way decide if they might agree to modify their behavior for the event for example you might tell them hi joel i know you have a trouble reeling in that potty mouth but there will be some conservative guests in attendance who aren t comfortable with curse words can you be mindful of your language if so then i would love for you to attend 3 x research source have the conversation face to face if possible if you arrive at the conclusion that the only way forward is to uninvite the person do so with tact the most courteous method to do this would be in person ask the individual to meet with you in private you might invite them out for lunch or coffee and have a chat say uncle tom how about you and i go out for coffee on tuesday i need to talk to you about something choosing a public venue might decrease the odds of your relative becoming irate or making a scene if your

still on bad terms i think it s best if you don t attend the wedding my fiancé and i really want the event to be calm and low key and you two haven t even been able to stay in a room together without arguing lately i hope you understand 5 x research source chances are if this person has gotten into trouble for their behavior or have a history of inappropriate conduct they will probably understand your decision 6 x research source don t apologize saying i m sorry sends the message that you re wrong and makes it seem like you are taking ownership of their bad behavior if you are uninviting a relative because of their behavior don t feel bad you aren t responsible for other adults behavior but you are responsible for the satisfaction of your other guests at the event if you re worried that the person will ruin the affair don t blame yourself for uninviting them 7 x research source instead of saying i m sorry say something along the lines of i don t want to hurt your feelings this demonstrates that your choice is made with good intentions while still showing that you stand behind your decision stay calm if their reaction is negative there s a possibility that your loved one will react negatively to this situation being uninvited can be humiliating to them so try to be understanding don t take anything they say personally simply stay calm and offer your support you might say i can see that you re upset i didn t intend to hurt you but i believe this is the best choice explain that your guest list is limited in some cases a relative may have been unintentionally invited maybe you accidentally selected their name while setting up an event on facebook or maybe you talked about an event in their presence and they assumed they were invited whatever the case you might be able to make up an excuse for having to disinvite them say jessica i clicked your name by accident when setting up the page for samantha s baby shower it would have been nice for you to come but we have to keep the guest list under 15 people i m sorry that this happened apologize for someone who spoke on your behalf if an invitation was extended without your permission do apologize for the miscommunication you might say hey derrick ronnie told me that he mentioned the party to you last week he shouldn t have done that our guest list is very exclusive i m sorry for this mix up even better you might suggest that the person who made the mistake deal with the situation tell them i saw regina the other day and she s under the impression that she s invited to the party she tends to drink too much and i m worried that she will make a scene can you please uninvite her be firm with those who invite themselves some family members automatically assume they are allowed at any event hosted by their relatives maybe they never got a formal invitation but have plans to attend let them down gently for example you overhear your cousin talking about what she will wear to your bridal shower you might say oh candice i didn t realize you were planning to come the shower next weekend is going to be just for coworkers but i d love to get together with you some other time just the two of us 8 x research source anticipate having other guests boycott the event the worst outcome of uninviting one guest is to have other guests refuse to come out of solidarity depending on how important their presence is to you you may try to convince them to come however don t allow yourself to be coerced into having an annoying guest in attendance stand firm in your decision even if it means a few

how to merge two households,merging two households takes a lot of work but with careful planning you can make the job easy and even fun first do a purge and give away everything you don t really use figure out what items you really must keep and create a new fresh space with a combination of everyone s most treasured items finally merging two households can involve running things a little differently to coexist well with the people you ll be sharing a home with,discuss your expectations before you begin merging two households might seem like a relatively straightforward task a question of fitting lives and possessions together in the same space like puzzle pieces the process can actually get pretty intense since it might require giving up some treasures adapting your lifestyle to fit with someone else s is a learning process that requires a lot of compromise before you start the merge have a conversation with the person you re moving in with to go over all the big decisions and prevent things from getting too emotional or tense talk about what vision you have for the new household how will the new home look will each room have a combination of both of your possessions talk about the possessions you both cherish is there something you assume your partner will give up is there something you really don t want to give up get it all out there right away purge your closets and storage rooms whether you re moving to a brand new home or someone else is moving into yours you re probably going to need all the space you can get set aside time to pull everything out of your closets and storage areas and all those nooks and crannies where you might be stashing stuff you don t use too often figure out what you need and what you don t and make a plan to get rid of the possessions you don t need right away so you can move on to the next step make three piles keep give away and not sure you can go back to the not sure pile if you end up having more space than you thought you would take a look at your items and think about how often you use them a good rule of thumb is to get rid of anything you haven t used in over a year having a yard sale is a great way to get rid of unwanted possessions and make some money in the process make sure to list your yard sale on craigslist so people know you re having it yard sales are most popular in the spring summer and fall when the weather s nice what you don t sell you can donate remember it is much easier to get rid of things before you pack and move your merge will be easier if you make the decisions before you

with both have something depending on how much space you have you ll probably have to give away some large pieces of furniture as well as smaller items like kitchen supplies who needs two toaster ovens sit down together and make a list of all the duplicates the decide which items are in the best condition and worth keeping here are a few items that you might need to consider furniture beds dressers side tables couches kitchen tables chairs etc appliances blenders toasters washers dryers coffee makers etc kitchen supplies can openers wine openers pots pans baking supplies etc extra linens sheets towels etc list your must haves some items have strong sentimental value and no matter how little sense it makes to keep them you simply must have them around get together with your partner and make a list of your must haves if some of your must haves are large items that will require a lot of space have a conversation about where they will go and whether it really makes sense to keep them make sure your list isn t three pages longer than your partner s you each get equal say when it comes to must haves this is an exercise in compromise limit your must haves to things you do actually need then go back and see which wants will fit in the new space too account for clothes and personal items consider where you will store these since you ll have less space in your merged household you and your partner will both need a plan for where you will keep these things you may be used to free rein with closet space before the merge now you may need to rotate seasonal items and store some items that aren t used so everyone has space consider boxing up or using vacuum compaction bags to store things you don t wear often organize your files and records determine what is safe to shred if you have multiple years of financial records get rid of or store any items you don t want to become common property since you re living together you can t expect the same privacy and the ability to keep certain items secret if you ve got anything embarrassing you should think twice before taking it draw a floor plan this might seem like a bit of a hassle but it will make your life a lot easier when you start moving into the new place or when someone else is moving into yours a floor plan is a drawing or illustrations of the floor space of each room in your house as viewed from above your drawing doesn t have to be a work of art just create a to scale sketch of each room include doors windows and radiators if present so you know where furniture can be positioned measure the rooms in your new space write the measurements of the different rooms along the edges of the sketched walls this way you can figure out what will fit where 1 x research source include the windows doors cabinets the kitchen island and other features that might affect how you arrange furniture in the room take pictures as well so you ll remember the little details that could help you decide where to put things decide where the large furniture will go before you even pack it up and start moving it determine where you want each piece of furniture to be positioned that way you can put it where it s supposed to go as soon as you move it into the house rather than grouping everything in the front room and trying to figure out where it should go measure the furniture to determine where it will fit check your drawing of the floor plan and visualize how each piece of furniture will look keep swatches cut from the underneath of couches chairs and upholstered pieces it will be easier to tell if items match or not before having to move them think about furniture pieces individually instead of their current arrangement follow common decorating rules in terms to help you arrange things in a pleasing fashion for example couches should be surrounded by a little space on all sides in the bedroom your bed should be the main focus rather than shoved in a corner 2 x research source find a decorating scheme that merges your tastes whether you re moving together into a brand new space or into one of your existing homes decide on a new decorating scheme that will tie all of your possessions together into a cohesive home you might want to paint the walls install new light fixtures get new curtains and so on in order to make the space feel like it belongs to the whole family and not just one person see if it s possible for each person in the house to get some space of his or her own decide which rooms will be family rooms and aim to have them reflect the personalities of the entire household consider getting furniture recovered a good upholstery shop can not only change the fabric but they can add or remove padding to change the shape you ll have a chance to pick fabrics together and there s a better chance of finding something that ties your taste together box everything up by room now it s finally time to get ready to move by putting your possessions in boxes go through your home room by room and box things up make sure fragile items are packed with soft materials to keep them safe during transit if you re having movers help you merge your two

transition easier by respecting each other s ideas and talking everything out if you have a conflict don t start things off on the wrong foot by being stubborn about little things that don t matter if you have three hand mixers for example have the mentality that you re willing to give yours up for the sake of the household don t fight about whether to keep heirlooms if your partner really wants to keep the table his grandfather made don t fight about it even if you think the thing is hideous if it s a family heirloom it should stay in the family be open minded about the end result the new household isn t going to be like your old one and you shouldn t expect it or want it to be you re merging your tastes with your partner s to create something new and fresh with careful planning you can create a new space that you both enjoy strive for a new and improved merged household rather than trying to replicate the old house if the person is moving into your home be willing to make big changes remember that you ll need to make mutual decisions about how to improve the space from now on get the children involved merging two households can be hard on kids if children are involved in your household merge they should be involved in the decision making merging households might make them feel nervous and it s really helpful if they feel they have a say in what their new space will be like get the kids involved in packing decorating and creating a new personal space for themselves let kids decide which toys to keep and which to give away get kids excited about the new and improved space tell them moving will be an adventure make a personalized plan that meets your needs merging households means merging lifestyles think about all the factors in both of your lives that will be affected by the merge have a plan for accommodating each other s hobbies pets and so on if you have pets where will their new hangouts be where will they sleep where will you keep their food and water dishes figure out who gets what closets and storage space before you move in so you can keep your new household organized from the get go make a plan for sharing extra spaces like a nook that can be a study craft room or reading nook depending on how you want to use it share the space and don t dictate don t make the experience regretful by being a control freak make sure everyone has their own contribution to the home one person shouldn t take over both of you should feel at home allow the person with fewer items to contribute by giving them the freedom to select decorations layout or even to decorate their own personal space for example office reading nook gym area etc,Family-Life
how to put a friend or relative out of your house,being called upon to help a friend or relative out during tough times is a situation many find themselves in most of us are glad to help for a short period of time at least should you find yourself in the position where you have a house guest that turns into a long term roommate it can be difficult to evict them without drama,determine why you want them to leave you need to be clear with your own reasoning before diving into the conversation review any agreements you made when they moved in or any promises that have been made broken assess the situation and their current behavior grounding your reasoning in fact while i don t like living with them is an acceptable reason to ask someone to move you want concrete details like they never do the dishes they said they would leave months ago etc before talking to them write down the issues as they occur along with the date you want a detailed specific record of their behavior in case things get difficult this conversation will not be easy and it will more than likely damage your relationship however living together with serious differences or issues will also hurt your friendship so you need to take a stand if they ve been there too long speak with a reasonable and respectful tone of voice although you may be feeling violated fed up or sick and tired it is important not to explode and make unreasonable demands lay out your reasons for asking them to leave and let them know that you understand how hard this is speak to them as you would a co worker sticking to the facts and not emotional outbursts say we ve enjoyed having you but we unfortunately need our space back and have to ask you to leave in the next two weeks depending on the reason why they are staying with you you may need to gather information on community assistance services to help them move out in time if they are at risk for living in their car or on the streets help them get in contact with emergency homeless prevention services they may even be able to get temporary housing stick to the reasons you drafted earlier if they ve been a problem or broken promises remind them that they have not held up their end of the bargain and need to move on to a new environment provide detailed impersonal examples of why they need to leave do not respond with because i hate you or because you re lazy give them tangible examples instead of insulting them this is where a list will come in handy if they are a constant source of issues write down each incident and the date as they arise when they ask why mention 2 3 specific times where they broke a promise or caused you trouble focus on your reasons for asking them to leave not all of their flaws whenever possible we need more space we can t afford to keep you here anymore etc provide a firm date they need to leave by telling them that they need to leave that night may cause incredible stress and tension and your friend or relative may not have anywhere to go instead choose a date they need to leave by and let them know that this is a firm deadline in general try and give at least 1 2 weeks or until the end of the month so that they have some time to prepare for their next move i d like you completely moved out by april 20th if there is a legitimate reason why that date is bad you can talk with them to find a better day however don t shift by more than 3 5 days seek out information or alternatives as a good will gesture if you have the resources compile some ideas to help your guest s relocation process you can even bring these with you to the discussion letting them know that they need to leave but that there are options available they may reject your ideas but showing that you still care about their well being can soften the blow be firm clear and consistent about your decision once you ve decided to put them out hold your ground this conversation could get messy and emotions will flair up no matter how prepared you are you need to stand firm however and stick to your decision if your housemate convinces you to change your mind they ll realize that they can continue breaking rules and promises without ever changing if things are so bad that you re going to put them out you need to be ready to really put them out understand that this may damage or ruin your relationship putting out a friend or relative is stressful and will most likely lead to lingering hard feelings ultimately however you need to remember that keeping them in your house for too long can damage your relationship just as much if you are constantly in conflict your friend relative is taking advantage of you or you are simply incompatible living partners then your relationship will only turn toxic if you stay under the same roof that said there are ways to try and keep your friendship alive you can help them find their new place or job avoid insults even in tense situations if they are angry stay calm and reiterate why it is important to you that they find a new place to live don t start slinging insults set up times to meet have them over for dinner and continue seeing each other as friends if you get into a big fight or have serious disagreements then it may be best to cut them off completely send a certified letter asking them to leave in 30 days or less while a house guest is not technically a tenant certain tenant landlord laws still apply to the relationship if they ve been with your for more than 30 days 1 x research source talk to an attorney who will help you draft and send an eviction notice giving this advance warning in writing is essential to protect your liability this warning will legally establish them as an at will tenant you need this status if you have to pursue legal action so do not skip it be wary how you word the letter so that they can t use tenant laws to prevent you from evicting them check your individual state s policies and make it clear what type of living arrangement you had with the person especially if they are not paying any rent file an official tenant eviction order with your local courts if they still won t leave you can take them to court if they paid for groceries or any bills they may legally be an at will tenant making it much harder to kick them out legally 2 x research source if they ignore the first written warning you ll need to file a formal eviction proceedings with your local district court in order to get them out 3 x research source generally your letter will outline a place for them to receive their belongings in the event that they don t move as well as the specific date their stuff will be removed from your house 4 x research source do not change the locks unless you are worried about your safety if you suddenly lock out an at will tenant especially if their belongings are still in the house you could be the target of costly civil suits and legal action changing the locks on a guest if it causes problems or cuts them off from their property can even get you jail time in the wrong circumstances moreover it often inflames already high tensions and can lead to further issues 5 x research source once you have a court order and or have notified the police that you are worried about your safety you can safely change your locks call the police if they still refuse to leave unless they are a legitimate resident of the house usually determined if they receive mail or are on the lease they can be removed from your property as a trespasser obviously involving the police is for the most extreme cases and even the mentioning of 911 is often enough to finally get someone out the door some police offices will refuse to get involved in a matter like this however if you ve sent the letter and or filed for eviction with a court they will come remove your guest as a trespasser set your rules and boundaries early on if you start to get the feeling someone is becoming more of a roommate and less of a visitor set some ground rules as soon as possible this gives you something to stand on when you eventually need to kick them out you can point back to the concrete rules laid down earlier instead of getting emotional set your expectations within the first week do they need to pay rent do they have to be pursuing job interviews have clear benchmarks for them to meet if they want to stay in the house a written and signed informal contract is the best way to set the rules and guidelines and what each of you expects it s even better to have the document notarized most banks offer free notaries to those who bank there make a timeline for their departure before formally asking them to leave sit down and ask when they plan on moving out put the ball in their court which makes it easier to stick to this move out date as it approaches if they don t have a timeline in mind you should make one together come up with something concrete such as when they get a job or after 6 months if they need a job work together to come up with specific goals to reach for applying to one job a day rewriting their resume etc make sure they are actually trying to get a job and not just enjoying the free bed make notes of issues and problems as they arise if your friend or relative is breaking the rules being disrespectful or going back on their promises to you write down the incident along with the date and time in a small notebook again this gives you specifics to bring up when you talk to them about leaving instead of vague generalities or emotional appeals keep this as impersonal as possible asking them to leave doesn t have to ruin a friendship especially if you base your reasons in facts instead of feelings help them get back on their feet some people will get out on their own with a bit of careful nudging read over their resumes and cover letters as they apply to jobs visit open houses with them and encourage them to spread out and become independent if you can help someone become self sufficient they may leave without causing a conflict review their goals and promises together regularly working together to make them a reality if you can help finance their new move this may be all they need to get going 7 x research source,Family-Life

how to sue child protective services,each state has its own child protective services cps agency that is responsible for protecting the health and welfare of children cps investigations can be traumatic and stressful for both parents and children however emotional distress alone does not give you the right to sue cps since cps social workers are government agents they cannot act in ways that violate your established civil rights an overzealous cps worker may violate your constitutional right to due process or your protection from unreasonable search and seizure when that happens you may be able to sue for monetary damages 1 x research source,create a chronological outline of events beginning with your first encounter with cps draft an account of each encounter or communication you ve had with cps social workers and other staff members 2 x research source write down the names job titles and direct contact information of every individual at cps who contacted you or communicated with you in any way you also want outlines of any other activities that have anything to do with your children or the reasons cps became involved with your children gather any related documents and other evidence you should already have been documenting every interaction you had with cps all of these records are now evidence you can use in your lawsuit 3 x research source if you had written documents that you can no longer locate make a note of them cps should have copies as well and you can request them later you also want to gather any documents that have anything to do with the care of your children for example if you re home schooling your children gather school schedules assignments and curricula and make copies consult an attorney civil rights lawsuits in federal court are notoriously complicated if you ve decided to sue cps for violating your constitutional rights you need an experienced civil rights attorney to represent you 4 x research source civil rights attorneys typically offer a free initial consultation so you can use this opportunity to speak to several attorneys that can help you choose the best attorney for your case these lawsuits can drag on for a long time pick an attorney who is passionate about your case and who you get along with you ll be spending a lot of time with them and discussing some potentially sensitive issues if you have been brought up on criminal charges of child abuse or neglect you may already have a criminal defense lawyer ask them for a referral to a civil rights attorney who can help you sue cps identify an established right the first hurdle you ll face is pointing to a specific established constitutional right that cps violated while working with you and your children this is a legal argument your attorney will review your documents and notes to determine which of your civil rights have been violated in your situation 5 x research source this is part of the reason documenting all of your interactions with cps is so important something that seems unfair to you may not necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional violation however something you thought insignificant might actually be a big deal calculate your damages you may have heard of parents who sued cps for hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars however the amount of money must be directly related to the violation of your rights 6 x research source your attorney will start with actual damages if you have any for example if you and your spouse have been seeing a counselor as a result of the trauma you experienced from dealing with cps that expense may be considered actual damages additional damages known as punitive damages may be available to you if the actions of the cps social workers involved in your case were particularly egregious file a complaint typically complaints are not extremely detailed however a complaint in federal court that alleges violations of civil rights requires more information than the typical complaint if the violations aren t explained correctly the lawsuit may be thrown out this is why you need an experienced civil rights attorney 7 x research source you don t have to prove anything or submit any evidence when you file your complaint at this point you re merely making allegations your attorney will file your complaint in the federal district court that has jurisdiction over the county where the cps agency is located you may have to pay the 400 filing fee or your attorney may pay it and add the amount to the costs of your lawsuit have cps served with the complaint once your complaint is filed cps must be notified of the lawsuit so that it has the opportunity to respond your attorney typically will have the complaint served on the attorneys of record for cps 8 x research source evaluate the response from cps when cps is served with your complaint the agency has a limited period of time to file an answer with the court a copy of that written answer will be delivered to your attorney 9 x research source your attorney will go over the response with you typically the answer will deny all of the allegations and raise the defense of qualified immunity the response from cps may include a motion for summary judgment similar to a motion to dismiss this motion argues you have failed to state a claim for which the court can provide any legal or monetary relief attend the summary judgment hearing when you sue cps the agency will likely raise the defense of qualified immunity while technically a defense if the court grants the agency and its social workers qualified immunity you won t be able to sue the agency at all 10 x research source when cps argues it is entitled to qualified immunity the judge must hold a hearing to decide this question before you can move forward with the lawsuit until this matter is decided you won t be able to do any further work or information gathering on your lawsuit your attorney and the attorneys for cps will submit lengthy briefs to the court arguing both sides of the issue the judge may decide the question after reading these briefs or they may have a hearing in court if the judge denies cps qualified immunity you still may not be able to move forward to the next stage of litigation cps has the right to appeal that decision and argue to an appellate court that the agency is entitled to qualified immunity send written questions and requests to cps provided the judge rules that cps is not entitled to qualified immunity you will proceed to the discovery phase you will work with your attorney to create written questions and requests for documents which must be answered by cps 11 x research source you will request cps s entire case file related to your family as well as any internal documents including emails that are related to the investigation of your family the documents and answers to questions may reveal additional problems or violations that you didn t know about before depose the social workers involved a deposition is an interview under oath since so much of your case relies on the subjective beliefs and interpretations of the social workers involved these depositions will be crucial 12 x research source you may or may not need to attend the deposition your attorney may want you there or they may decide that it s better if you re not there regardless of whether you attend your attorney will go over the deposition with you afterward and explain how it affects your case prepare for your own deposition the attorneys for cps will likely want to depose you as well your attorney will meet with you at least once to go over likely questions you ll be asked and explain to you how to respond to deposition questions 13 x research source generally you want to answer the questions directly and honestly but refrain from rambling or further conversation for example if you are asked a yes no question your answer would be yes or no without elaboration answer questions from cps just as you sent written questions to cps the agency will likely send written questions for you to answer as well your attorney will draft the specific answers after consultation with you 14 x research source your attorney may object to some of the questions if they do they ll explain to you why you don t have to answer those questions even though these questions are in writing they are still considered to be under oath answer each question as honestly and accurately as you can if you don t remember something don t guess participate in pre trial hearings judges typically schedule numerous hearings to make sure the litigation is on track and progressing on schedule you won t have to attend many of these hearings or meetings personally your attorney will update you on what happened 15 x research source evaluate any settlement offers lawsuits in federal court seldom make it to trial discovery can drag on for months and most litigants prefer settling the case to avoid the uncertainty of trial the judge may encourage settlement talks or preside over a settlement conference 16 x research source any settlement offers from cps will be communicated to your attorney your attorney will present the offer to you and offer their advice regardless of what your attorney recommends the decision of whether to accept or reject the settlement is solely your own,Family-Life

one really unforgivable thing or you re ready to walk away from a pattern of abusive behavior sometimes cutting ties with your family member is the best thing you can do for your mental health it s

nice once in awhile and they might genuinely love you they might even be a really good person in other areas of their life however this doesn t mean that the relationship is healthy for you 1 x research source if you get a negative feeling every time you think about a person even if they re usually nice to you it may be because they ve hurt you so deeply that you have a hard time moving on in this case you might want to take a little time away from them to focus on yourself don t rationalize the person s behavior it doesn t matter why they did what they did or whether they re sorry if it s a pattern of an ongoing unhealthy relationship and you feel you d be better off without that person in your life you have to make the choice that s right for you 2 x research source for example if someone is frequently unkind to you don t rationalize their behavior by saying something like he must have had a bad day or she s been under a lot of stress lately similarly don t blame abuse on yourself by saying things like if i hadn t accused him of lying he wouldn t have hit me on the other hand if someone who is generally very nice to you snaps or says something short tempered once in a while it s fine to take their circumstances into consideration consider other family who might be affected part of the reason that family relationships are so complicated is because of the number of people involved when you re deciding whether to cut a person out of your life you have to take the rest of the family into account since it may affect your relationships with them as well however sometimes this is unavoidable 3 x research source if you re cutting ties with one parent it might affect your relationship with the other parent if you have trouble with a sibling you might lose contact with your niece or nephew also you might be uninvited from family holidays or other events where the other family member may be present however there will likely be some family members who choose to support you so don t let this be your only deciding factor never demand or expect other family members to cut off their relationship with a person just because you do take a step back from a one way relationship if you notice that whenever you talk to your family member it s all about them rather than being a give and take conversation it s likely a toxic relationship this narcissistic behavior is unlikely to change and you re probably better off keeping your contact with that person to a more superficial level 4 x research source in a situation like this you may notice that the person uses you for emotional comfort during their troubles but then becomes dismissive of you when you talk about the things in your life that are stressful the same is true for someone who only talks to you when they need something from you like money or advice 5 x research source get distance from family members who feed off of drama if there s someone in your family who s always at the center of conflict or who loves spilling other people s secrets it can be hard to have a healthy relationship with them you don t necessarily have to completely cut off your drama loving kin but you re probably better off if you keep them at arm s length a person who loves drama often alternates between acting like your best friend and then pushing you away if you criticize or contradict them 6 x research source if someone in your family spreads gossip about you this is definitely someone to stay away from the same is true if a person is frequently dishonest avoid people who always make you feel stressed or unhappy whether it s an aunt who always criticizes your weight or your sister who always jokes about how she s so much more successful than you you have every right to avoid being around anyone who makes you feel bad if you find that you get stressed out just thinking about being in the same room as a person avoid situations where you know you ll see them 7 x research source sometimes a temporary break in a relationship like this can help soothe your hurt feelings however if the person s behavior persists you might be better off cutting ties permanently especially if you find yourself thinking about the things they said even when they re not around if a person denies that they said something hurtful or they try to justify their behavior then they re unlikely to change in the future and you should stay away from them 8 x research source walk away from any relationship that is abusive any relationship can become abusive whether it s a parent grandparent sibling or even a distant relative in addition abuse can come in a number of different forms ranging from being constantly put down or yelled at to being hit kicked or sexually abused if you feel like you re being abused you should get away from that person as soon as you possibly can 9 x research source other signs of abuse include the silent treatment controlling behavior or constantly being blamed for things you didn t do if you re a child and you re being abused by a parent you should find a trusted adult that you can confide in this might be another family member or it could be a counselor or teacher at your school there are also helplines you can call like 1 800 4 a child in the us or 0800 1111 in the uk 10 x research source you may also choose to end a relationship with someone whom you believe has abused your child if you re a parent take a time out if you don t want to permanently end the relationship sometimes you just need a little time away from a person before you can forgive them for something hurtful they did this is especially true if you re normally very close with the person and they did something that was thoughtless you might even be able to do this without having to confront the person directly 11 x research source if you need some space try telling your family member that you re busy but you ll catch up soon once you cool off a little consider letting them know how much they hurt you so they can make amends and keep from doing the same thing in the future meet on neutral ground if you can t avoid seeing the person if for some reason it s not practical to cut ties completely with your family member try meeting in a public space when you need to talk ask them to join you at a coffee shop park or restaurant where either of you can walk away if you need to 12 x research source talking to your grandmother in the house she s lived in for 35 years will leave her feeling like she has the upper hand and you ll be less likely to get your point across on the other hand having a confrontation in your home can make you feel like your safe space has been violated especially if the other person doesn t leave when you ask them to stay calm if you decide to talk to the person face to face once you make the decision to cut ties with the person who hurt you you may decide to have a talk with them to let them know this let the person know that you no longer plan to visit and you won t be answering their phone calls or other attempts to contact you these conversations can be emotional and explosive but try to stay calm and keep in mind that soon this drama will be a part of the past if you have a chance it may help you stay calm if you plan out what you re going to say ahead of time 13 x research source if you have been thinking about the fact that you don t want to participate in a toxic relationship anymore and your family member does something to push your buttons you may not have time to plan what you re going to say go ahead and tell them that you need some space start the conversation with something like i ve decided it s best for my own mental health if i don t spend time around you anymore if the person gets very upset you could say i don t want to argue i just need some space right now because i don t feel like this is a healthy relationship anymore then leave as soon as possible send an email or a letter if you want to plan out your words if you want to tell the person how you feel and you re afraid you ll have trouble expressing yourself in person try writing out what you really want to say let them know that you plan on taking some time away from them consider making a copy of the letter so you can reference it if they claim you said something you didn t say 14 x research source writing a letter or email is an especially good option if the family member has a history of twisting your words interrupting you when you talk or becoming physically aggressive when they re upset it s up to you whether you want to let them know exactly what they did wrong or if you would rather just give them an overview like saying i m tired of your hurtful words followed by a lack of apologies be clear and straightforward about wanting to have distance from the person whether you re talking in person or you re writing a letter you don t want to leave this conversation open ended even if down the road you decide you can forgive your family member they won t take you seriously if they think you re just complaining say something like i don t want to see you or hear from you if you have children set clear boundaries as to whether your family member can contact them as well be aware they may try to manipulate you or others your family member may lash out after the conversation they may spread rumors about you try to get other family members not to speak to you or try to manipulate you into repairing the relationship if you re prepared for this ahead of time you ll be more likely to stay strong 15 x research source your family member might even be genuinely sad about your decision to cut ties with them just remember that you should never be guilted into being around someone who makes you unhappy talk about what happened to someone you trust finding someone to confide in is essential when you re dealing with the end of a relationship you might have trouble finding other family members to talk to since they might feel caught in the middle so try talking to a close friend 16 x research source it also may be a good idea to talk to a counselor since toxic family relationships can have long lasting effects on your self esteem practice a routine of self care once you remove a toxic person from your life you should seek to fill that space with positive activities that you love everyone s self care looks different but it s important for you to do the things that make you feel happy and self confident this might mean soaking in a hot tub taking up a new hobby or going back to school 17 x research source acknowledge your strengths especially if your family member regularly put you down if you need to write down a list of the best things about yourself and put it somewhere you ll see it every day don t dwell on what you wish you had it can be hard sometimes to see other happy families or to think back to what your family looked like before the negativity occurred just keep in mind that even a family that looks perfect from the outside can have its own problems and focus on the good things you do have in your life 18 x research source for instance you might have a poor relationship with your children but you might have an excellent support system in your church set healthy boundaries in future relationships you might not be able to choose your family but you can choose who you spend time around and you don t have to put up with hurtful behavior use this experience to teach you what you will and will not accept from the people in your life and be firm about those boundaries in the future 19 x research source for instance if you finally decided you had enough of your brother calling you names your whole life then you certainly don t have to put up with a date doing it practice if then statements in case you find yourself in a similar situation in the future for examples you might tell yourself if someone says something about me that isn t true then i will speak up immediately because that s not acceptable let the person back into your life slowly if you choose to at all the decision of whether or not to mend your relationship with this person is up to you if you do decide that eventually you would like to let this person back into your life take your time let them prove to you that they can build a new healthy relationship with you when you re establish contact have a conversation where you make your boundaries clear say something like i will not ever tolerate you making disrespectful comments about my weight if you do that again i will leave and not come back if you see the person falling back into old habits back away again if the person has been abusive to you it may be best not to allow them back into your life,Family-Life

complementary activity to ease your discomfort for example if you are sad you might want to watch a funny movie if you are angry it might be helpful to vent to a friend or engage in intense physical activity resist the urge to point the finger accusing someone of being the cause of the problem will only result in the person becoming defensive and otherwise hindering a productive exchange always

might not be open weigh possible negative consequences it s also a good idea to anticipate how you expect them to react of course you don t know them but perhaps recounting the details of why you were separated in the first place can help you determine how a possible reunion would play out 2 x research source for example if you were the secret love child of a married man your introduction to half siblings might lead to everyone finding out about an instance of infidelity if your half siblings are from a wealthy background they might distrust your motives assuming you want something from them in addition if your half siblings are young and your biological parent is still married it may be very upsetting for them to learn that their parent s marriage consisted of this betrayal get the advice of your parents if possible if either of your parents is alive or in your life talking to them may assist with your decision making they may not approve of your desire to connect with your half siblings or they may have some insights about your relatives that haven t been previously shared choose a time when everyone is feeling relaxed present and free of distractions and approach the

person to contact your half siblings on your behalf you might say could you please reach out to harry and beth for me if they are interested i d love to talk to them here s my number message them on social media social media has made the world so much smaller people who currently live across the globe from one another are accessible with the click of a cursor if you are able to find your half

might know some of the same people send an email if you can locate full names of your half siblings you might be able to find a personal or work email account listed for them in some cases people

several attempts just in case previous messages or emails were lost or went to a spam folder however if you don t receive a reply after a few tries this might be a sign that your half siblings aren t interested in meeting you even if they do seem interested initially there s still a possibility that the connection could fall flat try not to read too much into their interest early on to prevent feeling overly disappointment when they suddenly stop returning messages or calls 7 x research source feel your feelings but don t take rejection personally you made a brave decision to reach out to

feelings to make you think any less of yourself 8 x research source keep in mind that your half siblings don t actually know you therefore their rejection is likely related to their own fear or surprise of your existence than any concerns about who you are as a person if you have loved ones that value your presence in their lives cherish their relationships and tell yourself it s their loss

how to solve your family problems,most of us have been there families can be very difficult and family problems are very painful however there are ways to solve family problems and restore peace to the dynamic life is too short to waste time bogged down with negativity towards the people you love how you approach the family member and what you say can make a big difference,wait until you re not angry to discuss this problem family problems can be very painful especially around family centered times like holidays if your family members are arguing waiting until everyone is calm can help keep the argument from escalating into a full blown feud don t discuss the family problem when you re still feeling upset or emotional if you wait even a single night the intensity of the emotion is likely to subside somewhat even if you re still unhappy waiting allows you to approach the issue logically rather than emotionally if you take a step back and give yourself some time to think before dealing with the issue you won t deal with it so reactively approaching someone when you are angry will heighten the intensity around an already tough situation there s no reason you can t wait to make your point tomorrow so control your instant impulse deal with family problems in person we ve all been there we ve all sent off a text or email that we wish we could take back trying to address an argument or family problem by instant messenger or email is the worst possible choice in person discussions improve your ability awareness and inclination to filter that s because tone can too easily be misperceived by electronic communication you might not think you sound angry but you might sound angry by text to the person receiving it instead of sending off a text pick up the telephone or better yet arrange an in person meeting electronic communication means people lose the touchstones of body language which can convey empathy and reduce the sting of a painful conversation people say things by electronic communication that they would never say to another person s face which is another reason to avoid it accept everyone s faults including your own they say that blood is thicker than water and that you can choose your friends but not your family you might be able to cut people out but it could cause you more pain down the road understanding that family members have faults but you can still love them is the first step toward addressing longstanding problems try to understand why they might act or think the way they do as it can be a reflection of themselves rather than you accept your own faults too accept blame when you deserve it try not to see family issues as all or nothing equations where someone is wrong and someone else perhaps you is right instead try to perceive the gray areas nuances are exciting it can do wonders to be the first person to apologize even if you really truly don t think you did anything wrong say something like i can see you re upset and although this has been hard for me too i am sorry i really want to fix this so let me know how i can do that that way if the family member continues the feud at least you can say you took the high road avoid the blame game keep your language positive when you talk to your family avoid using language that puts blame on any of your family members or that feels negative negativity is a vicious cycle 1 x research source that means avoiding judgment words or name calling of the family member it means avoiding accusatory words that are said in an angry tone blaming other people will make them defensive and prone to counter attacking which will make the argument worse avoid the need to win the argument about the family problem instead try to accept that there are two or more ways to see the point develop a plan for solving the problem together then focus on organizing activities where you can have fun together avoiding anything that could serve as a trigger reigniting the problem explore new sides of your family members and new ways of relating to them keep your tone and voice calm and modulated not raised and upset calmly and methodically explain your points but with empathy for the other person always try to put yourself in the family member s shoes make attempts to cool down the argument by throwing out conciliatory comments like i see your point forgive any family members that have wronged you this can be a very difficult thing to achieve it is very hard to forgive a person family member or not whom we think has wronged us with family members such feelings can run even deeper however ultimately forgiveness is about freeing yourself from the corrosive nature of the dispute forgiving the family member is about letting go of the past so you can build a healthier future that is free of tension and stress tell the family member you forgive him or her if the family member has readily admitted blame for whatever is causing the problem say this with empathy it will go a long way remember that every human being is imperfect and needing of forgiveness at one time or another on life s journey that s including you probably at some point identify the real problem try to figure out what is really going on perhaps you are struggling with health problems or personal problems that you have been hiding from your family or maybe you are all grieving over a loved one who has passed away consider the real issue at hand as this will allow you to then better address it you may need to engage in some self analysis here why am i hiding my issue from my family why am i so upset at this family issue for example perhaps you are struggling with financial concerns over how your mother is spending her money you may then realize that you are concerned because you do not want her to end up with no way to support herself financially as you do not have the means to provide for her don t assume what other people are thinking you need to talk to them to find out what they are really thinking avoid gossiping about other people in the family as this will probably get back to them and make it worse focus on causes not symptoms 2 x research source however a trusted family member such as a parent or another sibling might be able to help you figure out what is really going on so it s ok to talk to them in a way that is heartfelt and designed to solve or address the issue ask questions to draw out the family member a good technique for digging out the root causes of family problems is to ask questions rather than making statements statements can feel judging to people putting them on the defensive in contrast asking questions softens the conversation and can draw out what s really bothering the person questions make the family member feel like he or she is not being condemned ask the other family member his or her ideas for making the situation better for example let s say that your sister has been really distant from you lately and not inviting you out for coffee like she used to you could say i ve noticed that we haven t seen each as much as we used to why do you think that is or you may try to address your mother s spending habits by saying i ve noticed that you have been spending more money on clothing lately are you being responsible with money make sure the questions are open ended so that they provoke the other person to elaborate then truly listen to what the family member has to say open a line of communication poor communication is involved in many if not most family problems 3 x research source shutting out the family member in question or shutting down can be a big problem it s hard to solve a family problem if you re not talking be the person who reaches out first no matter how hard that is perhaps an older wiser family member can be asked to intervene and set up a meeting or talk to the other family member first acting as sort of a mediator in order to open the line of communication you will have to set aside your pride remember it takes a big person to be the first person to tackle the problem 4 x research source ignoring the problem while it festers will probably only make it worse in the long run as the coldness grows between you it s better to express how you feel but choose the right time and way to do so for example it may be a bad idea to bring up a family problem at the thanksgiving dinner table avoid drinking before having a tough family conversation alcohol can fuel emotions in a lot of people even when used in moderation and that s usually not the best thing when trying to have a difficult family conversation recognize when family problems need to be discussed when has a family problem risen to the point that it needs to be addressed there are clear signs of family and relationship problems that have gotten out of control and need to be discussed including frequent arguing disagreements angry outburst avoidance of others ostracizing of some family members and in the worst cases physical conflicts 5 x research source some family problems can be caused by differences of opinion such as differing cultural values or beliefs parents and children may end up not able to agree on lifestyle choices and personal preferences or beliefs other family problems stem from substance abuse mental health problems bullying lack of trust change in family circumstances financial issues stress sexuality related issues and jealousy try to reach a compromise compromising means that you come up with a solution that both people can feel okay about even if neither gets exactly what he or she wants a compromise is a good way to defuse a dispute or to address a family problem the first step is trying to figure out whether the problem is solvable that depends on the nature of the problem and what s already been done to solve it if you ve tried and tried and keep getting the same result that may be different but consider what points of common ground you have with the other person and what points you would be willing to give in on if you don t give in on anything you re less likely to make headway in the dispute one technique to develop compromise is for both people in the dispute to sit down and draw two circles that relate to the family problem in the first circle write down everything you re not willing to compromise on in the outer circle write down the areas where you are willing to bend then share the circles talk to family members one on one there are some families that don t function well as a group we ve all been in dysfunctional groups where there s a negative dynamic at play sometimes this comes out when everyone s together instead of broaching painful family problems at holiday gatherings or a big family dinner try to figure out who the conflict is really between if it s between you and one other family member the rest of the family may feel very uncomfortable being dragged into it because no one likes to be forced to take a side instead ask the family member in question to meet you for lunch or coffee talking one on one in a neutral space can be a much better way to redress whatever grievances you have or they might have people will say things individually that they would hesitate to say in a group don t try talking to the family member when you re distracted working on a big work project fielding a bunch of phone calls doing the dishes or the like instead put everything down to focus on the issue and them call a family council although a lot of disputes can be handled best one on one there can be times where you would want to get the entire family together to address a problem this approach is best if the problem affects the entire family rather than stemming from an interpersonal conflict with a few family members for example perhaps the family problem involves a job loss disability or money problems calling the family together to come up with ideas to solve the problem helps everyone feel like they are doing something useful use the family council as the foundation to develop a strategy to move the family forward in a positive manner more minds are usually better at tackling a problem than one is make sure one family member doesn t dominate the discussion and explain that anger or name calling should be checked at the door write a letter to the family member although electronic communication often seems too terse and impersonal a heartfelt handwritten letter can go a long way when addressing tough situations handwriting is good because it s more personal it shows that you put care and thought behind the letter and it seems warmer that will make the other family members realize that you are trying some people communicate better in writing but veil their thoughts and emotions more in person or on the phone if you are one of those people a letter might be the way to go in the letter you should explain how you feel and why you want to address the family issue use the word i more than the word you in the letter so you are stating your perspective and not blaming or speaking for anyone else explain how the problem is affecting you but also explain how you would like the problem to be resolved and why address a family problem with a child sometimes your children can be the source of family problems whether it s acting disrespectfully arguing with siblings or not doing their chores you may want to deal with the issue a little differently if the child is very young 6 x research source place the problem in front of the child explain the problem very clearly you might say something like we have noticed that you don t get out of bed easily making you late for school a lot this is a problem that we need to solve don t act angry instead ask the child for help solving the problem suggest that the child come up with a plan to solve the issue with your help give the child positive reinforcement if the child makes progress toward solving the problem try to dig out the real reasons for the problem is the child hard to wake up because the child is on social media too late for example don t play favorites with children let the child know you love the child and that you want to solve the problem because you care about the child and want things to be better establish boundaries if family members are toxic and they are causing harm to you or constant drama in your life there is nothing wrong with drawing boundaries and setting limits in fact this can be a healthy thing to do the question to ask yourself is whether the family member has brought negatives into your life draining you emotionally stealing from you financially undermining you or any number of bad behaviors you have a right to draw boundaries to protect yourself for example perhaps you still see the negative family member at family events and you treat them with respect when you do however perhaps you have decided to never visit with them one on one or lend them money this is within your right to do explain the boundaries to the family member in a warm and loving manner however be firm perhaps you can t stay over at a family member s house because fights always occur when you visit so you will stay at a nearby hotel instead know when it s time to step back there are some family problems that simply cannot be fixed some family problems also take time to solve you may realize it is truly healthier for you to cut the family member out of your life for now sad as that might be to admit some family problems like grief over a loved one or a parents inability to accept you for who you are may not have solutions instead you may need to accept that you have tried your best to communicate and connect with your family to no avail you may then need to move on from the issue and try to live your life the best you can although such situations are intensely personal generally you should consider cutting the family member out of your life if the family problem involves abuse either physical or sexual abuse should not be tolerated of yourself or others abuse situations should be reported to the police or child protective services 7 x research source serious substance abuse issues that continue to impact your life could be another reason you can try to get a person help but if they continue to refuse you might have to cut them out for your own peace of mind seek counseling it s not for everybody but some family problems are so deeply felt and toxic that they can only be solved by a professional it s worth a try if nothing else has worked and there is nothing to be ashamed about by seeking help if the family member in question will not go to counseling perhaps you could go on your own a professional therapist can help you figure out how to deal with the family member and how to heal the rift reading books on relationships also can help some people as can joining a support group 8 x research source if the family problem is rooted in issues like mental illness or substance abuse by you or another family member a professional may be the only way for the family to start to heal some problems may be too complex for you to solve on your own a counselor can help by simply being a neutral objective ear on the problem the professional might offer suggestions that you didn t think of or perceive aspects of the conflict that you wouldn t because you are too close to it,Family-Life

curricular activities after school so you won t have to be at dinner with your rude younger brother change the topic if you get into an uncomfortable conversation many times rude people are simply trying to get attention by eliciting a reaction if you know what topics she enjoys evoking avoid them by bridging to a more neutral conversation that won t require her opinion or reaction for example

like to read more about before i place my vote speaking of reading i read an article on how to build a really great deck how long did it take you to build yours if it is a family member that you have

break away and start an activity large family gatherings may need people to help supervise children prepare the meal or clean the location delegating a job that he enjoys will keep him occupied for example ask for help with your car home renovation tips or playing sports with the kids be careful not to include him in an activity where he could offend more people if you ask him to participate in

yourself as equals scheduling around her can ensure that she doesn t feel blind sided or rushed for a response scheduling shows that you are considerate of her time and that you have thought about this conversation enough to prioritize it empathize with his situation be objective and don t let any emotions cloud your judgment make it a priority to get to know your family member more before you confront him perhaps he is rude because he had a tough upbringing or because he feels insecure about his accomplishments relatives to the rest of the family 6 x research source don t broach difficult topics by becoming rude yourself for example if she often references how much you make compared to her let her know that you know how hard it s been for her and her family offer advice and let her know that you know where she s coming from with an example of how you had to move up to get to where you are financially say something like am i misreading you you re coming off very rude please let me know if i m misinterpreting what you re saying or let me know why you re upset i m here to listen and make sure i understand what you re saying ask relatives who have a better rapport with him to confront him about his behavior family dynamics can be complex so seek out the best person suited to confront your rude family member use other family members as a buffer speak to his closest

how to cope with a dysfunctional family,it is never easy to cope with a dysfunctional family family dysfunction can drain your emotional and physical energy family get togethers may be very difficult and managing conflict may feel impossible to cope learn to set boundaries and avoid subjects that cause disagreement limit contact with family members that cause problems and learn to put yourself first remember your emotional needs and well being should be valued when coping with a dysfunctional family know and stand up for your own rights,keep your expectations realistic dysfunctional families may be resistant to change when going into a family situation work on keeping your expectations in check if you accept that some conflict and difficulty is inevitable you may be less frustrated by disagreement 1 x research source know your most difficult family members limit the amount of time you spend with these people if your mother for instance tends to be the cause of drama keep your distance do not expect a dramatic change breaking free of a cycle of dysfunction is difficult if it does happen it will take time go into the event knowing it will likely be difficult at the same time do be open to the possibility that it might be okay don t foreshadow events by deciding that they will be terrible hope for the best prepare for the worst take someone with you to family events having a buffer can help you cope ask a friend or romantic partner to accompany you to support you emotionally during family functions 2 x research source your family may be on better behavior in the presence of an outsider is there anyone you could invite maybe a friend of yours does not have christmas plans see if they want to join your family s festivities give your buffer a fair warning however let them know your family can be difficult at times limit alcohol alcohol tends to fuel emotion if your family is difficult by nature too much alcohol could lead to an increase in conflict 3 x research source there may be problem drinkers in your family if this is the case it s a good idea to call family members and request an alcohol free get together try to provide other beverages like sparkling cider instead of alcohol some family members may be uninterested in attending an event without alcohol these people will likely not show up or leave early limiting alcohol can be a great way to keep the more difficult family members away steer the conversation away from conflict if your family fights you can take it upon yourself to limit argument it s frustrating when it s up to you to make sure people get along but sometimes it s inevitable listen to various conversations and work on changing the topic when necessary 4 x research source by now you likely know the topics that trigger drama in your family for instance maybe your uncle john is chronically unemployed due to his drinking he tends to become very sensitive when the topic is raised when you hear the problem topic arising act fast for example maybe your dad says something like john have you applied to any jobs lately it s been what 6 months jump in right away and steer the conversation out of the danger zone you can try to play a game like 20 questions or simply change the subject for example dad actually sarah just applied to a job at a bookstore she s really excited about it it can be helpful to go into the event with a list of safe topics that you think everyone will enjoy maybe jot these down in your phone in case you panic and forget have an escape route at times it s appropriate to walk away if someone is getting hostile or difficult know an excuse you can use to dodge an interaction 5 x research source think of various ways to slip out for a minute you could for example offer to help out in the kitchen or run to the store to get something if you want to leave early think of an excuse you could say you re watching a friend s pet and need to check in on it for example it can be helpful to lay the groundwork for this early say on the front end that you can only stay until whatever determined time and that way people are not offended when you leave let go of some conflicts you do not have control over other people s lives and decisions even if you want a family member to change you cannot do it for them try to avoid becoming emotionally invested in long standing conflicts over which you have little power 6 x research source for instance maybe your mother is always very critical of you and your siblings as a result none of you have much contact with her at family events she continues to be critical and push people away you may wish your mother was different you may want a better relationship with her however keep in mind it s her responsibility to change if she continues to be resistant to altering her behavior there is little you can do for her try your best to emotionally disengage also remember that family events may just not be the right time to address these conflicts know that you can revisit these issues at a later time if you feel it s important that way holidays are not ruined by fighting recognize your own emotional needs you have a right to feel respected and safe in your relationships no one should violate this right the first step to asserting yourself is identifying what you need 7 x research source everyone deserves respect and that includes you you have a right to be around people who bring you up rather than down in a dysfunctional family your thoughts may be skewed you may question whether you deserve respect remind yourself you do think about what behaviors are and are not acceptable for example maybe your father continually criticizing your career choice is not acceptable to you you re proud of what you do regardless of what your father thinks it s well within your rights to assert as much be firm about boundaries in the moment let someone know when they ve crossed a line you do not have to be aggressive or mean you can be respectful while simultaneously making it clear where the line is 8 x research source for example shopping with your mother is always a headache she s very critical of your appearance and tends to scrutinize the clothing you like however she continues to push you to go shopping with her your mother has asked you repeatedly to go shopping this weekend after the third or fourth time she asks state your boundaries clearly say something like mom i love the time we spend together but i think we stress each other out when we go shopping together if you want to get lunch or see a movie some time great but i m not interested in going shopping with you anymore after establishing your boundaries it can be helpful to change the subject this signals to the other party that the boundaries are not up for debate and also suggests that you are not angry with them ask about a mutual friend or if they ve seen any good movies recently use i statements when you assert yourself i statements are statements phrased in a way to reduce blame instead of placing an objective judgment on a situation you emphasize your personal feelings they have 3 parts they begin with i feel after which you immediately state your feelings from there you explain the behavior that led to that feeling lastly you say why you felt the way you did 9 x research source for example you re frustrated that your father has again insulted your girlfriend in front of you you may be inclined to say something like it s incredibly rude to make comments on noel s weight that s completely disrespectful to me and to her this can be rephrased using an i statement say something like i feel disrespected when you make comments on noel s weight because that s an issue she s very sensitive to and i ve explained this to you before lead by example show genuine compassion and concern for your family check in with them regularly and invest in them as people do not let their bad behavior dictate your treatment of them the 2 should exist separately from each other for instance don t respond to a rude family member by being rude in return or by just writing them off try to respond to them with compassion and understanding going tit for tat isn t going to improve the situation walk away when necessary despite your best efforts to assert your needs some people are just very difficult if your family is not responding to your attempts to assert yourself it s okay to leave some situations 10 x research source for example your father is relentless when you tell him to stop disrespecting your girlfriend instead of apologizing he responds you re being hypersensitive i just care about her health you can tell from his tone he s getting hostile it may not be worth it to push the issue at this point your father is getting angry even as you try to respectfully address the situation he s trying to force an argument at this point just walk away say something like this isn t getting us anywhere i m going to go for a walk okay then give yourself some time to cool down see a therapist it s very hard to deal with the emotional toll of a dysfunctional family alone a qualified therapist can help you deal with the damage done by familial dysfunction seek out a therapist in your area to work out your issues 11 x research source you can ask your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist you can also ask your insurance provider to help you find a therapist in your area if you are a student you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university allow yourself to feel angry many people feel they must forgive or let go of bad behavior if your family has been unfair to you it s okay to feel anger it s actually healthy to allow yourself to experience anger when you ve been disrespected or mistreated 12 x research source forgiveness can be the last step in recovery however it is rarely healthy to forgive first you need to put the blame on those causing the problems do not expect yourself to fix problems via forgiveness find productive ways to vent anger talk to close friends or go to support groups you can also write a letter to difficult family members and then burn it work on expressing your emotions if you come from a dysfunctional family you may have difficulty expressing your emotions work on ways to express yourself in a healthy and productive fashion if you re seeing a therapist it may be valuable to talk this over with them 13 x research source stop to identify your emotions several times a day growing up in a dysfunctional family you may have learned to repress or ignore your emotions try to take time to notice what you are feeling also what caused the feeling what are you responding to you can try keeping a journal in which you record your daily feelings you can cope with your emotions by sharing them with others work on finding people who are supportive you should only share your emotions with people who respond with kindness and affirmation learn to trust others this can be one of the hardest parts of coping with a dysfunctional family it may be difficult to trust if you come from a difficult home life start by taking small risks and then build from there 14 x research source practice seeking out the support of healthy people get to know people who are kind and positive building a family of quality friends is extremely important in maintaining self esteem and helping someone cope with family dysfunction you may have difficulty telling others how you re feeling work on getting over this hurdle start by occasionally expressing small needs and wants to those around you you can begin expressing greater needs and wants over time take good care of yourself you may neglect your own self care if you come from a dysfunctional home if you spent a lot of time coping with conflict you may put your own health and well being aside work on practicing basic self care this alone can help you better regulate your emotions 15 x research source you need to do things for yourself make sure you eat healthy meals get exercise and take care of basic hygiene you should also treat yourself on occasion if you need to

how to ask your family for money,family members are often the best choice for helping you with an unexpected expense asking will always feel a little awkward but to make it easier be honest about why you need the money sit down and have a serious discussion with your family about how much money you ll need and how you ll pay it back put the agreement in writing to make sure both you and your family feel comfortable and understand your situation,get your finances in order before asking anyone for money sit down and analyze your money habits pay attention to your bills and how much you re

ask people that you trust for a loan most people go to mom or dad first for money if you have a solid relationship with them great you and the family member you ask need to trust each other thoroughly and feel free to communicate openly asking a distant cousin wouldn t be appropriate unless the 2 of you have this kind of relationship 2 x research source the more trust there is in your relationship with the other person the more likely they ll be to give you a loan you can write a letter or talk on the phone but having a face to face conversation is more effective avoid asking people who aren t financially secure take the time to think about the other person s financial situation asking someone who isn t financially stable isn t in a steady job or has significant medical bills will seem disrespectful try not to pressure someone who is already under a lot of pressure themselves 3 x research source your best friend may be the person you trust most but they aren t the person to ask when

loan and i don t have enough left to pay my rent this month ask the person for the exact amount you need it helps to bring along a copy of the expense such as a bill or rent contract if it s available

go to the concert this weekend create a spending budget for large loans when you need to borrow a lot of money to pay several bills or a business loan take time to describe how you ll allocate the money writing out a clear and concise plan can convince the person that you re responsible this is also a great way to double check that your personal finances are in order 6 x research source for example the budget might say 200 for the electrical bill 100 for groceries and 50 for transportation explain how long you ll need to pay the money back assess your personal budget or business plan to

possible 7 x research source for instance a little bit of money to cover dinner might be paid back within a week but a large business loan can take months or years asking for money should be treated

you re borrowing a large amount you probably won t be able to pay it all back immediately work with your family to establish a basic minimum you ll pay during a set time period such as every month 8 x research source establishing a plan keeps you on track you ll never forget to repay the loan or include it in your budget get creative family members may also count odd jobs such as mowing the lawn as part of your repayment it doesn t hurt to ask offer to pay some interest remember that the other person is taking a risk instead of using this money as they please think of how much interest they d get from keeping the money in the bank for a month come up with a low interest rate such as 1 2 and add it to what you owe every month 9 x research source the interest is a positive way to show appreciation for your family member s assistance come up with consequences for late payment discuss what will happen when you don t make a payment on time this is up to you and your family you might have them remind you of the loan or charge you extra next payment find something that motivates you to stay on track 10 x research source for example you could owe your family a favor or chore such as babysitting your little brother establishing consequences show that you re taking this seriously and can help facilitate open communication about what is otherwise a difficult issue sign a promissory note you can go online and find sample templates to print write down the details you and your family discussed then have everyone sign their names this turns your request into a physical binding agreement 11 x research source a physical copy is useful for making everyone feel comfortable and clearing up any confusion that might arise in the future continue communicating with your family as you repay them stay in contact with your family members call them up from time to time like you normally would to update them on how you re doing if there s any trouble repaying the loan mention that

how to survive with a narcissistic mother,are you being raised or were raised by a mother who seems to think only of her needs before yours whether she realizes it or not a narcissistic mother can cause tremendous damage to a child s self worth and self esteem not to mention the fact that many of your needs may not be met despite being hurt by your self centered mother you can overcome her emotionally absent behavior and develop into a strong caring individual,acknowledge and grieve the loss of never having a true mother a real mother puts her child s physical and emotional needs above her own however if you ve lived or are currently living with a narcissistic mother her needs must be met first 1 x research source don t try to figure out why in some cases your mother was the victim of a narcissistic parent herself or another kind of abuse in other cases perhaps your mother never really grew up and hasn t realized that the world has many more people than her either way this situation is not your fault 2 x research source try not to ponder what if i had a better mom instead consider how you can rise above this challenge and cherish yourself in a way she has never managed wistfully thinking about what could have been if you had a different mother will only make the situation more painful 3 x research source go through the actual grieving process you ve finally realized that your mother will not change and you ve been given a mother who is solely considerate of one person herself give yourself time to grieve so you can move onto healing avoid trying to change your mother perhaps you believe that if you are better behaved or get that big promotion at work your mother will finally recognize you and be proud you ve done nothing wrong but unfortunately any act of greatness will be wasted on a narcissist obtain a strong support system depending on your age surround yourself with caring loving people who truly care about you and your well being if you are still living at home it may be your friends relatives or boyfriend girlfriend adults can turn to their spouse or friends as well 4 x research source if you are an adult and have children don t use their love as a crutch as much as you may want to turn to your child when your mother is upsetting you they can still do that well into adulthood stop yourself and redirect your emotions children will not only misunderstand what you are trying to tell them they may become concerned that the same thing could happen to them if you have trouble securing support consult with a trained therapist who can suggest an actual support group for children of narcissistic mothers 5 x research source distance yourself from your mother as difficult as that may sound getting away from someone like this may be the only way you can move toward 6 x research source healing 7 x research source if you still live at home avoid getting close often narcissistic people will sense when others are pulling away and act as though they are taking interest only to go back to their old ways once they have captivated their audience you try to maintain minimal contact with your mother at home consider her behavior as more of an amusement which is nothing serious and has no weight on your life move away from your mother limited contact will most likely work best for you especially if you live in different towns or states if you find that talking on the phone with your mother gets you upset only take phone calls when you are mentally prepared to deal with her don t allow her to take you off guard upsetting you and ruining your day maintain a level of contact that makes you comfortable if completely abandoning the relationship and never looking back is the only way you can move on do whatever you can to heal however some children still feel guilty completely letting go and may feel obligated to provide financial assistance to their narcissistic mother she is part of your family after all so do allow yourself to provide for her if this is not too weighing on your spirit if this causes you too much of a burden however you are under no obligation to do it do whatever will give you healing from the situation 8 x research source perhaps you could have a casual relationship instead of cutting it off completely this means you could be friendly and make small talk with your mother such as how s the weather the cold has been intense here but avoid anything other than a surface level relationship,Family-Life
how to mediate family arguments,family conflict affects everyone if there is an ongoing dispute between family members you may want to mediate to make everyone s lives easier it s worth it to try to smooth things over encourage everyone to go into the situation with empathy when discussing things make sure everyone s voice is heard let everyone share their point of view try to move forward in the spirit of forgiveness this way you will have a more stable family situation moving forward,think about everyone s perspective before attempting to mediate disagreements make sure you look at all sides of the argument while you shouldn t take sides when attempting to mediate you don t want anyone to think you re overlooking their point of view take some time to think about why everyone feels wronged or hurt in the situation 1 x research source you will have to resist the urge to judge here it can be difficult to look at family situations objectively especially if you re emotionally involved in the conflict try to think about how you would react hearing about the conflict as an outsider examine why both parties feel wronged and hurt consider your family s history and what role if any this plays in the drama also look within yourself have you done or said anything that could have escalated the situation how do you think other family member s felt about some of your actions try acknowledging this out loud such as by saying i shouldn t have raised my voice i am sure it was upsetting for you to hear that acknowledging this out loud and leading by example can set the tone for other people to follow suit you want to behave admirably and have people want to replicate that reflect on how the conflict affects other family members mediating drama can be difficult however it s important to have the strength and resolve to work towards a solution despite the stress of it one way to keep yourself strong is to remind yourself who is getting hurt oftentimes a conflict between two family members affects everyone in the family 2 x research source think about who s caught in the middle for example if your two uncles are fighting maybe their kids are in the middle while all the cousins like to get together once in a while it s become awkward due to the rift between their fathers the fact other family members are affected is something you can use to encourage resolution if the two opposing sides do not want to meet remind them of how their drama adversely affects those around them this may be the push they need to mend fences ask other family members about how they re feeling as a mediator you want to have as nuanced an understanding of the situation as possible the best way to understand someone s point of view is to ask before getting everyone together for a talk ask a variety of family members how they feel about the situation 3 x research source you don t want to engage in bad mouthing however try to encourage everyone to explain why they re feeling the way they do use active listening techniques to emphasize to them that they ve been heard and understood for example uncle dave you seem really tense about seeing uncle clark for thanksgiving is there something going on there look for the underlying issue with families especially an argument is rarely about the surface level issue if a family member reacts very negatively to a seemingly trivial thing chances are there s some kind of old feud or resentment at play reflecting on your family s history can help you trace the roots of feuds and address the situation more effectively 4 x research source for example if your uncles are fighting because one of them made a passing joke about the other s job chances are there is more going on maybe one uncle always out shined the other growing up maybe they have always been very competitive with one another in this case the issue isn t just about personal tact when it comes to humor the issue is about insecurity knowing this will make it easier to address everyone s feelings when mediating the issue establish ground rules for the discussion when you get your family together to talk you need to establish some rules be sure to encourage the various parties to help in this process of creating rules that way you won t seem like you re lecturing or being condescending this will also help to assure the conversation runs smoothly and everyone can express themselves 5 x research source a good general ground rule is that only one person can talk at a time you can discourage others from interrupting you can start off by saying something like even if you disagree with what someone is saying it s important to let that person talk for the sake of this mediation you can respond when they re done you can also have general rules about managing emotion let everyone know that no matter how angry they get no one should raise their voice or use foul language encourage everyone to control their emotions it s not uncommon for tensions to run high when discussing family conflict there may be times when people get emotional and angry try to rein in the emotional outbursts as much as you can while everyone has a right to their personal feelings make it clear these feelings must be expressed in an appropriate productive fashion 6 x research source let someone know if they re getting out of control say something like uncle clark you re starting to raise your voice or uncle dave you shouldn t use words like that it s not productive remember not to try to shout over them when they raise their voice keep your tone gentle and your voice soft use brief prompts such as lets keep it down to keep them on track when they start to stray you can also ask if they d like to take a moment to breathe or compose themselves paraphrase people s thoughts it s important that everyone feels truly heard during a mediation after someone speaks briefly paraphrase their words give them a chance to clarify if you re misinterpreting something this way everyone will feel heard during a mediation 7 x research source for example uncle dave i m hearing you feel like clark was being condescending about your job you worked really hard for the promotion and while you don t mind joking around you felt like clark should have congratulated you first make sure everyone has a chance to express themselves do not end the conversation until everyone has expressed themselves go around the room and give everyone the chance to talk then go around the room again and let everyone respond before ending the conversation say something like does that cover it does anyone else have something they would like to share you never want to end a negotiation before all parties have vented their feelings and frustrations about a situation 8 x research source work on healing the relationships the solution you reach during a mediation is rarely cut and dry you may not have an exact specific game plan however everyone should leave with some idea of how to heal broken relationships 9 x research source it s not your job to offer exact courses of action however you can offer suggestions how family members could better treat one another in the future think about what has been said during mediation look for areas where change is needed remember to seek the input of others ask them specifically what they are willing to do to help improve the situation start with your own areas of change if appropriate suggest something that needs to be different in the future for example as a person s career is so vital to their sense of self maybe we should all use more sensitivity when joking about someone s job you should also agree to work actively on letting go of the feud for example for the next couple of months let s agree not to bring this up we don t have to talk about it over thanksgiving i think this will give everyone a chance to let some of this go and move forward strive for forgiveness you can start by forgiving the family members in question yourself even if you were not directly involved in the feud you were probably affected by the drama in some way choose forgiveness remember you can t control someone else s actions but you can control your own response 10 x research source you can also encourage other family members to forgive however remember you cannot force someone to feel a particular way keep your expectations realistic if a family argument or conflict has been going on for awhile you re not going to fix it overnight moving forward expect that things will continue to be strained if the family members in question are difficult and melodramatic by nature they may be unwilling to completely mend fences at the next holiday or get together accept there may still be tension despite your best efforts 11 x research source keep in mind that it might take several conversations before a situation is better give everyone involved a break but don t be afraid to revisit the issue down the line to see where areas of progress exist express pleasure about this and encourage everyone to keep trying,Family-Life

how to create family unity,in today s busy world many families struggle to see each other as much as in previous generations that does not mean that our need for family and unity has diminished however we are all still human and most of us crave a unified family to identify reminisce and spend time with that unity does not always come easily though you must communicate with each other help each other and spend time together to build the bonds and trust that must be present to have family unity,use effective communication skills each member of the family should feel important and valued this includes you in order for your family members to hear your needs you have to express them be polite but honest with your family during discussions for example if your family usually plans on watching a movie together on wednesday nights and you can t do it that night then you might say i know we said wednesday night would be movie night but i m so stressed out about this test tomorrow can we move it to another night this week listen intently just as you want your family members to hear you it is important that you hear their concerns your family members will feel loved and unified with the family if their point of view is heard and respected avoid talking over your family members and instead listen to what they are saying give your full attention to your family members when they are talking such as by putting away all distractions cellphone computer etc and looking them in the eye ask questions to show that you are interested such as what happened next how do you feel about that and what do you plan to do about it show you are paying attention by nodding and making neutral statements such as yes uh huh and i see show appreciation for each other taking family for granted is easily done most of them have been around most or even all of your life make it a point to tell each family member that you are thankful for them and that you enjoy being a family 1 x research source traditions such as going around the table at thanksgiving and saying what each person is thankful for are a good way to show this appreciation agree to disagree all members of your family are not going to agree on every issue as a family you have to be flexible and accepting of each person s point of view avoid arguing or bickering over trivial things such as who should take the trash out instead make a conscious effort to divide responsibilities and privileges fairly fairly does not necessarily mean equally when a conflict arises use good communication skills and empathy to solve the problem for example instead of shouting at each other allow everyone a chance to talk without being interrupted while each person is talking have the rest of the family listen closely and try to understand what the person is saying give and accept apologies when arguments do arise and they will you should work towards a resolution to the problem once the argument is over apologies may be in order if you have crossed any lines you should extend an apology to family members to help smooth things over the other important part of apologies is accepting them whenever a family member offers you an apology accept the apology and move on in order reunify the family remember to compromise to avoid arguments and resolve them also remember that perfect unity will not exist all the time in any family make family routines routines allow each member of the family to know when and where certain events will happen daily routines such as a 6 00 dinner time serve as touch points through the day to bring the family back together the key to setting routines is to keep them predictable if you must write it down for each member of the family you can also create longer running routines such as a weekly grass mowing or a monthly road trip assign each person chores for a family to be unified each person has to pull their own weight this means that you will have to assign tasks to each individual that everyone else can expect will be carried out each time the chores get done properly it re enforces trust and respect between family members you may choose to give each person permanent chores or rotate the chores every so often so that they are evenly dispersed with children and teens it can be helpful to rotate the chores this way everyone learns to cook to do laundry etc this eliminates any feelings of unevenness in the chore disbursement and teaches all children to be relatively self sufficient share other household responsibilities evenly some household responsibilities will come up that are not covered on the chore list when this happens they should be split between family members or different family members should rotate doing them this shows the kind of cooperation and respect that is vital for family unity once the responsibilities are finished the whole family can reap the benefits and enjoy your time together put the family first to have a sense of family unity your family member will all have to learn to prioritize the family this may mean making some sacrifices in other areas but the sacrifices may lead to a stronger family unit some things you can do include avoiding putting work before family plans don t cancel family outings and other family plans if you can help it this can be difficult especially if you have a demanding job but if you frequently cancel on your family to work late or pick up an extra shift then this can affect your family s sense of unity making your family aware that they are your main priority your family might not know how much they matter to you to ensure that they know try mentioning it for example you might start a conversation about values over dinner one night and say something like i think the thing that i value the most is my family limiting individual outings having too many things going on outside of your home may also interfere with your ability to form a strong family unit this means that you may have to be pickier about what sort of extracurricular activities or hobbies you and your family members engage in for example instead of having your kids do three or four different extracurriculars have them just pick one or two that they really like adopt family traditions family traditions create a sense of identity for the family as a whole they also give individuals something to look forward to these traditions should generate positive memories and facilitate enjoyable gatherings that bring the family together 2 x research source an example of a tradition is cooking an easter salmon every year at a family gathering you can also have weekly traditions such as taco tuesday family game night on thursdays or saturday morning walks take family adventures an

only day trips you can also go camping or hiking to create a memorable adventure to bring your family together gather regularly as a family the most important way to establish unity is to gather together whenever possible gathering as a family allows the time needed to have adventures traditions and conversations that will unify the family make gatherings pleasant by avoiding arguments and facilitating good conversations for example you could sit down to eat dinner and talk with your family on three or four nights of every week or you could plan on playing board games together once per week such as on a friday or saturday evening try to identify something that will fit into your regular routine and that will allow you to enjoy each other s company lean on each other every family experiences tough times whether it s a death in the family a job loss or some other hard time you should be comfortable leaning on your family members also be sure to let them lean on you when they

to leave early to take his dad to the clinic it made me remember that you haven t gone in a while state your concerns clearly and with love if your loved one isn t open to a casual suggestion you will need to approach the discussion head on be clear and direct about your concerns especially if their health is in a critical state you might say mom i can tell that your arthritis is getting worse you didn t even get out of bed yesterday i love you and i am worried i would feel so much better if you saw a doctor keep in mind that you may have to repeat this step several times before your loved one

approach 5 x research source for example you might say dad i was thinking we could schedule our checkups together this year i know that going with you will make me far less nervous than going on my own does that sound okay to you making it like they are going to support you rather than the other way around may remove the pressure also know your limits despite your best attempt your loved one is

pass the info along to the primary care physician use positive language sometimes the way you describe doctor s visits can make a world of difference in someone s stress levels speaking in worried tones and using negative language can make your loved one stress out about the visit rather than conveying anxiety try to send the message that seeing a doctor is an asset to their health 7 x research

how to heal family wounds,on the one hand addressing old rifts and frayed relationships in the family can be painful on the other hand letting past wounds go untreated means you risk losing valuable long enduring family bonds so rather than allowing them to fester and worsen learn how to repair the damage and come out of it even stronger than before while it may seem like confronting family members and addressing the issue outright is the most logical way to do this there are in fact other options you can choose such as writing a letter extending a direct apology or practicing more productive and open communication in the future,find a time to meet in person confronting past grievances in a face to face meeting can help bridge old rifts and improve communication if you have ongoing conflict and you re a tight knit family you might even want to arrange a standing weekly or biweekly family meeting where everyone gets together to talk this will help to keep everyone abreast of current issues and give everyone the opportunity to express themselves 1 x research source many families are dispersed across wide ranging geographical boundaries so getting together in person can be a somewhat rare occurrence it may be necessary to talk over the phone or video chat even if the next such occurrence is a few months away you can use the intervening time to organize your thoughts and plan your peaceful confrontation if the only time your family gets together is the holidays try not to use this as a time to work out your problems people put a lot of expectations of magic of the holidays and they can become more emotional and irrational when they feel that their holidays are ruined and become resentful of whomever they feel is responsible also it can make people start to dread the holidays as they come to associate them with stress and fighting reserve the holidays for savoring family time and find another time to talk about serious issues establish ground rules for the discussion since the conflicts you re addressing are deeply personal discussions can get heated quickly excessive emotion can derail the conversation and make it almost impossible to reach a productive resolution so you should try to keep things calm and controlled do this by establishing a general code of conduct which forbids certain destructive behaviors such as interrupting bringing up unrelated quarrels and name calling it can be helpful to enlist the input of the other party in formulating these rules so they don t feel like you are just parenting or lecturing them regulating the discussion can be easier if you have a disinterested party like a family friend or level headed relative to mediate your discussion if you have a big family but your lingering resentment involves just one or two other family members you ll probably want to carve out a special appointment or time when just the aggrieved parties and potentially a mediator can meet and talk this will avoid unnecessary interference from well meaning relatives express yourself with love you might assume that everyone in the family knows how much you love them but this isn t necessarily true in fact people often feel neglected when love isn t expressly articulated so you should make sure to say it often especially during an argument which addresses old wounds so when explaining your side of the story make sure to do so with explicit declarations of love and affection a good way to do this is bringing up positive memories and good times you ve shared throughout the discussion you ll be amazed how quickly these feel good throwbacks will get everyone smiling and feeling closer for example preface a statement about how you ve been hurt with i love you and the reason i m bringing this up is because our relationship is so valuable to me listen to each other you won t make any progress in your confrontation if you use the time when others are speaking to plan upcoming responses rather you should be listening to others feelings and words with an open and empathetic mind practice active listening by asking questions when you need clarification and repeating key points back to the person to ensure you understand this way you show you re attentive and genuinely concerned with understanding them 2 x research source you can also give small feedback gestures like nodding leaning in and light touches on the arm in order to make your interlocutor feel attended to you might say something like what i m hearing you say is is that right agree to move on perhaps the most important part of healing interpersonal conflict is coming to a mutual explicit consensus that you re all going to make an effort to move forward this agreement shifts the emphasis of old wounds to the future you re all acknowledging the hurtful past while also recognizing that this past cannot be changed the only things you can control are your actions and words going forward so say something at the conclusion like now that we ve talked about this let s agree to let this issue go and concentrate on improving our future behavior and relationship 3 x research source it can help to write out a list or contract of behaviors and words you both agree to avoid or follow in the future things like no passive aggressive texts everyone must extend invitations to all family events no petty exclusions and no venting to mutual friends or family members can help to remind everyone not to slip back into old habits and aggressions remember too that no one is perfect and it can be hard to change ingrained behaviors forgive people when they slip up stay in touch moving forward strive to speak or write to one another more frequently this small effort will keep lines of communication open and allow you to remind one another how much you care it will also boost your psychological well being and amplify your sense of satisfaction from unrelated aspects of life such as your career and friendships 4 x research source this communication can be a brief text every few days saying hi how are you or thinking of you you could also tag each other in social media pictures or memes such as a tbt photo on instagram or set up a ten minute weekly phone call it s important to emphasize taking an interest in the other person and asking about their life not just sharing your own information to show that you truly care about them reflect on your wrongdoing and resultant guilt if you have done something offensive or hurtful to your family the first steps to making amends are to recognize your blame in the conflict reflect on the reasons for your behavior and what impact it has had on everyone this thoughtful introspection will help to make your apology more meaningful and effective when you eventually deliver it to injured family members 5 x research source make sure that you analyze the underlying motivations behind your urge to apologize a genuine apology cannot be contingent on speedy forgiveness so if you re wanting to make amends simply in order to feel the relief of forgiveness you should reconsider whether or not you re truly ready to make a heartfelt apology apologize once you ve gathered your thoughts and feel ready to approach those you ve hurt extend a heartfelt apology to your loved ones you can do this through a letter or email or in person no matter what method you choose the most important thing is to be direct accept accountability without dodging blame or rationalizing and show you have thought about the impact of your actions 6 x trustworthy source harvard

do and i want you to know how regretful i am allow the other parties to explain how they were hurt by your behavior feeling heard is an important part of being able to forgive someone listening to the person without interrupting defending yourself or making excuses does a lot of the work for you emphasize your desire to make amends an apology seems somewhat hollow if it focuses solely on the past wrongdoing in order for your compunction to ring true you should also promise never to repeat the same offense in other words you re not just extending a flimsy retrospective excuse but vowing to work

was using these texts to friends as a way to vent about other things and frustrations in my life so i have started writing a journal or seeing a therapist in order to deal with my problems in more productive ways it can often be helpful to ask how can i make this up to you accept that forgiveness and healing take time of course you want your family to forgive you for what you ve done but you need to manage your expectations regarding this process acknowledge your family s right to take as much time as they need to think about your apology and that just because you ve apologized you re not owed forgiveness in the same way if you ve also been hurt by your family members and they ve apologized you should recognize your own right to take time before accepting and forgiving it s not a bad idea to include this lack of expectations in your apology this will show your family that you re respectful of their feelings and aren t putting pressure on them say something like no matter how you decide to respond to my apology i needed to express my sincere regret of course i want you to forgive me but i know that i have no right to expect this from you so take your time and know i m here to talk whenever you re ready seek help from a licensed professional if you re nursing a serious family wound such as childhood abuse or neglect you should deal with this injury as soon as possible otherwise if you keep suppressing it you ll find your ability to trust and love in other relationships and aspects of life will suffer for serious problems you should seek the help of a therapist to analyze and guide you through your feelings a licensed professional can also help you brainstorm ways to deal with the past and move on in the future 8 x research source if you have health insurance

area identify your goals for recovery when reflecting on the impact a betrayal or trauma has had on your life have your therapist help you identify your objectives for the process for example do you want to eventually forgive your family member and re forge former bonds or do you just want to find a way to get over the past so that it doesn t affect your life in the future since seriously abusive family members rarely apologize for the past your goals should not include receiving an apology or even recognition from the injurious person do things that make you feel good about yourself personal healing after painful family wounds is largely dependent on self esteem you ll only be able to acknowledge your pain and get over any associated shame if you believe you re a person worthy of respect

archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source you can strengthen existing friendships by making time for personal conversations trust building activities and attending one another s special events write a letter or make a phone call one of most important parts of the healing process is closure and a wonderful way to achieve closure is to write a letter and express unaired

send you can say all the things you ve always wanted without putting yourself in a vulnerable position and potentially re aggravating healing wounds forgive even if you intend to never see or speak to the offending family member again you might want to consider forgiving the family member for the sake of your own mental and emotional wellbeing this is because forgiveness can help you let go of the past and feel liberated moving forward 13 x research source you can ask your therapist for help creating a manageable productive plan for forgiveness that doesn t compromise your progress know when to end the relationship if there is an abusive family member it may be necessary to dissolve your relationship with that person as hard as it is to repair conflict within the family it is equally as hard

so enlist the help of a therapist to strategize how to do this you may wish to tell the other members of your family why you are ending this relationship an unfortunate truth is sometimes other family

family really is 15 x research source it can also help to remember that no matter how perfect other families may seem every family has its own problems focus on the present it s important to

everyone you re serious about this principle by establishing a common family rule to leave the past in the past and focus on positive behaviors and supportiveness in the present making new memories can be helpful in this regard if old traditions seem to belabor pain from the past try new experiences together as a family a good concrete way to stop belaboring the past is to avoid bringing up past resentments in current conflicts for example if you re arguing with a family member about a loan which hasn t been paid back to you in the agreed time frame stop yourself from using past money issues and unpaid loans into the present argument focus on steps for resolving the current issue and if the same thing happens again make a policy never to lend money to that family member again be vocal and positive about the progress you ve made while old family wounds can take time to heal you should remind one another how far you ve come and what positive steps you ve made this way you won t feel like the process has been futile and that you re just slipping back into old behaviors 17 x research source for example when a family member who always missed your concerts or basketball games in the past shows up to one send them a text afterward saying how much you appreciated their presence and support if you ve noticed a family member making an effort to use kinder words and tones in disagreements compliment them on their effort and express your appreciation demonstrate love while conflicts are unavoidable to some extent you can minimize their damage by spotlighting the love and deep bonds among one another you should do this in many ways don t just articulate your love verbally but also perform actions which demonstrate love for example give small presents such as hand picked flowers favorite candies or cookies and little seasonal knick knacks for no particular reason you can also show that you care by being of service in simple ways for example bring over morning coffee and bagels drop into your family member s workplace just to say hello make dinner for the family or offer to help with fixing a computer bug or installing a shelf for many people physical affection is the

demand area other websites offer similar services for cars so if they have a car they can spare part of the time they can rent it out to people who need it for a short period 18 x research source when renting out a space it s best to at least have a designated bedroom and preferably a designated bathroom for guests a small guest house is even better but any private area will go for more on these websites for houses try the sites airbnb or homeaway for cars try turo or getaround discuss a different living situation to help ease their financial burden most people want to stay in their homes as they age which is understandable however for some people that becomes unfeasible after retirement as they can t afford the place they live sit down with your parents and have an honest discussion about what other options might be more affordable and how you can help them get there 19 x research source for instance they may want to downsize to a smaller home or move to an apartment

mortgage a reverse mortgage is essentially a loan based on the equity of a person s house while these loans aren t ideal they can provide income for older couples who are strapped for cash 20 x research source ask if bankruptcy is an option for your parents no one wants to have that conversation with their parents but if you aren t in a place to help them and they can t support their debt it may be the best option talk to a bankruptcy lawyer first to see what the options are then present it to your parents 21 x research source you might say i know you two have been struggling with your debt and i wish i could help i m just not in a place financially to do so however i m wondering if maybe declaring bankruptcy would help i know it s a hard thing to think about it but it may make your life easier i m just worried about you and i want to help,Family-Life

on some of the younger kids first ask to talk with your cousin for a minute alone and ask them to stop if they don t stop find a supportive adult like a parent or grandparent that can help to discipline your cousin avoid having this occur in front of the family group use i statements to keep confrontations from feeling like personal attacks avoid blaming or focusing on the negative traits of the family member by using i statements you deflect the focus to how certain actions lead to certain reactions consider saying i was feeling hurt when you said that i m terrible at making breakfast then set the boundary by requesting what future behavior should look like in the future please keep hurtful comments to yourself or say something like i felt upset when you yelled at me about tying the trash bags without using the twist ties if you want me to do it differently that s fine but next time just ask me instead of yelling avoid saying things are generic in their negativity such as you re ocd or you re crazy focus your time on family members who are supportive while you may feel stressed anxious or upset by the behaviors of unbearable family members avoid dwelling on their negative behavior focus on what you can control your own actions take your mind off of unbearable relatives by reminding yourself of those who support you reach out to other family that you see less but have enjoyed being with make plans with them or talk with them over the phone do you have a kind grandparent talk with them or visit they may have wisdom about how to deal with difficult people lean on family that you trust about the difficulties you re facing with a challenging family member rally other family members together to handle the unbearable person if a family member is continuing to be obnoxious to you and others find an authority figure in the family you don t have to feel alone in dealing with an unbearable family member for example your brother may not listen to what s bothering you but he may listen to your mom dad or grandfather even if they don t live in the same city or state as you comforting relatives may be able to assist if there s a crisis or an ongoing challenge with your unbearable relative distance yourself find ways to limit your interactions with family members who make you feel upset or anxious this may be especially important if you see them daily or weekly learn to be polite when you want to distance yourself stirring drama may make other family members uneasy 5 x research source if the relative you want to avoid is a parent or sibling it may be more difficult to have distance if you re living with them find ways to create private space at home so that you don t feel bothered by them for example if it s your sister who s bothering you find a different room to be in when you re relaxing or doing work if the relative doesn t live with you but visits frequently find ways to be occupied with other things when they visit do something outside or with other people if they are at your home find spaces that make you feel more comfortable so the interactions are limited if the relative is someone you see only during the holidays this may be an uncomfortable time when you see them but remind yourself that you don t see them regularly you may be able to sit with other relatives more or excuse yourself when your relative is particularly unbearable if you re visiting at your relative s home find ways to excuse yourself from the room or interact with others at the house more if you re an adult it s your choice whether you want to stay and visit with someone who is rude and mean if you re told to visit as a child or teen talk with your parents or relatives about what makes you uncomfortable be open rather than keeping quiet and upset ensure the safety of children while each family may have different parenting styles it is important to protect your own children and those of others who may feel unsafe safety does not just mean physical safety but also emotional safety some unbearable family members lack insight about boundaries when around children they may use vulgar language or act inappropriate they may lash out at children because they have difficulties in their own lives here are some things to consider approach the person who is acting inappropriate and ask for them to stop for example let s say there is an aunt who uses vulgar language to talk about people she dislikes and her sex life she may not realize it s inappropriate to talk about that with six year olds in the room request to speak with your aunt in a different area of the room about her language if she continues to ignore your requests and she is in your home then consider asking her to leave unless she is able to act appropriately provide a safe environment if things are getting out of hand let s say you and your two children live with an unbearable relative who spends all his time drinking and acting obnoxious to others maybe he yells at you or the kids for seemingly the slightest things if you can t talk with this relative about his behavior you may need to find a way to have the relative live elsewhere or find another place for the children to stay safe don t let bullies and manipulators take over your life focus on staying safe 6 x research source be assertive don t let others blame things on you or use you as a scapegoat for a problem be polite and direct about the facts of the situation avoid immediately blaming them or being defensive it can sometimes be tough to be direct but if done in a clear and matter of fact way it may help you to feel less like a victim 7 x research source speak calmly and maintain eye contact be aware of the setting when having a direct conversation avoid asserting yourself in a large family gathering ask to speak with the relative in another room or privately focus on the topic at hand avoid bringing up the past or other things that are bothering you if the relative goes off on a tangent redirect them back to the original topic try to start and end the conversation with something neutral or positive avoid making the conversation too harsh say what you need to say and accept that the situation may not change after that be willing to let go of the topic if it s going nowhere set consequences for unbearable behavior if the family member is continually acting inappropriate and they are unavoidable find ways to establish consequences this will likely work if they are intruding in your space or your home don t be guilt tripped into accepting their bad behavior in the heat of an argument you may get emotionally charged when trying to address consequences for bad behavior try to only talk about consequences when you are calm don t threaten in a nasty way be clear calm and direct if you re younger than them or under 18 consider finding an adult or parent to help with setting consequences for example let s say you have two cousins who continually come over to your home and ask you and your family for money maybe you feel intimidated by your cousins they are loud domineering and guilt trip everyone talk with your family about what is going on and decide on the consequences of what will happen if they come over to ask for money get everyone on the same page that the cousins are not welcome if they continue to come over for money then you or another family member must explain to them that if they continue to ask for money after being told no then they will be asked to leave accept that you can t change other people s behavior while you may want to be able to fix someone or convince them that they re wrong this may feel like you re talking to a brick wall some people are willing and open to change while others are not ready or able to admit when there s something wrong 8 x research source while your family member s actions or words may cause you stress getting back at them or trying to tell them that they re wrong may not make things any easier while telling them no or explaining that they are not welcome due to their behavior may put you and your family member on non speaking terms sometimes having a little distance can help focus your time and energy on the people and family members who recognize their own faults are willing to admit them and see the importance of change accepting that someone won t change does not necessarily mean that you approve of their behavior you don t have to support them with your time money or talents if you feel that they are difficult or manipulative seek help outside your family while advice from family members may be helpful it can also be wise to seek support and advice from others who may have an outsider s perspective talk with friends or the family members of friends about what you re facing with your own family discuss with teachers or mentors the difficulties you re having seek out the support of school counselors or counseling centers in your community a therapist can assist with coping skills and teach you how to assert yourself if you re working see if your employer has an employee assistance program they may offer free over the phone or in person counseling sessions to deal with difficult people and relationships,Family-Life

with certain activities that you will do each year maybe for christmas you will make cookies together or for easter you could dye eggs this will give you a special time to look forward to and help ensure that you consistently connect ask your godchild for ideas about traditions they d like to have traditions don t have to be traditional maybe your godson loves cars and wants to go to watch a race each year for his birthday these traditions can be unique to the two of you and honor your godchild s distinct personality send cards and gifts not only does this show your godchild that you care but it is a great way to connect with them you can give religious gifts such as a special bible or religious jewelry you can also give general gifts for example a stuffed animal on their birthday make

or even text messaging make the most of the technology available to you to continue this special bond no matter where life takes you 12 x research source be a good example children need positive role models when your godchild sees the way you conduct yourself they will want to emulate it make sure your behavior is in line with your faith so that they can learn from not only your words but your actions 13 x research source you could volunteer somewhere together like working at a soup kitchen or building homes for those less fortunate when you show your godchild that caring about other people is important this will help them to learn empathy doing an activity together will also help your connection and let them see the ways that you care about people be a good listener be available to the child during any difficult periods such as a family illness divorce loss of a job or other unfortunate events let your godchild know that they can always confide in you when they are having a hard time or if they need a shoulder to cry on your support will be desperately needed at these times and you can provide guidance and encouragement to help them get through it step in as a caregiver in case of a terrible tragedy if you have agreed to be the legal guardian be prepared to step in for the parents give your godchild time and space to grieve while letting them know that you are always there for them help them to the best of your ability and don t underestimate how important your love and support is you will never replace their parents but you will play a vital role in helping them through this tragic time you don t have to help them through this alone sometimes a child will need counseling or outside support to cope with tragedy don t be afraid to ask for help if you need it recognize that everyone deals with grief differently your godchild will likely behave in a different manner than you are accustomed to this is to be expected and it is important to be patient and allow them time to heal,Family-Life

to drink a con might be them causing a fuss if you take back the invite review your list to help you decide if revoking the invitation is the best course of action keep in mind that you can t always take back the invitation in some cases not taking back the invitation will be the best course of action ask for advice choosing to uninvite a relative is a difficult decision one you shouldn t take lightly it may help to discuss the matter with a close friend or other relative whom you can trust reach out to this person and get their opinion you might say i m seriously considering uninviting rachel from the barbecue i heard about the fiasco she caused at the andersons gathering the other week and i don t want to have that kind of drama at my event what do you think 2 x research source decide if an alternative arrangement would work better before making the leap to fully uninviting the person determine if there are other ways you can manage their behavior while still allowing them to attend for instance if your relative has trouble controlling their behavior when drinking you might limit their access to alcohol or totally remove alcoholic beverages from the menu for all guests if two relatives are at war with one another you may be able to have both in attendance by separating them seat them far away from each other and assign a point person to make sure contact is restricted if you have a relative who tends to curse tell inappropriate jokes or start drama in some other way decide if they might agree to modify their behavior for the event for example you might tell them hi joel i know you have a trouble reeling in that potty mouth but there will be some conservative guests in attendance who aren t comfortable with curse words can you be mindful of your language if so then i would love for you to attend 3 x research source have the conversation face to face if possible if you arrive at the conclusion that the only way forward is to uninvite the person do so with tact the most courteous method to do this would be in person ask the individual to meet with you in private you might invite them out for lunch or coffee and have a chat say uncle tom how about you and i go out for coffee on tuesday i need to talk to you about something choosing a public venue might decrease the odds of your relative becoming irate or making a scene if your annoying relative lives out of town arrange a time to talk with them on the telephone avoid uninviting guests through email or social media even if it s hard do your best to approach the issue in a mature way which makes it more likely that you will be able to preserve your future relationship with this person 4 x research source be frank about your reasons prepare for the discussion beforehand review your pros and cons list develop a script to help you guide the conversation and rehearse it before the meeting when you have the conversation aim to be polite yet firm avoid vague language explain your rationale with brief and direct language you might say i m glad you chose to meet with me uncle tom this is hard for me to do but i know it s the right decision since you and dad are still on bad terms i think it s best if you don t attend the wedding my fiancé and i really want the event to be calm and low key and you two haven t even been able to stay in a room together without arguing lately i hope you understand 5 x research source chances are if this person has gotten into trouble for their behavior or have a history of inappropriate conduct they will probably understand your decision 6 x research source don t apologize saying i m sorry sends the message that you re wrong and makes it seem like you are taking ownership of their bad behavior if you are uninviting a relative because of their behavior don t feel bad you aren t responsible for other adults behavior but you are responsible for the satisfaction of your other guests at the event if you re worried that the person will ruin the affair don t blame yourself for uninviting them 7 x research source instead of saying i m sorry say something along the lines of i don t want to hurt your feelings this demonstrates that your choice is made with good intentions while still showing that you stand behind your decision stay calm if their reaction is negative there s a possibility that your loved one will react negatively to this situation being uninvited can be humiliating to them so try to be understanding don t take anything they say personally simply stay calm and offer your support you might say i can see that you re upset i didn t intend to hurt you but i believe this is the best choice explain that your guest list is limited in some cases a relative may have been unintentionally invited maybe you accidentally selected their name while setting up an event on facebook or maybe you talked about an event in their presence and they assumed they were invited whatever the case you might be able to make up an excuse for having to disinvite them say jessica i clicked your name by accident when setting up the page for samantha s baby shower it would have been nice for you to come but we have to keep the guest list under 15 people i m sorry that this happened apologize for someone who spoke on your behalf if an invitation was extended without your permission do apologize for the miscommunication you might say hey derrick ronnie told me that he mentioned the party to you last week he shouldn t have done that our guest list is very exclusive i m sorry for this mix up even better you might suggest that the person who made the mistake deal with the situation tell them i saw regina the other day and she s under the impression that she s invited to the party she tends to drink too much and i m worried that she will make a scene can you please uninvite her be firm with those who invite themselves some family members automatically assume they are allowed at any event hosted by their relatives maybe they never got a formal invitation but have plans to attend let them down gently for example you overhear your cousin talking about what she will wear to your bridal shower you might say oh candice i didn t realize you were planning to come the shower next weekend is going to be just for coworkers but i d love to get together with you some other time just the two of us 8 x research source anticipate having other guests boycott the event the worst outcome of uninviting one guest is to have other guests refuse to come out of solidarity depending on how important their presence is to you you may try to convince them to come however don t allow yourself to be coerced into having an annoying guest in attendance stand firm in your decision even if it means a few people not agreeing with you,Family-Life

how to talk with teens,teens are not always the easiest people in the world to understand or talk to they can be complex and moody with their minds fumbling between childhood and adulthood not to mention raging hormones but this doesn t mean its impossible to talk with teens,start a conversation at the dinner table create quality family time and encourage conversation during dinner 1 x research source ask everyone to turn off their cellphones or leave them in another room that way you can all focus your attention on the dinner conversation think of a few questions for everyone at the table to answer and avoid judging the replies focus on topics like the events of everyone s day future plans with friends or comments on the meal go for neutral topics that won t lead to a conflict or a fight try to get to know your teen as a person ask them about television shows they re watching right now or books they re reading share your own favorite shows or books another tactic at the dinner table you can try is to ask your teen about the highlight of their day it could be as simple as a good test score or a funny joke a friend told during lunch or it could relate to current news like the landing of the mars rover share your highlight with your teen as well listen to their highlight and don t interrupt them use time in the car for a conversation if you re spending a lot of time in the car with your teen as their designated chauffeur make the most of the driving time and use it to talk for some drivers talking in the car can be distracting so focus more on introducing topics of conversation and then listening to your teen s responses 2 x research source try to keep the conversation natural and open you could comment on your immediate surroundings did you see that guy make that left turn this traffic light is taking forever huh or you could focus on basic topics of conversation like your teens plans for the night or what time they need a ride home start a conversation during a commercial break watch the nightly news together and chat during the commercials if you re both into a show on netflix pause between episodes recap what just happened in the last scene or your thoughts on what will happen in the next episode 3 x research source this will give you and your teen something in common to discuss and will likely lead to natural banter between the two of you short bursts of communication are a good way to get a quiet teen to talk chat at night before bed some teens find it easier to talk at night knock on their door and ask if they have time for a talk sit with them in their room and ask them about their day before they go to bed 4 x research source another way to start a conversation at night is to greet your teen after a night out and offer them a snack this will show them that you are available for a chat about their night after time with their friends your teen may let their guard down and share more with you try a conversation starter like so how was your night or you looked so great when you went out how did it go or it was nice to meet your friend when she picked you up where did you guys end up tonight avoid interrogating your teen try not to act aggressive or ask them where they ve been all night long waiting up for them and pouncing on them as soon as they get through the door will likely only turn them off or make them less willing to talk offering them a snack or dessert when they get home will seem more casual and open try to talk about things that are of interest to your teen no matter what your teen s interests sports music fashion tv video games friends school work be open to talking about them work on being a good listener and try to show genuine interest in what your teen enjoys discussing 5 x research source a good rule of thumb is to listen twice as much as you speak this ensures you are giving your teen enough time and attention to talk about their interests 6 x research source 7 x research source be aware of your own reactions to your teen teens are great at doing or saying things that annoy their parents or elders rather than react emotionally to their actions or words consider why they be pushing your buttons the answer could be resentment towards being late for an important event or simply that they are being a moody teenager 8 x research source by reflecting on your responses to your teen you can find the root of the problem or issue this will likely also lead to less fighting and more talking admit when you are wrong and apologize this can be difficult to do as you may feel you need to serve as a good role model for your teen but acknowledging when you made a mistake will allow your teen to see you are human and someone they can relate to in fact admitting a wrong and apologizing sets a positive example for your teen i m sorry are powerful words for a teen to hear from their parents or authority figure 9 x research source this kind of positive communication will give your teen a chance to learn how to talk honestly and respectfully with others even when they disagree they will also learn to feel more confident when discussing their feelings with others including you offer your opinion but avoid lecturing or nagging your teen chances are you will hear your teen say something you disagree with but its important to avoid statements like that s a stupid decision or you re wrong about that boy instead try to offer an opinion by saying i understand where you re coming from but this is how i see it or i m here to listen but let me know if you want any advice from me start by noting your teen s feelings you seem upset about what happened last night using a statement rather than a question will make the phrase sound more like a suggestion rather than an accusation give them all your attention and listen to what they have to say put your phone away turn off the tv or shut the door make your teen feel like they have the floor offer help or advice once they have finished speaking ask them is there something i can do to help or would you like some advice often teens just need to talk about issues or problems to someone they trust and respect they may not be seeking the answer to a problem or an easy solution so be willing to listen to them rather than lecture them avoid yelling blaming and name calling these aggressive actions will likely kill any meaningful conversations with your teen remember you are trying to talk to your teen not shout them down or get upset at them respect your teen s privacy agree to private phone calls behind a closed door but set ground rules no calls after midnight or during dinner for example ask your teen where they will be when they go out at night but don t call them every five minutes to confirm show your teen you respect and trust them by not encroaching on their privacy this will likely make them more willing to share their thoughts or feelings with you 10 x research source it s important to respect your teen s privacy in small ways this could be knocking on their bedroom door before entering their room or asking for permission to come into the bathroom before you enter avoid barging in on your teen at different times of day schedule a time with them to talk about their latest test score or cleaning up their room don t catch your teen off guard as this may lead to a fight if you usually discuss these issues at dinner or in the car bring them up with your teen during your usual time give your teen some say in major decisions a move across the country or a major financial decision will affect your teen s world so rather than spring the decision on your teen consult with them about a major life change talking to them about the decision and listening to their opinion will show you respect their point of view it will also likely make the change less painful for your teen and help them to adapt to the change 11 x research source don t reveal to others what your teen has shared with you build trust between you and your teen by keeping your conversations confidential that is unless there is an issue you feel you need to discuss with your partner or another adult 12 x research source if you end up sharing your teen s private words this may shut down communication your teen may not want to risk offering their intimate thoughts or opinions to you again don t betray their trust by revealing what they told you in confidence,Family-Life

even though you might contribute financially it isn t the same situation as any other payment for shelter arrangement your parents are used to things being as they like them and it all rests on them having funded it in the first place treat it like a first come first served policy most of all be willing to share and be ready to compromise quickly on things that you know mean a lot to them and maintain their level of comfort and space always respect the wishes of your parents they re not your children they re not in a position of deference to your preferences if they want to watch a certain program on tv that you don t show your respect and walk away be proactive and set things up to have your own space to avoid bumping into theirs such as purchasing your own tv watching things online or visiting a friend s place for those must watch things that don t interest your parents accept that your choices will differ from what you wear to what they eat your choices will differ this doesn t imply that either of you is right or wrong each person is entitled to the way that they want to live their own life respect and value their choices as you do yours introduce your likes preferences and lifestyle to them in subtle ways never be afraid to be yourself but do it respectfully they may actually be more accepting of you once they know things better your likes may even become their preference over time just because you are an adult now doesn t mean the golden rule obey and respect your parents or something along those lines vanished in thin air oh no buddy that s a lifelong rule live with it and try to be happy while you re at it it helps ease unnecessary controversy listen to your parents expect to defer to and respond positively to their preferences when it involves the running of the household the decisions about home management and the way routines are followed while it is all too listen to reply and react it is important to listen to your parents when they talk and really hear what their perspective is you don t necessarily have to add something to what they are saying every time you talk this will avoid most of those conversations turning into arguments do not create or feed arguments if you know they disagree on a certain point you want to introduce to them just tell them to give your view a consideration and to focus on the positive side of your point this will work well if in a conversation or meeting with your parents give them the first priority to give their own views to make them easily adjustable towards what you really want them to take in however your success all may depend on the kind of parents you have if they they are always dictatorial you will sometimes be forced to disagree completely with them but if they are understanding you can always discuss the issues as they arise be self responsible take care of your own belongings do not expect your parents to be willing to fall into care mode and do your washing cleaning etc as when you were a child you are completely independent now and need to show this aspect at all times if you do allow some help with your things make sure it is part of an arrangement whereby you are helping them with something of equal value or effort do things for your parents help them out a great deal and show them that you can be responsible this will increase the happiness of the household greatly go that extra mile to take care of their needs regardless of what differences you may have parents may not say it often enough but even your smallest slightest gesture toward them makes them feel loved and fill the void created by generation gaps try cooking their favorite meal leaving a sweet note on the counter for them or doing a household chore that they typically take care of never forget to show your appreciation for having them allow you to live in their home keep a close check on your parent s health if they re elderly it is possible that the mood swings and temper of much older parents are an outcome of an underlying illness they may be irritable or angry due to an internal change or an underlying pain ask caring questions to elicit information about their health and help them with doctor s visits etc treasure your parents we all have to leave this earth one day we only have one life to live live it in the right way if you are lucky enough to have both parents realize that they are too special to take for granted someday when you grow old as they are at that point you will fully understand how short life truly is make today a day that you can look back at and smile from the memories you share with the ones you love even if you become annoyed by their many perhaps slightly infuriating habits remember they ve always been there for you and don t think for a second they haven t felt the same way at some point about your actions they too have had to endure your many perhaps slightly infuriating habits when you were a child or an adolescent or even as an adult patience is the key to a happy life count your blessings there are millions of people homeless because they don t have family and or friends to lean on when your parents begin to nag about something just be thankful for the gift of shelter and that cement wasn t your pillow last night if you treat your parents as a gift rather than a nuisance then you will enjoy the fruit of their hard work and unconditional love remember there were times when you were young and may have acted like a nuisance yet they always treated you like a blessing from above treating them the same way they did to you is the only way to repay their kindness just remember that you are lucky to have parents imagine what life would be like without them once they are gone from this earth they are still here in spirit but not physically present to be able to hug never feel bad about living with your parents they love you more than you could ever imagine if you have a problem tell them and come to an agreement don t go overboard as you are living in their house do not treat them as burden if you treat your parents as an additional responsibility then it is more likely that you will not be able to enjoy the process of being with them try to enjoy their association just as a kid which you used to do realize that now a role reversal has taken place your parents are now in your role as kid and you are going to take care of them as grown up implant happiness in this relationship celebrate birthday marriage anniversaries together with hugs and cuddle lighten up their lives let your kids play with your parents if you have children ensure that they spend time with their grannies and grandpas given this fast world when couples are sharing financial burdens together you need to ensure that somebody takes care of the children in the home who can give better security and take care for your children than your parents also when your kids see how you are taking care of your parents it is more likely that they are also going to take care of you in future examples are more than spoken words aren t they,Family-Life

with your own healthier versions as this will stop you from feeling like you re missing out for example if your family are eating a pepperoni pizza from your favorite take out you can try making your

muffin or making stewed apples with brown sugar and cinnamon you ll still get to satisfy your sweet tooth without breaking your healthy eating plan try to find foods that capture the taste and smell of tempting foods without the calories this will make it easier to watch others eat junk foods control your portion sizes if you don t want to go to the hassle of making an entirely different meal from the rest of the family you can still eat the same foods you just need to make an effort to control your portion sizes and make one or two healthy additions to balance out the meal for example if your family is eating spaghetti and meatballs you can still enjoy the meal without sacrificing your diet just take a small portion of spaghetti have a look at the package to see the recommended portion size then fill the rest of your plate with steamed veggies or if you re family are eating burgers from the grill try eating the burger without the bun white bread is basically empty carbohydrates with no real nutritional value and filling the rest of your plate with a healthy green salad you still get to enjoy the taste of barbecued red meat but it ll be guilt free try to find

daily run or dance class it doesn t have to be the whole family if you can just get your mother father daughter son brother or sister involved the rest of the family may follow try to find an exercise that you enjoy and do it for at least a half hour each day even if it s difficult at first you ll find it becomes gradually easier as your fitness increases don t make the excuse that you have no time for exercise everybody can find an extra 30 minutes in their day you just need to want it enough avoid stress being healthy isn t all about eating right and getting enough exercise it also involves taking care of your mental health by avoiding stress and making sure you get enough rest even if your family life tends to be a bit crazy and stressful it s important that you set aside some me time as part of your health plan some things you can do to de stress and relax include yoga meditation reading a book and or even taking a warm bath in the evening also make sure you are getting enough sleep you should be aiming for 8 hours per night 6 at the absolute minimum getting enough sleep ensures that the body is not overworked and that you are ready to perform well at work or school the next day if issues with your family or work are bringing you down consider seeing a counselor who can help you work through your problems and come to terms with any negative feelings you ve been having having a healthy body is no good if you re not in a healthy state of mind avoid getting sick in addition to taking care of your diet exercise and mental health requirements staying healthy within a big family also involves avoiding sickness when it hits your household luckily there are several measures you can take to avoid catching an illness from your family members hand washing is one of the most basic things that can help you to avoid becoming sick this includes washing hands before and after visiting the toilet before cooking before and after changing the baby s diaper and after touching any dirty tools or surfaces it s also important to wash and disinfect your hands after touching anything that has been touched by the family member who s sick it s a good idea to have hand sanitizer wipes or gel easily available for these situations in addition any toys that sick children have been playing with should be thoroughly cleaned to avoid passing the illness onto other kids in the family don t share any dishes cups or utensils with sick family members the dishes should be cleaned with soap and hot water after the sick person has used them this helps to prevent spread of germs from one person to another when one spouse is sick make an effort to to face in opposite directions while sleeping and avoid kissing one another bed sheets should be cleaned frequently in a hot cycle in the washing machine these precautions will help to avoid the transmission of some common ailments like the cold and flu get the whole family involved in the cooking process once you ve adopted your own fit and healthy lifestyle you can start slowly convincing your family to join you one great way to do this is to get the whole family involved in the cooking process get kids to help you with baking by doing simple tasks such as sifting the flour during home baking or beating the eggs for a healthy omelette ask family members what their specific likes and likes and dislikes are if dad doesn t like onions maybe you could leave them out of the next salad you make host a family pizza night everyone can roll out their own wholewheat pizza dough and load it with their favorite healthy toppings this is also a fun way for the family to spend time together present healthy foods in an attractive way when healthy food looks good it makes it a lot more tempting to eat so try to jazz up your healthy dishes by adding colorful fresh ingredients and interesting textures if you re trying to get kids to eat fruit a colorful fruit salad will look a lot more appealing than a few brown pieces of apple mixing in some fresh fruit juice or yogurt will also add flavor to the dish and make it more interesting if you re trying to convince adult members of the family to eat salad you may not have much luck with a boring combination of lettuce tomato and cucumber although these make a good base try adding things like strawberries or olives for color nuts and seeds for texture and eggs and avocados for flavor a tasty dressing made from olive oil balsamic vinegar and crushed garlic can also help to make a salad more attractive to picky eaters hide healthy foods in tasty dishes another sneakier way of introducing your family to healthy eating is to hide healthy foods in tasty dishes in this way your family can enjoy their mealtimes but still benefit from the vitamins and nutrients that healthy food provides on it s own spinach isn t a very attractive ingredient but if you try hiding it inside puff pastry with some garlic and low fat cheese your family will soon be fighting over it you could also try introducing items like lettuce carrots and bean sprouts inside homemade spring rolls be adventurous making vegetable soups is another great way to get your family eating more healthily without compromising on taste ingredients like carrots zucchini broccoli cauliflower sweet potato and squash all work fantastically well when blended into a soup and once you jazz them up with things like fresh herbs a drop of cream or a splash of soy sauce your family will forget about wanting processed foods use herbs and spices to make bland dishes more interesting herbs and spices are a godsend for any cook who is trying to make mealtimes more interesting for picky eaters by taking advantage of herbs and spices you can recreate the processed flavors that your family love in a much healthier more natural way popular spices include cumin turmeric cinnamon and nutmeg while common herbs include parsley thyme rosemary basil and mint experiment with adding different combinations of herbs and spices to meat and vegetable dishes and you ll open up a whole new world of flavor you can also play around with other flavor enhancers such as soy sauce fish sauce garlic and ginger flavored salts vegetable beef chicken and fish stocks and the zest of citrus fruits switch to healthier cooking methods healthy eating isn t just about what you eat it s also about how you cook it so even if you re having a tough time converting your family to salad you can easily convince them to make a couple of healthy changes to the way they prepare their food instead of frying meats or boiling vegetables switch to grilling steaming or baking in the oven these methods are much healthier as they don t require much fat for cooking like frying and don t boil away nutrients like boiling with a little seasoning the food will taste just as good but the number of calories it contains will decrease while the nutritional value will increase switch to using healthier unsaturated fats when cooking such as olive oil coconut oil and clarified butter and stay away from unhealthy vegetable and seed oils such as corn oil canola oil grapeseed oil and sunflower oil always cook with real butter instead of margarine or lard this simple switch can have a significant impact on your family s overall health introduce more variety to your meals variety is the spice of life as they say so avoid preparing the same kinds of healthy meals night after night or your family will soon get bored and slip back into their old ways for example you could try having an indian themed vegetable curry with brown rice one night a chicken and vegetable chinese stir fry another steak and green salad the next night and grilled salmon with asparagus and sweet potato fries the next just because you re eating healthy doesn t mean mealtimes have to be boring also try to take turns with the cooking another family member might come up with a fantastically delicious idea for a healthy meal which you would never have thought of involving other family members in the cooking process might also help to get them more motivated about eating healthy eat dinner together as a family sitting everybody down at the table and having dinner as a family will help to reinforce the idea that you are all getting healthy together it will also help to make your mealtimes more enjoyable as you can talk to one another about your day and just enjoy one another s company no matter how busy each of you are it s important that you make time for one another eating together will also help you to stay on track with your healthy eating plan as it s much more tempting to order take out when you re dining alone make sure everyone in the family has their own dinnertime duty so the work isn t left to one person someone can be responsible for cooking someone else can set and clear the table while someone else is in charge of the washing up you can rotate these duties on a nightly or weekly basis if you like organize fun physical activities for the entire family once you ve got the healthy eating down it s time to rope your family into doing some exercise if you have young kids in the family they shouldn t be too difficult to convince but older kids and busy parents might be a little more of a challenge think about organizing a family day trip at the weekend where you all go hiking or swimming or even for a long walk through the woods pack a healthy picnic and take this as an opportunity to spend some quality time together if you have a garden or backyard make an effort to get outside more throughout the week start a soccer tournament with your kids shoot some hoops with your sister or do some gardening with your mother any kind of physical activity is good,Family-Life

large expenditures private is just asking for trouble avoid taking on unnecessary debt keep each other on track by avoiding taking on debt for medium sized purchases like furniture or jewelry plan these purchases out beforehand with your spouse so that you can combine your resources and afford the full amount of the purchase this will save you money on interest payments in the long term in

how to support a family member with a disability,there are millions of people with some sort of disability as a result most people have either a friend or family member with a disability while disabilities are relatively common they come with a wide variety of challenges family members who wish to support their relatives may face a number of challenges ultimately with a little knowledge you ll be equipped to support your family member both physically and emotionally,pay attention to your family member s needs whether you live with the person you re helping or if you just visit them from time to time keep an eye on them to see if they need or want physical or emotional assistance after all if you don t know what s going on with your family member you won t be able to help them if the person lives with you watch them to see if they need help if you don t live with the person you should call or contact them regularly to see if they re okay and if they need help always make sure to respect your family member s privacy and personal space 1 x research source how closely they need to be monitored depends on their age needs and amount of care received from other people for example a young nonverbal autistic child will need more help than a fully verbal semi independent autistic adult provide need based assistance depending on the specific disability you can support your family member by offering assistance assistance can come in the form of physical help emotional support or short term long term planning tailor your help to the needs you observe or hear about for example if your relative uses a wheelchair and has good hand strength it would be appropriate to ask if they d like you to move a chair out of their way but it wouldn t be appropriate to offer to cut up their food if they say they can do it let them do it and don t insist on helping if offering emotional support think about spending time doing activities your relative enjoys respond to a request for help or support appropriately a very important part of providing help to a family member with a disability is the way you respond to requests for help from that person this is important because if you don t respond in an appropriate way that person won t feel comfortable asking for help or confiding in you if your relative asks for help with a specific activity try to help them as soon as you can try not to put it off so long that the person no longer needs your help always be polite and gracious when the person asks for assistance avoid saying things like i m sort of busy but i can help you don t want them to feel bad for having a disability instead just say sure what can i do make sure you are pleasant and seem enthusiastic when you are helping or talking to your relative ultimately if your relative feels like they are putting you out they won t want your support keep in mind that it may be difficult and take a lot for them to ask for help help your relative acquire any special equipment or resources they might need your relative might need disability related resources that they don t already have in this case you should do what you can to help them get the equipment or resources consider applying for grants for resources or equipment for your relative see if your relative is eligible for benefits under medicare medicaid their health insurance or other similar parties if your relative is a veteran they might be eligible for equipment or resources from the veterans administration help them navigate the bureaucracy of the va to get their benefits don t feel obligated to spend money you don t have 2 x research source demonstrate love and compassion ultimately one of the most important things you ll need to do when helping a family member with a disability is to show that you love and care about them without showing love and compassion your family member may feel uncomfortable or unhappy try to do little things from time to time that might go above and beyond just help or emotional support if you help a person who is immobile get food or go to the doctors perhaps think about bringing them to their favorite restaurant or bringing them takeout always accept them for who they are don t dismiss them and don t dislike them because of their disability try to view your relative as just another person with particular needs or challenges 3 x research source plan family events thoughtfully one of the best ways to support your disabled relative is to plan family events thoughtfully whenever you plan an event make sure to consider you relative s disability ultimately you want them to be able to participate in family events just like everyone else consult with your relative or their primary caregiver about what locations work the best or locations that the disabled relative enjoys visiting be thoughtful when planning the time of the event if your relative is best able to enjoy and participate in family activities in the morning or in the afternoon plan for that time of day if they have doctors appointments plan around those appointments pick activities that your family member can most participate if they are hard of hearing avoid noisy restaurants if they are immobile pick an activity that does not require much mobility research your family member s condition because there are so many types of disabilities you ll have to put a bit of effort into researching your family member s condition so you know what you need to do to help them while spending time learning about the disability might seem like work it will pay dividends in the future because you ll have a much better understanding of your relative s needs and the challenges that they face on a daily basis disabilities can be physical the main type of disability people think of when they think of people with disabilities are physical disabilities that restrict mobility disabilities can be emotional or psychological an increasing number of people are being diagnosed with emotional or psychological disabilities one common psychological disability is post traumatic stress disorder disabilities can be developmental many people also experience learning disabilities people with learning disabilities might require tutoring or extra help when it comes to making life choices or even choices on a daily basis cultivate your patience ultimately for many people who help relatives with disabilities patience is an important virtue patience is necessary when dealing with many types of disabilities this is important because some people with disabilities like everyone else might not always acknowledge how much your support means to them avoid thinking about time constraints when you are helping or supporting someone with a disability if you re feeling really frustrated chances are that the disabled person is frustrated too you might be dealing with this when you re with them but they have to handle it for their entire lives evaluate what sort of support you can offer while you may want to offer physical financial or emotional support the amount of help you can offer your relative may be limited this is why it is important to prepare to help your relative by evaluating what you can actually offer make sure to consider your financial limitations time constraints and other obligations like work or caring for young children if you can t offer time you may be able to offer financial help if you can t offer financial help you may be able to offer time if you can t offer either maybe you can simply check in on your relative from time to time and spend a few minutes on the phone with them ask your family member if they need support instead of offering unsolicited assistance you should ask your family member if they want physical or emotional support asking if they need and want you involved will enable you to provide help without being presumptuous and without your relative having to request help say something like if you ever need help you can count on me or if you ever need someone to talk to please call me offer both general and specific help sometimes people may be shy about asking for help or might not know where to start it can help to offer would you like me to guide you to the restroom or what if i came over at 6 00 with some gluten free lasagna asking your family member if they need support will allow you to initiate a conversation about their disability without you indirectly telling them that they need help listen to the person when communicating with a person about their disability the most important thing is to listen to them without listening you won t understand their challenges and concerns ultimately listening to the person you are helping will enable you to provide help that is truly needed and appreciated listening to a person and allowing them to give feedback will validate their personhood when listening to your family member avoid thinking about what you are going to say next try to truly clear your mind focus on listening wait until your relative is finished to respond allow them the full opportunity to talk coordinate with other family members another great way to support your disabled family member is to make sure that the rest of your family is on board with your plan in order to do this you should communicate with other family members and coordinate events and care to better support your disabled relative if you re not the primary caregiver make sure to stay in regular contact with the caregiver the primary caregiver is probably the person who knows the needs and challenges of the disabled person best next to the disabled person if your disabled family member requires substantial amount of financial support talk to your other family members about setting up a pool to share the cost of their expenses if your disabled family member needs emotional support and companionship talk to your family to make sure someone is always available to offer support 4 x

how to be a good listener to your family,communication is important for strong family relationships however if you don t truly listen to others it can be difficult to communicate working on your listening skills can help you communicate better and form stronger bonds make sure to listen actively show that you re listening with non verbal cues and ask clarifying questions when it s your turn to talk acknowledge what the speaker has said by reflecting and commenting on it avoid negative habits like interrupting to help conversations run smoothly,stay in the present when listening to a family member do not let your mind wander to other things it s important to strive to stay in the present to make your family member feel heard and valued 1 x research source avoid distractions when talking to a family member put your phone away and give them your full attention never think about other things when someone is talking instead focus only on what s being said if you feel your mind wandering return your thoughts to the speakers words focus on the speaker s words and not what you ll say next when talking to someone you often are focusing on what you re going to say next this tendency can can get more intense when talking to a family member if you re say discussing a family problem or disagreement you may be eager to share your thoughts however do not think about how you feel or wish to respond focus only on the speaker and their thoughts and opinions on the matter 2 x research source you can think of how you will respond later now pay attention to what is being said make understanding your family member s perspective your priority remember you will be better equipped to think of a thoughtful response if you actually understand what s being said communication will be better overall if you are able to truly understand the other person s point of view make sure that you really hear what they re saying you can even summarize what they ve said rather than adding your own thoughts right away you could say it s sounds like you re worried about your test results even though the doctor says everything will be okay show you re listening using non verbal cues you want the speaker to feel valued make sure to show you re listening you can convey you re paying attention via non verbal cues nod as the speaker talks smiles and laugh when appropriate and maintain eye contact 3 x research source make sure the speaker has finished talking before you talk it s okay to embrace a pause a couple of seconds of silence in a conversation is not a bad thing and allows the speaker a chance to fully express themselves instead of immediately launching into your response pause for a moment after the speaker finishes talking this will allow you to make sure they re completely finished talking 4 x research source people have a natural tendency to pause when they speak if you notice the speaker has paused do not assume they re done talking give them a few seconds before you respond if the speaker does not start talking again after a few seconds have passed it s safe to assume they ve finished talking ask questions for clarification part of listening is understanding if there s anything the speaker said you did not understand ask when someone finishes talking ask for clarification if necessary this will convey you are truly listening to your family member and value their perspective 5 x research source ask questions that encourage open discussion for example what do you think of the situation and where do you think we should go from here avoid asking why questions these can come off as judgmental and make the speaker feel defensive for example don t ask why did you decide to take that job instead ask how did you come to that decision restate what has been said briefly summarizing what the speaker has said can go a long way towards effective communication everyone wants to feel valued and heard so reiterating a family member s point can convey you were listening it can also give the family member in question a chance to hear your interpretation of your words and clarify as necessary 6 x research source try to briefly paraphrase what you heard when the speaker finishes for example so it sounds to me like you re a little frustrated with mom right now because you feel like she s not treating you like an adult this can help you make sure you understood the speaker it will really show you re listening and allow you and your family to communicate better help family members summarize their experiences you want to help someone figure what they re feeling and why after listening try to help your family member summarize their experience 7 x research source for example start with something like okay let me make sure i m clear on what you re saying then ask questions to help your family member frame their experience for example you re upset that mom gives unsolicited advice on your car insurance how would you say you feel about that i m sensing frustration helping a family member put a label on their feelings can help them better understand a situation reflect on what s been said after allowing a family member to talk reflect briefly on the subject try to figure out not just what s being said but why it matters for example say things like i feel like this is really important to you or i m getting a sense this is something we should all talk about as a family 8 x research source use i statements when it s your turn to talk family situations can be complicated you may sometimes disagree or take issue with what s being said when disagreements arise use i statements these minimize objective blame as they place the focus on your personal feelings over an objective assessment 9 x research source an i statement has three parts it begins with i feel after which you immediately state your feelings then you state what led to those feelings finally you explain why you feel the way you do if you disagree with a family member avoid framing your feelings in a judgmental manner for example mom is just trying to help and you know you ve had problems with money in the past you re really frustrating me instead reframe that sentiment using an i statement for example i feel frustrated because you re angry at mom when she s just trying to help because i think her concerns are legitimate and she does care about you accept you don t always have to solve someone s problems with family you re often inclined to help however you can t solve another person s problems oftentimes a family member just wants someone listen and empathize allow the person to talk and resist the urge to jump in and provide your two cents on the issue 10 x research source you could ask a reflexive question for example do you think it was possible that she was just concerned do not interrupt interrupting can put the breaks on effective conversation always allow a few seconds of silence after someone finishes talking before offering your response this allows you to make sure the speaker is done talking 11 x research source do not talk over someone either no matter how passionately you feel about a subject do not start talking until the other person has finished refrain from offering advice unless you are explicitly asked do not offer advice unsolicited advice can make it seem like you re not really listening you re only hearing what you want and offering advice in response if someone just wants to talk refrain from trying to tell them what to do 12 x research source do not change the subject prematurely never change the subject before the speaker has gotten their words out even if a subject makes you uncomfortable it s important you let the speaker express themselves 13 x research source if there s family drama you may be tempted to hurry the speaker for example if they talk about how you talked to your father last week you may start talking about something you saw on tv that night avoid doing this part of communicating with your family is talking about difficult subjects at times you need to allow conversations to flow where they will even if a topic upsets you avoid hurrying the speaker never rush the person talking do not interject with your interpretation before the speaker is finished just to hurry the speaker along never say things like can you get to the point this will make it seem like you re not invested in the conversation 14 x research source refrain from judgment even if you re frustrated or angry with someone try to cultivate empathy when listening try to understand how the person feels and why it s never a good idea to listen with judgment as this will reduce your ability to fully communicate even if you disagree with someone s actions or opinions avoid judgment 15 x research source it s helpful to hear the other person out as it will help you better understand where they re coming from,Family-Life

for your partner choosing to be kind gracious and polite shows you respect them which can make a world of difference in your relationship make it a point to be happy and encouraging around them even

feelings you might say to be honest i m a bit sad that we won t get to spend our anniversary together when you exhibit honesty your partner will feel obliged to do the same 4 x research source forgive when you love someone you have to be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt this may mean forgiving them and expecting them to do the right thing even after they have hurt you holding grudges

painful emotions that may be associated with the betrayal forgiveness comes easier when you employ empathy in your viewpoint of your partner take a step back and try to view the situation from your partner s point of view can you see some rationale behind their behavior maybe they were ashamed or scared to tell the truth doing this doesn t excuse the negative behavior but it does help you see your partner as human and capable of mistakes 5 x research source work on not continually bringing up the same issue even if it is still not corrected in the meantime continue to be kind and complimentary in other areas allow them to help themselves let your child complete tasks for themselves you show them you don t think they are capable of doing it themselves when you step in letting them accomplish things on their own shows you believe in and respect them choose age appropriate tasks for your children to complete on their own for instance picking out their own clothes dressing themselves and brushing their teeth are good options for younger children allow older children to make their own food complete job applications and drive themselves if they are capable 6 x research source validate their feelings and opinions children come up with and express a variety of different emotions you may not agree with some of them you should still show that you accept they have these feelings and thoughts and not shut them down tell them you understand what they are saying to you for instance you could say not being able to go to the movies when your friends are is upsetting isn t it i m sorry you are feeling this way here you re validating what they feel but you re not giving in to your decision you re showing them you respect what they say even if you don t agree with it model the behavior you want to see show your children the kind of respect you want them to show you they may not know or understand what showing respect looks like displaying it towards them and those around you demonstrates how you want them to behave for example speaking kindly and being polite is an excellent way to show respect not constantly criticizing them and giving compliments also shows that you respect them they will likely display this type of behavior after seeing you give it to them 7 x research source avoid speaking for them adults often talk over children s heads like they re not even there this can come off as disrespectful particularly when questions are being asked allow your child to answer their own questions and speak up during a conversation speaking for them shows that you don t trust that they know what they re talking about if someone asks you a question about your child say ask them they would know better than i do your child will likely feel proud that they are given the chance to answer for themselves it also shows that you believe they are capable of doing that 8 x research source correct behavior calmly and consistently kids need structure and discipline to understand appropriate behavior however yelling or having an outburst when they act up doesn t support positive behavioral traits to create a sense of respect and rule following make it your business to be compassionate yet consistent when correcting misconduct instead of lecturing or getting angry find a reasonable response to kids whining or complaining like that s the rule if you must validate their feelings with something like i know you were hoping to eat dinner in front of the tv to watch the show but we ll have dinner at the table like always that s the rule if your kids are attention seeking with bad behavior don t offer a reaction instead praise positive behaviors for instance if you see them sharing you might say oh that makes me so happy to see you two sharing your toys great manners 9 x research source keep things clean not keeping common areas and your own space clean is usually a big problem among roommates not only is it disrespectful but it shows your roommate you expect them to clean up after you this is often a huge cause of conflict among people who live together always clean up after yourself when you use the bathroom including toothpaste and hair in the sink additionally tidy up the kitchen after you cook and eat pick up any messes you make and vacuum and dust often showing respect in this way can make your living situation that much more pleasant 10 x research source designate a time for quiet having loud guests over late shows your roommate you don t care about their need for sleep avoid this issue by setting ground rules about this

you spending time with your friends but they are staying later than what we agreed on would you mind having them leave by the time we discussed you may need to renegotiate the conditions and your living situation if your roommate doesn t comply give them their privacy you likely don t want your roommate to barge into your room and use your things so don t do that to them ask before entering their space or before you borrow something invading your roommate s privacy is extremely disrespectful put a lock on your room if you don t trust your roommate although doing so shows your roommate that you don t trust them it s better than having your privacy invaded it also prevents you from having to confront your roommate about stealing which can make your living situation extremely awkward

raise with your natural parent some experts even advise that step siblings should have separate rooms if possible 12 x research source your parent might not think that sharing a room is a big deal explain what you are feeling openly and honestly like by saying dad i just feel like uncomfortable i don t know x very well yet and need my own space your parent and step parent might not have the money to get a bigger house in that case you might be able to find some kind of compromise if your step siblings only visit once in a while for example you can suggest getting a fold out couch for their stays 13 x research source talk about sharing sharing is a good thing but we sometimes need to have limits on what we re willing to share like your room you probably have clothes toys and belongings that are yours and that you don t necessarily want to share with a step sibling this is natural having boundaries on these things will help minimize problems with your new sibling 14 x research source you shouldn t be expected to share everything you own with step siblings or to make everything communal property if you re going to share a room talk to your natural parent and maybe your step parent about what can be communal and what you want to keep private for instance it would be hard to prevent your sibling from using a television or pc in a shared room but you could ask that he or she not use your telephone or ipod talk to your parent again if you feel that your step sibling is overstepping bounds for instance mom can you talk to x about borrowing my clothes i don t like it or dad x has been reading my diary and i want him to know that that s private ask for some time alone you and your step siblings also shouldn t have to spend all of your time together you both need space whether that means spending time with your own friends or having some private moments with your natural parent and siblings getting along will mean sometimes being apart your parents might ask you to include a step sibling in an outing with friends this is ok but speak up if you want some space every now and then dad i don t mind when x joins us sometimes but i also want time alone with my friends it s also important to have time alone with your natural family too see if you and your dad or mom can run errands together once or twice per week for example some step families even take separate vacations to get quality time together ask to be included in the process there s a good reason why people call step families blended homes it takes effort and compromise to meld together two families since you re a member of the household you might be able to have some say when your parents decide how things will run ask to be included in these discussions 15 x research source add your perspective when it comes to planning and rulemaking especially if you are a bit older you might also ask your biological parent if you can express your opinion like dad can i add my opinion too focus on compromising while your perspective matters it is also important to consider the perspectives of your step siblings and try to reach a compromise try to imagine what your step siblings needs are and how they might be feeling about the changes for example if your step siblings moved in with you and your parent then your step siblings might be feeling uncomfortable about their new surroundings or even missing their old home initiate family meetings see whether you can hold a whole family meeting to set new family rules and chores so that everyone knows his or her responsibilities and no one gets extra consideration chime in at family meetings and don t be shy to share your thoughts or opinions during the meetings you should communicate openly if you want to keep your old room say so and give your reasons why you may not get your way in the end but it s better that your family blending take in everyone s perspective you should also try to be respectful of your step siblings and be a good listener during the family meetings remember that you re trying to solve problems not to win an argument you will not get your way in everything a new family takes compromise accept your new normal you ll need a certain amount of acceptance in order to get along with your new step siblings things in your family are changing and won t be like they were in the past while you can t go back you do have some say over how well your new family gets along 16 x research source don t feel like you need to hit it off with your step siblings immediately but be open to forming relationships with them remind yourself that the family is your new normal this may take some time and even a bit of mourning that s ok and it can take months or more to start to feel natural try to participate in new family routines eat dinner with your step siblings participate in family games and activities and be open to relationships with your step family find support systems though you may try to accept your new normal and your new step siblings you may still struggle with this from time to time you should reach out to other family members and friends for support talk to a favorite aunt or uncle speak to a cousin or have a one on one with a close friend share your feelings and thoughts around having a new step sibling with your support systems so your emotions are not held in this will allow you to release any anxiety or stress you may be feeling about the new changes in your household and get some support from others keep your connection to your biological family strong while blending the focus is often on getting the two families to work together as a team but this shouldn t mean that your ties to your biological parent and siblings get ignored make sure that you are able to communicate with and remain close to your natural family members 17 x research source you should still be able to talk with your biological parent sometimes without having to share with your step parent or step siblings be clear when you need to do so for example mom can we have a one on one discussion for a sec i have something i want to say to you as said ask to do things alone from time to time with your natural parent and siblings,Family-Life

for it this won t bother your parent it shows them that you care get plenty of sleep eat well and spend time outdoors this shows your parents that they taught you well acknowledge your mistakes blaming other people is immature and parents can usually tell when you re doing it instead go to your parents and say it was my fault i messed up and i m sorry even if they re unhappy about your mistake they ll be proud of you for owning up to it but don t answer back they can surely get angry and would always point out your mistakes the next time so control yourself and stay calm even in the time of worst situations keep your promises if you offered to help do what you said you d do parents appreciate reliability and they ll trust you when it comes to the important things if you aren t sure whether you can do something don t promise to do it instead say i think i can or i ll try if for any reason you can t keep a promise say so right away explain what s going on apologize and talk with the person about what to do next focus on what you love about your family what makes your family special what do you love about each family member think about that appreciation and try to show it every day in one way or another be kind to your siblings play with your younger siblings and offer to keep them out of your parents hair when your parents are busy hang out with your older siblings and leave them alone if they say they re busy don t pick fights with your siblings and if your siblings pick fights with you don t retaliate ignore them and if they re in your way ask nicely for them to stop your parents won t blame you if they can see that you re trying hard to be a noncombatant show your parent s that you care express your gratitude through hugs and saying thank you when they do things for you do what they ask you to do without talking back and only contradict them if you feel that it s important avoid arguing with your family members if you re involved in a disagreement don t lose your cool stay sweet and genuinely listen to the other person understand what they re saying and try to work something out so everyone can be happy always voice your opinions respectfully for example if you do not feel responsible enough to do the dishes speak about it but offer to help in a different way for example you could say dad i don t think i m old enough to wash the dishes i m worried that i would drop them and i don t think i m strong enough to scrub everything away but if you want me to have more responsibilities maybe i could do a different chore like vacuuming write a letter if it is difficult for you to express your feelings if you feel yourself getting angry take a break instead of shouting or saying mean things it s okay to say i m really upset right now and i need to go cool off return to the argument once you feel calmer stay out of it if your siblings get in trouble you are not competing with them and it s not very angelic to be happy when something bad happens to your sibling give them some privacy or pretend not to hear if they are being scolded when it s over you could do something nice for your sibling like hugging them sharing a cookie or drawing them a picture to cheer them up this can help them feel better they might also want to be left alone which is okay do spontaneous favors for family members try offering to watch younger siblings giving gifts and crafts cleaning up or baking if you re old enough people will love the generosity practice kindness forgive people easily accept their quirks and cultivate good relationships your parents will love to see you being so kind forgiveness and kindness are the best forms of love don t worry too much about the way other people see you you can control your behavior but you can t control the way they think that s not your fault remember to relax have fun and enjoy your childhood,Family-Life

player game or give each one a specified time they can play during the day encourage them to talk about their feelings changes in routine can be stressful for kids validate their feelings and let them know that it s okay to be having a hard time here are some things you can say to an upset child i know you miss your friends they re a lot of fun aren t they maybe we could set up a video chat and

ask follow up questions if you are confused or need clarification once they ve told their side dismiss them to another room bring their sibling in and have them share their side of the story try to act as a mediator and help your children develop solutions to their disagreements for example you could sit down with them and allow each one a chance to talk and share their feelings then ask questions to help them come to a solution such as what is the main thing that you are upset about what do you think would make you feel better how do you think you could prevent this from happening in the future recognize each child s unique qualities it is important to see each of your children as a unique individual take time to tell each privately you re very special to me i love you and there is nobody else like you as kids get older and come into their own as individuals you should acknowledge their differences in your displays of affection for instance it s probably not necessary to buy both kids toy trucks if only one of them likes toy trucks instead think of their specific likes and dislikes if the other child likes planes buy one a plane and the other a truck be specific when praising your children instead of saying for instance you are a great kid say i think it s great that you re so creative and love writing music on the piano i m sure your talent will take you far if one child has a physical disability or emotional issue show extra sensitivity about it help the other child understand that their sibling needs a different level of care than they do but not because the child with the issue is better or loved more talk openly with your child about their sibling s condition and encourage your children to talk about the condition together don t compare your children if you tell one child that they are not as intelligent or as clever as the other their feelings will be hurt this kind of treatment could lead to long term resentment and emotional frustration it might also cause them to harbor anger towards the sibling who you said was better think carefully before ever criticizing your child 3 x research source instead of making comparisons

with your kids one of the great ways you can help strengthen your children s bond is by encouraging them to participate together in various holiday outings and annual events for instance supply your kids with a pumpkin and allow them when they reach an age where they are able to cut it into a jack o lantern with adult supervision during the winter build a snowman in the yard or provide them with the means to construct their own gingerbread houses 4 x trustworthy source understood nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences such as adhd or

magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source young children who play together will fight at some point too but unless their conflicts occur frequently at a rate of more than one conflict per five positive interactions don t encourage them to stay apart from each other if you know that your kids get cranky and are more likely to fight at certain times of day for instance in the late evening don t schedule joint playtime during those times give your kids time away from each other growing up especially in a small house kids might feel that they are overexposed to their siblings this feeling that their siblings are always around might make them feel trapped and frustrated leading to a deteriorating relationship it is just as important therefore to give your kids time away from each other as it is to provide time when they can be together 6 x trustworthy source understood nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences such as adhd or dyslexia go to source instead of taking both children everywhere with you or insisting that they play together when one or both don t really want to provide opportunities where they can be apart for a time for instance take one child to the zoo this weekend then take your other child to the baseball game next weekend that way you ll be able to spend an equal amount of time with each even though the time spent isn t always together while one child is spending time alone with you the other child could go on an outing with a friend help your kids overcome differences if there is a significant difference in your kids backgrounds find ways to help them bond that acknowledge and accommodate their differences for example if one child is 5 and the other is 15 it might seem hard to find ways for them to bond identify activities that they both like to do and facilitate opportunities to enjoy these activities together 7 x research source for instance if both children enjoy baseball allow the older child to take the younger one to a baseball game without relinquishing your responsibilities as a parent encourage your older child to watch out for their younger sibling in certain situations for instance if both children ride the same bus to school encourage the much older child to protect the younger one encourage helping behaviors if your siblings feel like they are in competition with each other then it may be difficult for them to be supportive of each other to improve their relationship with each other try to encourage helping behaviors among your children for example you might encourage your children to be supportive of each other during stressful times such as before a big game that one of your children will be playing in or before one of your children has a big test at school try saying something like don t forget to wish your sister good luck on her history test today she is really worried about it and it will mean a lot to her if you give her some words of encouragement or let s all cheer for danny when he comes out onto the field it will make him happy to know we are all here to support him express pleasure when your children are kind to their siblings when you praise your children for independently nurturing their relationship you help ensure they will continue to show kindness toward and understanding of each other for instance if one child shares a toy with the other say wow i really liked how you shared your toy truck with your sister 8 x research source you could also use moments of positive behavior to encourage even more good behavior by encouraging the child on the receiving end of the original positive action to thank their sibling expressing thanks helps people of all ages feel happier and your siblings will learn to associate that feeling of joy with their sibling of course it is okay to offer vague or general praise once in a while too remind your kids how well they usually get along after a conflict mention to your kids how surprised you are that they were fighting when just a short time ago they were getting on swimmingly reference a specific recent occasion when their relationship was good you might say for example you two were getting along so well when we were at the park what happened they will then remember the good time they had with each other at the park and cool down 9 x research source teach your kids to monitor their emotions since siblings often like to needle each other it s important to empower your kids to recognize and reflect on their own feelings they will then be better equipped to communicate in a healthy way with their siblings and with others about how they re being treated and why they don t appreciate their treatment 10 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source when your kids are frustrated by you their sibling or a friend help them identify their emotions for instance if your child is angry they can t go out to play ask directly how do you feel offer suggestions as to what they might be feeling for example you could ask i see that you re angry but are you also disappointed or sad let your kids know that all emotions are okay and that it is normal to feel angry when faced with a frustrating situation or person 11 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source expressing or recognizing emotions in others is the first step toward empathy getting your child to engage in these emotion sharing exercises therefore is useful for defusing frustrating situations they have with their siblings too encourage your child to always pose the question would you like it if i did that to you to a sibling

treated teach both your kids the importance of the golden rule treat others as you would like to be treated begin by sitting down with both of them and helping them write a list of friend qualities for instance you might verbally provide your kids with a list of words and ask them to identify and write each word that they want to see in a friend 12 x research source your word list might include kind funny mean sharing generous and selfish your children should understand that friendship and positive relationships require being kind generous and sharing with others ask your children to

others through roleplaying your children can discover what it s like to be on the receiving end of abuse roleplaying can equip your kids to identify alternatives to deepening a feud with their sibling 13 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source bring your children together for a roleplaying scenario in which someone is for instance name calling ask your child what they would do explain that the first step in dealing with a conflict is to slow down and take a deep breath help them understand that if they respond with aggression and anger the conflict will only get worse encourage them to instead locate an adult to help them resolve the situation roleplaying is especially effective after a conflict ensues once the dispute is settled you can bring your children back together go over the roleplaying scenario and end with a review of the roleplaying exercise to confirm your children understand the process ask them simple questions like next time your sibling is bothering you or treating you badly what should you do let your kids work things out as a parent of course it s natural to do everything you can to swiftly bring any conflict to an end and maintain peace in the house but if you allow your kids to manage their own relationship and take responsibility for their own actions they will become more active in building and managing their sibling relationship even if your kids are fighting fight the urge to jump unless they re engaged in really hateful speech or physical violence 14 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source this approach works best with older children adolescents and teens who should have conflict resolution skills that a younger child probably will not allowing your kids to work things out on their own also keeps you neutral and out of the conflict altogether you won t therefore get blamed later for taking one child s side over the other be patient learning social skills takes time some kids don t get along for years while they re growing up have faith that they will blossom into young people who appreciate and value each other s company continue doing all you can to support and improve their relationship 15 x research source if you re doing all you can to encourage a healthy relationship between your kids and they still don t get along very well don t blame yourself some people just rub each other the wrong way even if your kids are both from the same set of parents they may have very different personalities get help from a therapist if behavior problems between your siblings persist beyond normal levels of sibling rivalry and conflict serious ongoing conflict issues may suggest that one or both children have underlying issues that need to be dealt with before the sibling relationship can improve,Family-Life

hurt you it s hard not to take things personally but keep in mind it is likely not their intention to hurt you or embarrass you focus on positive things and less on the negatives if you do become upset excuse yourself and spend some time removed from the situation 8 x research source especially if the behavior is new and out of character for your relative do your best to say to yourself these words are hurtful but do not reflect how my relative feels about me talk about the behavior if your relative s words or behaviors make you upset or uncomfortable consider talking to them about it 9 x research source let them know that their words are inappropriate or unkind say when you speak to me like that it hurts my feelings please do not insult me or the work i do for you if talking gets you nowhere decrease the activities you do for them this can send the message of treat me nicely and with kindness and i will continue to graciously help you,Family-Life
how to maintain boundaries with family living nearby,maintaining boundaries with your extended family can be challenging especially when they live nearby while you likely want to take advantage of your proximity don t feel as though you are obligated to plan your life around your relatives in fact there are steps you can take when necessary to establish specific boundaries based on your personal needs there are even measures you can take to help you interact positively with particularly pushy relatives,don t feel obligated to attend every family event the best part about living close to family is that you re able to be a part of each other s lives this includes attending meaningful events such as birthday parties bar mitzvahs and soccer tournaments that said it s important to realize that you are not obligated to attend all of the events your family members invite you to 1 x research source you don t need a specific excuse either it s totally fine to say something like i m gonna head home and catch up on some rest tonight but i m looking forward to catching jimmy s match next week understand that you might receive some backlash or a guilt trip when you decline make your needs clear in a respectful manner and if pressed remind them that you don t need to justify yourself many people experience feelings of guilt when they consider turning down family events consider writing down your values such as self care or maintaining balance in my life and referring to this list when you begin to feel guilty family certainly is one of your values but reminding yourself of your other values may help help out when you re able to do so another benefit of living near people you love and trust is the assistance that you can offer one another even little things like stopping by a relative s after a snowstorm to help them clear the driveway can go a long way at the same time you are not obligated to do everything a family member asks of you 2 x research source in fact it s worth remembering that helping someone too much can prevent them from taking care of themselves to their full ability whatever your reason of course feel free to say something like i really can t swing by right now if you re still having trouble with your router this weekend i can maybe come check it out on saturday tell older family members when they are being too controlling sometimes your parents or your in laws may believe they know better than you about something while people often continue to learn from their parents throughout their lives there is also a point at which you are fully capable of making decisions on your own especially regarding social boundaries 3 x research source in short don t hesitate to reassure older relatives by saying something like i really do appreciate your desire to be involved in my life but i ve made up my mind it feels like you re trying to control my life and i do not need you to do so communicate what you are feeling ultimately the boundaries that will work for you must be determined based on your personal feelings stated otherwise the better you can communicate how you feel the more success you will have setting and maintaining boundaries 4 x research source consider examples of times that your emotional or mental limits have been pushed by family member s statements or behavior these are areas in which you might want to articulate more specific boundaries when something that you are not comfortable occurs voice your concern by saying something like i feel stressed when you stop by unannounced please respect our privacy by giving us a call before you come by articulate specific boundaries most of the time people who know one another are able to tell how they ought to behave in each others company however sometimes specific boundaries needs to be discussed clearly and directly 5 x research source for instance maybe you enjoy seeing a particular family member as often as possible but they often overstay their welcome in such a scenario state a specific boundary as a clear request say something like jared it s great that we re able to hang out a few times a week but it s important that i m able to get to bed by eleven every night i still want you to come over and spend time with us but we ll have to say our goodbyes a bit earlier in the evening moving forward insist that your wishes are respected some family members may resist boundaries perhaps even without realizing it for example you may ask a family member to respect a certain boundary they comply most of the time but still violate the boundary you requested from time to time in these cases it s important to reiterate your request 6 x research source don t allow yourself to feel guilty or doubt the validity of the boundary you want to see maintained repeat your request whenever necessary sticking to the boundaries you request will keep you from feeling like you re being taken advantage of or not begin listened to and will help your relationships with the relevant family members positive establish boundaries one step at a time establishing boundaries and maintaining them is a process especially in scenarios where there are a lot of things you want to see changed it s important to realize that other people s behavior won t change overnight 7 x research source if you feel uncomfortable about requesting a certain boundary you d like to see established make a different less stressful request first this can help the other person realize that they need to be aware of your feelings and desires for instance start by asking your cousin to stop parking in your driveway every time they come over as they keep blocking the sidewalk and upsetting your neighbors requests like this with specific simple reasons are a great way to practice establishing boundaries be firm and respectful if someone continues to violate the boundaries that you have asked them to respect it s important to stand up for yourself of course it s important to remain respectful in the interest of keeping the peace as much as possible 8 x research source for instance feel free to say things like i m always happy to see you david but we need some time to ourselves tonight i ll let you know the next time we re having guests over remove yourself from an escalating disagreement sometimes establishing and trying to maintain boundaries can lead to conflict between your values and those of one of your family members further you may both become invested in arguing about your perspective in part because you want an issue to be resolved however sometimes it is simply best to walk away and let tempers cool down this is especially important when a family member is hard to talk to about things like healthy boundaries it may take several conversations to get through to them remind yourself that other people s anger is not a reason to compromise on your values you may even want to say something like i understand that you re upset but i ve been very clear about how i feel about this and i m not going to change my mind simply because you re angry let s talk about it again when we re all a bit more calm reduce the amount of time you spend together if a boundary that you are serious about maintaining continues to be violated you may need to spend less time around the violating party for a while 9 x research source for instance if you ve spoken to someone about drinking less around your kids but they continue to over serve themselves you may need to ask them not to visit your home and or avoid visiting theirs though this may feel cruel it s more than fair to give someone the time and space to decide whether they are willing to adjust their behavior to respect a fair boundary that you request,Family-Life

how to introduce a child to a new boyfriend,introducing your child to a new partner is a decision that should not be taken lightly however if you feel that the time is right in your relationship to introduce your child to your new partner it is also very exciting because you now get to share the most important person in your life with somebody you care deeply for the following steps will give you some guidance on how to make the introductions easy on you your child and your partner,this first step is one that should be considered in all new relationships where a child is concerned make sure that you and your partner have a stable and happy relationship with potential for a future before making any introductions chopping and changing partners and introducing your child to every man you meet can be emotionally damaging and confusing to the child children are susceptible to forming bonds with people quickly and if the relationship is unstable and your partner leaves your child will also suffer the loss be sure of your relationship before making any decisions consider your child s age before you make any introductions there is no harm in a baby less than a year old meeting your new partner because if they leave the chances of your baby remembering or forming a bond is less likely than those bonds formed with an older child however limit the amount of time your new partner is around the baby if you are unsure of how the relationship is going to progress before you introduce the child to the new man in your life consider name dropping or voice calls mentioning your partner in conversation depending on your child s age will let the child know that you have a new friend who you spend time with also if your child has started talking already it might be a nice idea to allow them to speak on the phone occasionally so that your child will have some time to get used to this new person if only on a vocal level to begin with to make the introduction on the child easier keep the venue neutral and in an area where the child feels at ease and happy for example if your child is being uncooperative at mealtime bedtime or when you go to the store it s best not to invite your new partner over this is because again depending on the child s age they will associate the meeting of this new man with times they find distressing and may act up in the future when your new partner makes an appearance however if you go to the park or the play house the child will be at ease in a social environment where the meeting of people is somewhat the norm making the introduction something that s associated with fun when introducing the child to your partner it s probably best to introduce him as a friend at the beginning most children don t understand relationships between men and women particularly in the early years so there is no need to complicate matters by explaining if your child is older and does understand relations between men and women still consider calling him a friend while your child gets used to him being around to make the transition as easy as possible for your child try to keep things as simple as possible particularly in the beginning limit physical contact between you and your partner around the child and keep the nights he stays over to a minimum remember it has only been you and your child together for as long as he she remembers and the new partners involvement in both your lives can make the child feel insecure especially if they think that their time with mommy is being compromised help your partner bond with your child by telling him about what your child likes dislikes in advance that way he can strike the conversation to a great start with something that interests your child,Family-Life

peripheral mic connected to your computer or a recording app on your smartphone and follow the directions below position the mic as close to the storyteller as possible if you re participating and you only have one mic put it between you be sure to speak into the mic pick an indoor spot that s as quiet as possible background noises like airplanes and construction sounds get picked up by mics easily avoid places with lots of bare hard surfaces like empty rooms kitchens bathrooms and so on these places can give your recording a noticeable echo soft furniture rugs blankets and wall coverings can help for video recordings make sure you re getting a good image video recordings of family stories present their own challenges use these tips to ensure your recording looks as good as possible keep the storyteller s face and upper body centered in the frame you don t have to shoot head on slight angles are fine use a tripod or prop your camera on something sturdy to keep the frame still shoot somewhere with soft even lighting avoid harsh fluorescent lights and the outdoors consider putting a gentle light in front of the storyteller to completely eliminate shadows make a quick test recording nothing s worse than making an hour long recording only to discover that something didn t work to avoid this take 10 seconds to test your recording devices if the storyteller s voice is too loud move the mic away or reduce its recording volume if the storyteller s voice is too quiet move the mic closer or turn up its recording volume 1 x research source if you re picking up background noise move to a different spot or turn off whatever is making the noise if the storyteller s face has distracting shadows or is being lit too harshly in a video recording adjust your lighting or find a different spot get stories directly from the source if possible it s often best to get stories from the people who experienced them firsthand these people tend to have the most reputable version of events because none of their story has been affected by hearsay or secondhand accounts exceptions to this rule exist so use your own judgment only you know your family make your family member as comfortable as possible most family members will be willing to cooperate so you can get a good recording however children and the elderly can sometimes be hard to work with make the recording process as smooth as possible by ensuring everyone is comfortable before you start see below make sure the storyteller understands that s he is being recorded and consents to this offer the storyteller a rough time limit for the recording so s he knows when it will be over ask the storyteller if s he would like a drink or snack before you begin make sure the storyteller has a comfortable place to sit or stand offer a pillow or blanket if needed offer to take breaks if the story is a long one ask open ended questions to get personal responses it s perfectly acceptable to say something like tell us about the war grandpa to get the ball rolling to keep the interview going try asking lots of open ended questions rather than factual or descriptive ones these allow the storyteller to explore his or her thoughts and even come to illuminating new conclusions below are just a few example questions how did that make you feel what were you thinking at the time what was your relationship with this

least a few hours of storage space for short stories a smartphone will often suffice nearly all modern smartphones come with the ability to capture video however many lack the storage space and image quality for anything other than a few short clips if you lack access to technology take notes if all else fails you can always type or write down a family member s story as it is told this is the most

week where everyone comes together and shares some details about what s new with them or any challenges their facing then discuss any problems proactively as a family this helps your children feel comfortable bringing problems big or little to you when they encounter them practice active listening no matter how busy you are when your kids are talking don t tune out this sends the message that what they re saying doesn t matter listening requires being active in not just hearing the words but also understanding the thoughts and feelings behind the message 9 x research source use active listening principles when your children are talking such as making occasional eye contact demonstrating open body language e g uncrossed arms and legs and nodding or making appropriate facial

how to understand and maintain family cohesion,we can choose our friends and sometimes even our co workers but we cannot choose who our family members are we are stuck with them for better or for worse and we are bound together forever as individuals we each are unique in more ways than can be listed because of this family members don t always get along and disagreements can be expected nevertheless being family with someone does not need to be a constant nightmare,step back and think about the situations that cause conflict you might actually begin to appreciate the differences in others around you the variations that play upon the family dynamics as a whole take a closer look and you may even find hidden similarities you appreciate as well if you re not careful you could actually end up liking your family members even though they seem impossible to comprehend and drive you absolutely crazy coexistence with your family unit can actually become bearable perhaps even enjoyable despite the seething madness the exasperation the mayhem and inane antagonism it just takes a good deal of consideration and understanding kindness and courage and tact as well as patience patience patience and more patience understand that you can never get along with everyone all of the time because we are human each one of us is absolutely unique unto ourselves and completely different from everyone else we all have the right to exist as we are and we all have the right to our own feelings habits and personalities as we diversify naturally each member of a family has a special role to play for the purpose of the whole recognizing and respecting each person s right to their unique place in the family dynamic is the first big step to a peaceful co existence this also means accepting that some family members will not understand this concept nor will they respect other family members unique roles or their rights to exist in the home as individuals therefore we also must accept that they have the right to not understand or perhaps are lacking the capacity or merely the desire to understand and that they cannot or will not accept other individuals rights to deviate from their own understanding or lack thereof conflicts arise as humans diversify understanding and tolerance of others is only achieved from the acceptance of their right to exist as individuals respect for anybody is still a long way off so we are just going to have to make do with being polite for right now be patient even if others aren t unfortunately not everyone will hold such a virtue as patience impatience is unavoidable because as human beings we are all often rash cruel rude disgusting etc to varying degrees we are sensitive callous considerate tolerant inconsiderate petty profound at different times and in different situations the best thing we can do is to try to be aware of this be prepared for it and learn to avoid such moments when personalities will surely clash we must learn how to adapt to and overcome the conflicts of our obvious differences in order to remain functional in a family group only with patience and understanding can we achieve successful cooperation work on being friendly if you re nice to everyone first thing in the morning they ll be nice to you all day long taking a moment to say or do something pleasant and kind is greatly rewarding both for you and for the recipient instead of just going through routine motions try to greet your family members amiably with sincere warmth and affection no matter how small or insignificant a gesture may seem it still goes a long way to create a relaxed and cheerful atmosphere for all furthermore you can combine a good natured smile with a thoughtful compliment to instantly achieve a total sense of civil unity within the group a family greatly at ease is far less predisposed to inner controversy and battles to continue the comfortable alliance all around everyone will be wholly content to keep the peace realize that sometimes conflict will be unavoidable buttons will be pressed tempers will flare and arguments will undoubtedly happen one good thing about family however is that it is family no matter what they do to you or you do to them you re still all in it together there s no possible breaking up or permanent severance know that squabbling is a natural normal even healthy aspect of interacting families bickering keeps each role in a unit clearly defined our occasional quarrels are reminders of a basic primordial human need for a role in a small family unit on which we still depend today our conflicts arise from a lack of dependency on the cooperation of our family group for immediate gain without a dire need of one another we must recognize our developmental strengths and remember how to use them constructively for the good of everyone be tactful sometimes there is no escape from dealing with family members maybe there is a shared chore to accomplish or a coveted possession to be shared perhaps the holidays are coming and there is just nowhere to hide from one another sometimes a little diplomacy can go a long way to defuse annoying issues before they come up if you know where possible conflict could develop you can approach the family member and propose a solution that will make both your lives easier from the start discussing bargaining even subtle bribing could settle issues before there s even a problem also the relationship with that particular family member may possibly be greatly improved with the exercise of such successful cooperation you might even find that you are both smiling congenially as you collaborate for a common goal this kind of resolution puts you both back on the same team cooperation is the exact reason we evolved to exist in small family groups so it naturally leads to inner contentment fulfilling a primal directive if you can t beat em ignore em sometimes you finally just reach your wit s end and after blowing up at a person bending over backward or beating your head or someone else s against a wall you decide that you simply cannot endure the behavior or personality peeve or whatever of a family member any more you accept that even though you may have pleaded with them or discussed screamed or muttered under your breath bargained debated or even threatened over a conflict there is simply nothing that can be done to resolve the problem effectively in a case like this the best thing you can do is just concentrate on your own life and pay as little attention as possible to the annoyance factor by effectively tuning out the cause of such colossal irritation you can go about your own day with minimal disruption simply ignoring the family member can also save a great deal of energy and aggravation if you are able to resist such provocation completely you ll remain free of that sense of futility and frustration and maintain a sense of peace,Family-Life
how to deal with loved ones who refuse to change,when faced with a scenario in which someone you love is decidedly set in their ways you have a decision to make you can simply accept them as they are or you can act to improve your ability to communicate connect and grow with your loved one when a loved one is so unwilling to change that their behavior has a detrimental impact on those around them address the issue by taking healthy proactive steps that may convince them to change,focus on asking your loved one to change a behavior it is important to make sure that you are asking your loved one to change a behavior and not to change who he or she is try to identify the specific behavior that you would like your loved one to change rather than suggesting that your loved one change her personality some behaviors that your loved one might be able to change include criticizing nagging making inappropriate remarks such as racist sexist or homophobic comments yelling or screaming at you not respecting your privacy such as by invading your space or prying during conversations lead with a compliment people who are not willing to consider another s perspective or who are consistently engaging in behavior that is detrimental to themselves or your other family members are likely hard to talk to try to approach your loved one gently and start by offering a sincere compliment always begin your compliments with i rather than you for example you might compliment your loved one by saying something like i appreciate your help with the dishes or i have always admired how assertive you are or i think your passion for politics is so cool 1 x research source point to the problems with your loved one s behavior once you have gotten your loved one s attention and helped to disarm him or her with a compliment it may be easier to bring up the behavior that bothers you without causing your loved one to become defensive remember the goal is to focus on a behavior that you would like your loved one to change not changing your loved one for example you might say dad i feel uncomfortable when you make remarks about people who are gay i have good friends who are gay and they are not at all how you describe them i feel hurt and confused when you say those things offer encouragement it is possible that your loved one will become defensive when someone is blatantly refusing to change or reconsider an opinion he may be out of his comfort zone if this happens try to encourage your loved one to approach the situation differently 2 x research source for example you might say something like i know this is not a comfortable topic for you but i think it is awesome that you are willing to talk to me about it make yourself available to your loved one take care never to avoid your loved one even when he or she may be frustrating you 3 x research source unless you or others are in danger because of the other person s behavior don t avoid your loved one isolating your loved one may intensify his or her problematic tendencies so continue to include your loved one in activities as you usually do make sure your loved one knows he or she can come to you with problems try saying something like i want you to know that i m here for you when you want to talk avoid pressuring your loved one to change change takes time and pressuring your loved one will not make it happen any faster try to avoid doing things that might cause your loved one s negative behavior to continue such as 4 x research source constantly bringing up the issue after you have made your loved one aware of your feelings he or she will need to think about what you have said and make a decision to change or not change the behavior continuing to bring up the issue on a regular basis will not speed the process or sway your loved one it is more likely to upset your loved one than anything else avoid passive aggressive comments about a loved one s behavior making passive aggressive comments is another form of pressuring your loved one so it is best to avoid these for example don t say things like too bad some people are so close minded stand up for yourself if your loved one s behaviors are hurting you then you need to stand up for yourself this can be difficult especially if you are used to keeping quiet when you have an opinion 5 x research source however you will need to start being more assertive to help your loved one see that his or her behavior is not okay try saying something like i respect your opinions but i have a right to my opinion as well the things you are saying doing are hurting me and i want the behaviors to stop articulate your willingness to have a conversation free of blame state that you have no desire to attack a loved one emphasize an interest in listening and responding to one another non defensively 6 x research source if something comes up but tempers are running high or the context is not appropriate for an open heartfelt conversation ask your loved one to agree to talk soon state the intention of a conversation beforehand for instance say something like i want to strengthen our relationship by better understanding ______ open a conversation about your loved one with a story about yourself particularly if you re hoping to discuss your loved one s unwillingness to change or willingness to see something differently talk about a time you came to an awakening of your own 7 x research source talk about a time you accepted help for something you had previously insisted wasn t an issue check your terminology and framing to ensure you are not shaming your loved on for whatever it is you believe he or she needs to change quit trying to reason abandon the concept of who s right and who s wrong if someone refuses to change either a behavior or perspective on a single issue he or she may not be relying on reason or logic to make this decision 8 x research source the behavior may just be part of your loved one s belief system so debating will not help avoid starting a debate with your loved one don t ask your loved one to provide proof for his or her beliefs or try to prove your loved one wrong ask questions try to better understand where your loved one is coming from for example you might ask something like what experiences did you have that have caused you to feel that way use i statements when conveying your opinions making it clear that you recognize that your own perspectives are often subjective or opinionated may help loved one s come to the same conclusion 9 x research source begin sentences with i think ______ in my opinion_____ or it seems to me that _____ if a statement requires elaboration follow with something like so i m wondering about _____ or it seems that this might lead to _______ elaborations are only necessary when your loved one doesn t respond to your initial observations or stated feelings demonstrate the way you hope a conversation will go send clear signals that you are willing to revisit and rethink your positions and that you hope your loved one will have the same attitude 10 x research source if you state opinion as truth and your loved one jumps on you for it admit that your terminology was problematic and adjust it say something like well yes you re right i can t be positive but i see it like this laugh off brief moments of tension it is extremely normal for moments of tension to arise in everyday conversation especially between loved ones who spend a lot of time together if this does occur quickly try to reduce the tension 11 x research source say something like jeez we re both being pretty stubborn all it takes for someone s defenses to go up is one side refusing to give ground make sure it isn t you that pushes a conversation into deadlock follow up any potential spots of conversational lock up with a question such as do you see it differently be patient you may end up feeling most frustrated just when your loved one is closest to adjusting their behavior when they ve acknowledged that things need to change but may still be slipping 12 x research source recognize that even when people are willing change takes time breaking entrenched patterns of behavior in particular is a process incremental improvements even only during dialogue are worth acknowledging show your appreciation for a loved one s effort and willingness to change by thanking your loved one for talking with you know when to end a conversation sometimes it may be the most healthy or safe decision to change the subject or simply walk away if your loved one is absolutely unwilling to have a mature conversation and becomes aggressive or starts to shout then don t risk your own stability and safety 13 x research source end the conversation before it gets out of hand for example you could say something like let s talk some other time when we are both feeling calm or this has been a good start but i think we should end it here get informed whatever has brought the issue of your loved one s unwillingness to change to your attention may require more than conversation to address properly look into how to help your loved one deal with any of the issues you think your loved one may be having in their individual lives 14 x research source part of being there is having something to say when someone comes to you for help or when they don t know the first step that a loved will need to take so you can recommend it talk to a health care professional you may benefit both in terms of knowledge about your loved one s scenario and in terms of your own mental health by seeing a mental health professional yourself ask your loved one to consider professional help if you re able to have an honest conversation with a loved one who is struggling with personal issues you ll likely have an opportunity to help try to find some information about where your loved one can go for help the best way to do this may be advising your loved one to see a general practitioner and ask for a referral to a therapist 15 x research source your loved one may be more likely to agree to seeing a general practitioner than to seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist general practitioners may then be able to convince your loved one to see a mental health care professional when advising your loved one to get help emphasize statements your loved one has made or behavior that may bring harm to your loved one or to others for example you might say i am concerned about what you said about feeling angry all of the time i think that you might need to talk to someone about that to feel better if you don t know where to look for help or information contact organizations such as the national alliance on mental illness 16 x trustworthy source national alliance on mental illness grassroots mental health focused organization providing resources support and education for those affected by mental illness go to source ask your loved one to get help for you if your loved one resists your recommendation to see a professional or otherwise get help you might consider asking him or her to do so for the sake of your relationship 17 x research source ask other friends and loved ones to do the same in dangerous scenarios in which your loved one s behavior is detrimentally affecting his or her own and others health and safety this may be the only way to convince your loved one to address the need to change try something like i know you re struggling with ______ right now and i want to let you know i support you i want our relationship to stay healthy and positive and it would mean a lot to me if you got help dealing with _____ know when to end a relationship set boundaries for relationships in which there is risk to yourself or others including your loved one take the time to reflect on what you are willing to participate in help with or frankly put up with in your life 18 x research source articulate the boundaries you set for yourself to your loved one for example you might say something like i can t be around you when you have been drinking if i come home and you are drunk then i will have to leave if a loved one consistently knowingly defies or asks you to defy boundaries you ve clearly articulated you need to consider ending the relationship if a loved one is consistently hurting you or others you need to act ideally

child will adjust to their new family circumstances and hopefully grow to love the new additions,be open with your children about what is happening nothing beats resolving potential difficulties ahead of time therefore it s a good idea to be open and honest with your children from the outset and make them aware of any possible changes in family structure the more information they have the more prepared they will be present the idea of having new relatives to your kids this will help you to gauge their responses and how they feel about the possibility of having a step father step mother or step siblings later on create an open dialogue with your children initiate open and regular communication with your kids this will enable them to open up to you about any concerns or reservations they might have keep certain things in mind when telling your children about your plans usually there is no ideal time to tell them about your plans to re marry you just need to do it as gently as possible when the time feels right just make sure to remember the following factors surprise announcements won t work you have to break it to your kids slowly and gently to make sure that you have the ample time to talk and listen to each other s opinions make sure that your kids and your partner have already met prior to your engagement they re likely to digest the news much more easily if it s someone they ve met a one on one discussion or spending a day with your kids is probably the best approach when it comes to telling them about your plans you can take them out for dinner or spend a day out of town this allows you to have quality time alone with your children where you can explain the situation set up a time for your biological children and step children to spend some quality time together allow your kids to spend some time with their future step parent and step brothers and step sisters this is an important part of the process of getting to know each other blending two families together is not an easy task it is important to find the right time to introduce your kinds to the future members of your family as soon as you inform your kids about your plan to re marry or before this if possible you may start planning their first meeting remember first impressions last so be sure that the timing is perfect for everyone pick a fun place where they can bond and get to know one another you can choose to take them to their favorite amusement park for a perfect day of bonding together let your future partner and your own kids spend some time alone together allow them some bonding time to get to know each other s personalities eventually your kids will find some common ground with their future step parent be prepared to experience some bumps along the way when you and your children move in with the new additions to your family expect them to need some time to adjust to the situation common issues kids in this kind of situation may experience include the feeling of being isolated or left out the feeling of being replaced the feeling of being restricted and given ultimatums lacking trust or respect for the new family members the feeling of being pressured to accept these huge changes before they are ready make yourself available to listen to your child s concerns the blending of a family is an emotional time for children take a moment and put yourself in the child s shoes are they mourning the loss of a deceased parent or grieving after a difficult divorce listen to each child s fears and concerns and make their emotions a central part of your new family bonding plan don t expect each child to adjust or accept the change at the same time and don t push them to love their new life right away but rather let them adjust and heal at their own pace recognize that your child is going through a major change and that they might react differently to it accept that and slowly motivate them to become integrated into their new step family try to avoid rushing your children to become close with their step family give each of your children biological and step enough time to adjust to each other s personalities each person has different ways in coping with changes in the family so give them room and allow the situation to sink in respect their feelings and show them that they are important loved and appreciated changes should be made gradually don t force or expect them to accept any changes instantly that may just put extra strain on your relationship spend quality time with your biological children to reaffirm your own relationship a common fear of children joining a step family is that their biological parent will love their new stepchildren more than them take time to maintain a strong connection with your biological children and do things with them one on one make them feel special and loved by taking the time to listen to them or to do a special activity that they love if your child loves art take time to go to an art class together or take a trip to the arcade if your child loves video games you may feel the need to establish strong relationships with your new stepchildren but don t forget about the kids you already have be patient a new stepfamily doesn t become a perfectly blended family overnight there will definitely be ups and downs for everyone during the adjustment process practice patience and keep trying to bring the family together in natural ways don t pressure your children to be best friends with the members of their new step family but do encourage respect and teamwork among family members not every family is perfect and trying to corral everyone into thinking they are instantly one big happy family can cause major resentment from the children take things slow and find natural ways to bond with each member of the new family consider trying to find some common ground encourage relationships within the step family but don t push anything before children are ready try to find similarities between members of the family and encourage them to explore those interests together for example if you have a biological daughter and a stepdaughter who both love soccer take the entire step family to a soccer game that the girls will enjoy and that will hopefully foster a new relationship between them new step siblings naturally feel some competition with each other so don t push instant friendships pay attention to each child individually and point out their similarities and opportunities for friendship set up a time for your biological children to spend some one on one time with your new spouse allow time for your child to spend one on one with your new spouse some children have a difficult time adjusting to a new parent and may not know how to best handle the situation others may worry that they are betraying their biological parent by bonding with their new stepparent allow the relationship between child and stepparent to grow at its own pace but encourage both sides to communicate and spend time together at whatever pace they need if your child is comfortable encourage them to go on an outing or do an activity individually with their new stepparent this can be as simple as a walk to the park or a trip to get ice cream but can allow a new relationship to grow and for both parties to become more comfortable with each other keep your child s biological parent in the picture if possible children adjust better if both biological parents are involved this isn t always possible but when it is make a conscious effort to involve both parents allow your child s other parent to come to major events like recitals and graduation and let them have regular one on one time make sure your child knows that their new stepparent isn t there to replace their biological parent but to be another person you loves them if you are sharing custody with the other parent try to have regular check ins where you share information and updates about the child so that everyone is on the same page hold regular family meetings listen to each member of the family and make sure each child s voice is heard holding regularly family meetings creates an open environment to discuss progress and problems and to work through issues as a team make sure the opinion and feelings of every child are heard so that no one feels overlooked or invisible which can easily happen in a blended family encourage open and free communication and work to create a calming and supportive environment where children feel free to discuss their feelings work together to create rules for the whole family as a family create a list of family rules and display them in a prominent place discussing the rules as a new family helps everyone s voice be heard and gives each child a buy in to follow the rules children from different backgrounds and upbringings may have different ideas of rules so do your best to mediate the situation and find a compromise without playing favorites create roles for each parent create a safe environment for your new family and have roles for each stepparent be aware that your biological child may react differently to guidance and discipline from their new stepparent at the beginning it may be helpful to maintain control as the main disciplinarian to your own child instead of risking your child alienating their stepparent it can be helpful for the stepparent to fill the role of friend or counselor at least at first in order to build a strong relationship with your child spend quality time with the whole family use your already established routines to bond with everyone examples of fun bonding activities include spending friday movie night together cooking weekend breakfasts having family dinner together monthly hiking or biking trips going on your annual summer vacations together create new traditions together creating opportunities for all members of the blended family to participate in an activity together will help each child feel welcomed and accepted many new blended families go on a vacation together to celebrate their new life this can be beneficial to some families but the key is to establish routines and rituals in everyday life not just in vacation mode find a tradition or activity that works for your family such as weekly game or sports nights eating a special food each week or a monthly trip to the zoo and follow through getting the input of each child when deciding the activity can also help with a smooth transition regular family activities give children something to look forward to and help them feel that they are part of something bigger it also creates a fun environment for the family to connect on a more casual level try to incorporate your biological child s traditions when it comes to holidays and existing traditions you may have with your biological child don t throw them away or disregard them now that you have a new family children crave consistency and having a tradition from their old life can be a comforting reminder of how things were while also strengthening your bond with your child if you and your child have always baked sugar cookies together around christmas make

them to dress up as different characters and play a variety of roles 19 x research source for instance your child might start acting out scenes from a favorite book or tv show or come up with stories using their dolls or toys they re also more likely to plan and talk about their play scenarios at this point e g i m going to pretend my kitties are having a birthday party your child may also develop a more advanced level of abstract or symbolic thinking at this stage for example they might pretend a block is an animal or a cardboard box is a treasure chest try cooperative play with your child by

how to stop cloth diapers from leaking,if you re feeling frustrated because your child s diaper won t stop leaking and you re not sure why don t worry there are some easy ways to find out what might be the problem so you can fix it it s a good idea to pay attention to when your child s diaper is leaking like when they re sleeping or when they play on the floor so you can use this information to solve the problem with a little bit of time your child s diapers will hopefully be leak free,add more padding to the diaper to absorb more moisture your child s diaper might be leaking because there isn t enough absorbency to catch everything add some additional layers of padding to the diaper in the spots where the leaking seems to take place and see if this helps 1 x research source if you notice the diaper leaks often when your child is sleeping look to see how they re sleeping on their stomach side or back and add extra padding in that area check that the diaper isn t too big around the leg area this is a common reason that cloth diapers leak if there are gaps around your child s legs when they re wearing their diaper it s going to be easy for fluids to leak out make sure the diaper fits snugly around their legs so nothing can get out 2 x research source if the diaper is too big put it aside until your child grows into it the diaper will also be situated higher up on your child s waist when it s properly fitted change your child s diaper more often to see if it reduces leaks it might be that there s too much liquid in the diaper for too long try changing the cloth diaper every 2 3 hours and see if this stops the leaking 3 x research source cloth diapers are known for being less absorbent than disposable ones so you ll need to change them more frequently test out a diaper insert made from a different material if you re currently using microfiber or cotton inserts in the diaper you might try out a bamboo or hemp one instead each material is a little different but they re all known for being pretty absorbent 4 x research source microfiber inserts often lead to more compression leaks which happen when your child is putting extra pressure on their diaper but they re still super absorbent cotton is a great inexpensive insert option bamboo is very absorbent but more expensive and hemp can soak up a lot of liquid but does it more slowly purchase a new cover for the cloth diaper if the old one has worn out the cover that goes over cloth diapers is usually waterproof which helps to stop any leaks if your cover has been used a lot it might be worn out and in need of replacing check whether liquids still repel off of it by pouring a couple water droplets onto it to see if they slide off 5 x research source if you don t have a cover for the cloth diaper it s definitely a good idea to invest in one this will help prevent the leaks check the cover for any small holes from being washed frequently which are another sign that it s time for a new cover try out a different brand to see if it works better for your child sometimes the leaks might just be due to the type of cloth diaper or inserts you re using shop around and try out a new brand to see if these stop the leaks 6 x research source check to see if the diaper has a repelling issue over time oils from soap or diaper creams can cause the diaper to stop absorbing things and instead repel them to test this drop a few drops of water on the diaper and watch to see if they absorb into the material quickly or roll around on the surface 7 x research source soap scum often causes repelling scrub the diaper with a degreaser to help remove soap and creams use a toothbrush to rub a degreaser or dish soap into the diaper scrub the diaper gently with a little bit of water to help create suds and rinse the diaper several times to be sure the soap is out this will get rid of any soap buildup or greasy cream residue that was left in the diaper 8 x research source put the cloth diaper through a regular wash cycle after you ve spot treated it with a degreaser use laundry detergents made specifically for cloth diapers purchase a detergent designed for cloth diapers so that they re less likely to cause soap buildup this will help prevent repelling and make your cloth diapers last longer look for a detergent for cloth diapers at your local grocery or big box store 9 x research source strip the diapers to get rid of mineral buildup and clean them thoroughly stripping cloth diapers is important because it will prevent repelling and mineral buildup that comes from using hard water to wash the diapers fill a container with hot water and add a stripping agent to it before adding the cloth diapers some people like to add bleach to the mixture too to help with disinfecting 10 x research source stripping agents will be labeled as laundry treatment for cloth diapers or something similar and they can be found at big box stores or online rinse the diapers thoroughly after you strip them so that there aren t any soapy bubbles anymore it s not necessary to strip your cloth diapers after each use but stripping them every now and then will help make sure

proceed with the ceremony even if you feel like you re doing the right thing to help slow the spread of covid 19 it s natural to feel upset disappointed and even overwhelmed by the decision remember your wedding is supposed to be all about love so try to roll with the changes and be patient with yourself as you navigate the process,monitor local guidelines on group gatherings while you re contemplating what to do about your wedding stay informed by listening to your local state and national authorities as well as medical experts like the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and world health organization who many social distancing guidelines are expected to extend through much of the summer if not longer but it s important to be aware that the situation is constantly changing as people learn more about coronavirus and the impact it s having on the world 1 x research source for instance you may hear a news update that changes the guidelines on how many people can gather which would affect how many guests you could have at your wedding if you decided to proceed with a smaller ceremony if you re planning a destination wedding pay special attention to news about travel advisories and restrictions for instance you might follow news outlets or local government officials from your chosen destination to keep informed about any local quarantines postpone your event if you re okay with some uncertainty unfortunately there s no way to know exactly when it will be safe again to celebrate a wedding with a large group of family and friends if you choose to postpone your wedding right now there s a chance you ll need to amend your plans again so just prepare to be flexible 2 x research source for instance if you reschedule for the fall but social distancing guidelines are still in place or have been reinstated you may need to change the date again or have a smaller ceremony as a bonus you may find that your vendors are more willing to waive fees if you re postponing rather than canceling the event cancel your event if you re not sure when to reschedule for if you d prefer to wait until you can be 100 certain that it s safe to have the wedding of your dreams it might be best to cancel for now then once the coronavirus outbreak has been contained and or we have a vaccine you can choose a new date and start the planning process again 3 x research source this can be a hard decision but try to keep in mind that canceling your wedding doesn t necessarily mean you re no longer going to get married it just means that you re no longer moving forward with the ceremony as you d originally planned hold an intimate ceremony if you don t want to wait if you and your partner are ready to get married now and you don t mind having a modified ceremony go ahead and tie the knot just make sure whatever you plan falls in line with the most current social distancing guidelines for your state for instance you might have a small gathering of 10 people or fewer in your home or backyard as long as you stay a safe distance apart you can even have a larger celebration once the outbreak is over if you d like 4 x research source try streaming the ceremony on a video chat platform to get more of your family and friends involved you could also elope while it might not be safe to travel to marry right now you could get married at your local courthouse then have a more formal ceremony once it s safe to gather again let your guests know of any changes in plans as soon as possible as soon as you decide to cancel or postpone your wedding reach out to your family and friends to let them know for instance you might use your wedding website social media or email to post a heartfelt update explaining your decision 5 x research source try saying something like with heavy hearts we have decided to temporarily cancel our wedding ceremony although we are still very excited about beginning our marriage we value the health of our family and friends more we hope you understand and we look forward to celebrating with you all once it is safe if you d prefer to talk to your guests personally try splitting up the list between yourself your partner and perhaps 1 2 members of your wedding party then call each person individually and let them know what s happening be sure to reach out over the phone to any guests who might not be internet savvy since you don t want to leave them wondering make a spreadsheet to keep track of any fees you owe your vendors unfortunately if you reschedule or cancel your wedding you could still have to pay your vendors up to 5 15 of your original contract price this will vary from vendor to vendor though so speak to each one individually to determine what you ll be responsible for try making a spreadsheet so you can easily track all of the fees you owe as well as which ones you ve already paid 6 x research source vendors may be more likely to charge you fees if you cancel your wedding than if you postpone it for instance you might include your wedding coordinator vendor caterer florist baker dj or band and any rental companies you re working with ask your wedding coordinator for help navigating the process if you decide you need to cancel or postpone your wedding contact your wedding planner immediately however don t cut ties with them right away you may find that your coordinator is able to help you work with your vendors to avoid fees especially if they already have relationships with some of the business owners in your area 7 x research source your wedding planner may also be able to help you get refunds for any guests who have to cancel travel plans check any vendor contracts to see if they include a force majeure clause some contracts include a provision that excuses both parties from their obligations if events outside of either party s control make it impossible to fulfill their agreement carefully read the contract you signed with each vendor to see if this type of provision was included depending on the language in the clause this may potentially cover cancellations due to covid 19 8 x research source if you have any questions about your contracts it s a good idea to consult with an attorney review your wedding insurance policy if you purchased one wedding insurance is designed to help protect you from owing cancellation fees in the event that your wedding doesn t take place if you bought a policy read over it carefully to determine whether it covers an interruption due to a pandemic like covid 19 9 x research source unfortunately some policies may not cover cancellations due to a pandemic so be sure to confirm this with your insurance company 10 x research source work with your vendors to choose a new date if you reschedule if you re planning to postpone your wedding talk to your vendors to find out what days they have available keep in mind that competition for available time slots may make it hard to get exactly the date you want so try to be flexible for instance if you decide to reschedule for the fall or winter you ll be scheduling around any other weddings that were originally scheduled for that time as well as other couples who ve had to delay their weddings due to coronavirus 11 x research source you may have the best chance of finding a free day if you schedule for a year from your original date you might also consider having your wedding on a weekday when there s typically less demand on vendors approach your vendors in a compassionate and personal way while it s natural and normal that you might be feeling stressed out and upset about delaying your wedding it s important to remember that your vendors might be feeling the same way in fact many small business owners are facing concerns that their business will close so try to approach them in an empathetic way talk to them like you re talking to a real person and if you need to ask them for any concessions do so as politely as possible 12 x research source for instance you might send an email saying something like hi beth i m writing to let you know that we will not be needing the three tier white cake that we had planned for may 25 2020 as we re canceling the ceremony due to the coronavirus outbreak i m so sorry for any inconvenience i ve read over the contract and i understand that the deposit we already put down isn t refundable but would it be possible to transfer that if we reschedule our wedding for next summer we re still looking forward to working with you when things are back to normal hope you re staying safe and healthy chris in addition to just being the right thing to do showing your compassionate side may make the vendor more likely to work with you as you negotiate cancellation or rescheduling fees check with the airlines if you had travel plans if you were planning a destination wedding had out of town guests or were planning to fly to your honeymoon call the airline and let them know you need to cancel all flights currently most airlines have waived the normal fees they charge for canceling or changing flights so it s best to reach out to them sooner than later in case that policy changes 13 x research source if your guests had hotel rooms booked they may be able to receive refunds for their canceled stay as well remember that postponing your wedding is best for everyone it s understandable that you may be feeling sad about having to delay or cancel your wedding but try to remember that this can be an important way to help keep your dearest friends and family safe avoiding large gatherings is one of the biggest ways to help prevent the spread of coronavirus so take comfort in knowing that this difficult decision is in the best interest of your loved ones 14 x research source if a friend or family member criticizes your decision try saying something like i m disappointed about it too but we really feel like this is the best safest decision we can make right now i hope you ll still be there whenever it s healthy for us to celebrate together acknowledge your feelings if you re disappointed or sad even if you feel like you re making the right decision you might still feel upset stressed or sad in addition you have to factor in any feelings you might already be struggling with due to the coronavirus outbreak like loneliness due to social distancing if you notice yourself feeling that way gently remind yourself that your feelings are valid and normal and allow yourself to experience them as they arise 15 x research source make sure you have a healthy outlet to deal with your emotions and let them out bottling things up makes it much worse for instance if you feel really sad take a few minutes to cry write in a journal or talk to someone you love let your partner know you re there for them chances are you re partner is feeling the same way as you right now so try to support them emotionally turn to each other for comfort don t be afraid to express your emotions and encourage them to do the same 16 x research source use this as an opportunity to break down what really matters to you for your wedding for instance you might both find that what you really want is to just elope or you might decide that you still really want a wedding with your family and friends whenever it s safe to meet again find a way to honor the day anyway even if you reschedule or cancel the celebration try to do something to acknowledge what would have been your wedding day that way you ll still be creating a special memory and it can help you and your partner feel closer together even if you have to wait to get married for example you could plan a romantic candlelit meal you could order your favorite takeout and watch a movie together or you might video chat with the members of your wedding party 17 x research source,Family-Life

washcloth is the water warm enough you can also make tactful suggestions during the bathing process such as here s the soap for washing your body or i m going to hand you the shampoo next so you can wash your hair 7 x research source ask suggestive questions to arrange a washing time instead of asking whether or not they want to bathe pose your questions in a way that assumes they want to avoid yes or no questions such as do you want to bathe or not in addition to coming off as testy this omits the assumption that more bathing should be done for example you can ask when should i come back to help you with your bath or what time of the day suits you best for showering arrange for help with washing depending on your relationship with the person they may feel awkward about your helping them with such a private routine if the person is living with a spouse or partner first suggest that the spouse or partner help them bathe if the pair seem open to this begin by discussing and establishing a routine with both of them mark the washing days at least two per week on the calendar schedule a caregiver if the person can t bathe alone and is uncomfortable with a family member helping out hiring a caregiver for home visits is the best option these services are widely available in most communities search your directory or the internet for in home health provider or home health care 8 x research source schedule a bathing session for at least twice a week marking it on a calendar that is easily visible attached to the refrigerator hanging on a wall in the kitchen the idea of an unfamiliar person helping them to wash could be worrisome assure them that the caregiver is a professional and is specifically trained to help people take care of themselves regardless of who helps with washing remind the loved one that bathing can be a pleasant refreshing experience and is important to staying healthy set a regular washing schedule whether it s you a spouse or a caregiver who will be helping putting washing times on the calendar will help the loved one to improve their memory and get a better sense of the week s activities when you or the caregiver arrives it s bath time an event as expected and routine as dinnertime or bedtime 9 x research source check in to make sure that washing is taking place as planned if you re not the one helping with washing either ask the spouse or partner whether the schedule is being followed or call the in home agency to make sure the treatment is running smoothly if the person is washing themselves an easy way to make sure they re using the bath regularly is to check the soap bar size and body wash shampoo bottle levels to see whether they ve been used since you ve already completed the difficult task of asking them about hygiene it should be easier at this point to casually ask whether they ve been keeping to the new bathing schedule you d agreed on consult a doctor if you meet resistance it s possible that your loved one will refuse to bathe despite repeated attempts on your part to explain the benefits and to offer to help in this case consult a family doctor and ask about medications that are designed to ease resistance to care install grab bars as needed these can be very reassuring and helpful for a person who has already fallen or is afraid of falling in the bathtub they should be readily available at a pharmacy or bath supply store install a tub bench shower chair if the person can t sit down in the tub these are especially useful if there has already been a fall or if there is apprehension about falling because of frailty or fatigue 10 x research source pharmacies or bath supply stores are again the best places to shop for these add a non slip mat or apply anti slip tape to the base of the tub many bathtubs may already have this sandpaper textured tape affixed to the bottom of the tub but it could help to add more in the middle area where most of the standing is done when showering non slip mats for drying off are available for the floor just outside the tub as well install a handheld shower head this will give the person more control while washing it is also much safer since it prevents falls by 1 eliminating the need to maneuver under the shower head to wash hard to reach areas and 2 allowing them to sit in a shower chair while washing 11 x research source ensure the proper functioning of the water system test the water temperature by hand let both the hot and cold water run for a few minutes each to check for major temperature fluctuations if the temperature changes from hot to cold frequently contact the landlord or hire a plumber to resolve the problem if the person lives in an apartment it s best to do the test in the early morning when other residents will be showering and fluctuations would be most common check the water heater s temperature gauge and make sure it is set to 120 degrees this should help prevent scalding temperatures 12 x research

how to deal with a cranky senior citizen,maybe you are dealing with an irritable elderly neighbor or perhaps an older family member seems to be regularly out of sorts whatever your individual situation dealing with a cranky senior citizen can be very difficult fortunately there are several steps you can take to improve the situation and make both of your lives easier remember just because you might communicate differently the senior citizen still has feelings too,assess the situation when dealing with an irritable elderly person your first step is to try to figure out what the problem is is it evident what is bothering them for example do they seem to be struggling to get groceries inside the house during nasty weather if so that s probably why they re cranky 1 x research source if you can t tell at a glance what the problem is try to dig a little deeper if your neighbor or relative seems cranky for no discernible reason try to use communication to figure out what might be the problem consider external factors keep in mind that elderly people are often dealing with an extra set of attributes that can affect their mood for instance as people age their bodies are changing it is entirely possible that the elderly person in question is dealing with physical pain that you don t know about that could certainly affect their mood 2 x research source many older citizens are on several different types of medication often different prescriptions can have negative affects on a person s mood be aware that your elderly friend might be crabby because of medication not because of an immediate issue ask questions when trying to figure out why a person is irritable the most straight forward and effective way is to ask questions you don t have to pry but you can try asking a series of open ended questions by opening up a conversation you might be able to ascertain the cause of irritability 3 x research source for example instead of just saying how are you use a more open ended version such as how s your day going what s on your agenda for the day using open ended questions will not only provide you with more information but will allow your relative to vent some frustrations make sure to speak clearly some older people suffer from hearing loss they might not necessarily be cranky maybe they just didn t hear you when you said hello listen carefully when you initiate a conversation with an elderly person make sure that you are being an active listener focus all of your attention of the conversation make the older person feel like you really value what they are saying 4 x research source there are several ways you can demonstrate that you are fully engaged in the conversation make sure to make eye contact also paraphrase what the elderly person is saying and ask questions throughout the conversation don t take it personally remember that when an elderly person is irritable it likely is not your fault sometimes you might be the only person they are interacting with that day so they unfairly take their anger out on you try not to take their negativity to heart 5 x research source when you remember not to take it personally you will become more objective that will allow you to step back from the situation and more clearly assess the problem change your perspective remember that generational gaps can cause issues in communication when there is a big difference in age there can also be significant differences in opinions and and views try to be respectful of the elderly person s view point shift your perspective to try to see where they are coming from asking questions can be a great way to help you change your perspective getting more information can help you understand the elderly person s point of view take a deep breath sometimes it can be very frustrating to deal with an irritable person it can even feel like nothing you do is right often the best thing you can do is just to calm yourself down and mentally reset 6 x research source practice deep breathing take several lengthy inhales and take measured exhales this will lower your heart rate and your stress level take a break it can sometimes be very useful to take a time out from a frustrating situation if you feel like the other person s cranky nature is negatively affecting you it is normal to feel like you need a mental break taking a step back can allow you to calm down and return to the conversation when you are mentally refreshed 7 x research source focus on the positives remember that you are interacting with this person for a reason chances are that there is something that you like about them for example maybe it is your elderly aunt who is routinely cranky try to focus on remembering the fun you used to have making christmas cookies with her 8 x research source if the irritable person is a fairly new acquaintance it might be a little harder to think of something positive try to find a detail that is positive for example if the cranky person is your neighbor maybe focus on the fact that they never have noisy parties offer to help once you have determined what the problem is you can extend an offer to help make sure that your offer is genuine do not offer to help if you are unable to or do not sincerely want to instead extend an sincere and concrete offer of assistance 9 x research source for example your elderly mother might be having difficulty taking care of her home ask her if she would like you to hire a cleaning service or help her find an assisted care living situation be empathetic being empathetic means that you try to put yourself in the other person s shoes once you know why this person is cranky try to think about how you would feel in their situation then try to determine what would make you feel better 10 x research source elderly people are often lonely and this can account for their unfriendly disposition offer your company and suggest an activity the two of you can do together such as playing a card game ask for assistance you might not be able to solve the other person s problem especially if you do not know the elderly person well the situation might be out of your hands what you can do instead is ask for assistance try reaching out to close friends or relatives of the elderly person to see what they suggest provide resources most cities have senior centers where older people can go for recreational activities other organizations such as churches and libraries also offer programs geared towards seniors you could look up some local resources and provide that information to your neighbor or relative this could be potentially very helpful and go a long way towards lifting their mood 11 x research source remain positive it can be very draining to deal with a cranky senior citizen the most important thing you can do is to remain positive remember that you are doing a good thing by being kind and helpful even if your help is not obviously appreciated you are probably making an impact 12 x research source smile when it is difficult to remain positive try putting a smile on your face even if it feels false at first the simple act of smiling will make you feel better

how to live with an elderly person,living with an elderly person has both rewards and challenges for everyone involved but we also need to respect the need of older people to feel self sufficient and independent while also offering assistance where assistance is needed both parties need to be patient and understand their unique living situation in order to make it work ultimately as all people are different all situations will be unique as well and everyone will face unique challenges but if both parties are open to communicating with each other then the living situation will be a happy and mutually beneficial one,communicate with your elderly roommate communication is the most important element of any relationship if you don t communicate you won t know each other s problems and concerns as a result you won t be able to form a relationship that is respecting of both of your unique qualities define boundaries both parties need to define boundaries and come to a mutual agreement about each other s space independence and autonomy you need to understand what your elderly person is comfortable with when it comes to being assisted or being subtly monitored to make sure they are okay talk to them about their expectations about your relationship what do they expect of you in terms of assistance and interaction discuss use of shared space like the bathroom kitchen or living room come to an agreement about under what circumstances family or friends will visit discuss use of each other s personal belongings like dishes appliances and even food figure out finances figure out who pays for what ahead of time having finances decided and agreed upon ahead of time could save you from a headache or even legal fees in the future records will make a big difference here

cost this will help you avoid problems and resentment in the future consider the cost if you will be covering the cost of your elderly relative be informed about the costs one recent study found that

your elderly roommate support the older person s autonomy let him or her make their own choices and do not substitute your own judgement for theirs every adult has the capacity to make at least some if not all of his or her own decisions so help enhance the person s capacity to do and choose as much as possible for himself or herself don t assume merely because of advanced age that people cannot manage their own affairs even if you do not agree with them appreciate their wisdom and life experiences you re the younger person with less experience your elderly roommate probably has wisdom and experience well beyond your own talk to them and ask them for guidance on issues that pertain to both of you make sure the house is accessible depending on the older person s physical condition you will need to consider several things in order to make your home accessible install mobility aids if the person needs them consider grab bars at the toilet and bath tub also consider a shower seat in addition consider a wheelchair ramp or an electric wheelchair lift protect the person from the potential dangers of stairs think about this if the older person is needs to access any areas that are not on the main level of a home equip your home with handicap accessible features is the bathroom big enough to handle a wheelchair or walker if necessary for a wheelchair the doorway needs to be at

limitations as different people have different problems and abilities as they age you need to quickly determine what kind of abilities and or assistance they will need if they have decreased abilities and physical or mental limitations there are several factors you need to consider what is the person s physical and mental condition and what chronic illness does the person have if so you need to take these into account and prepare for them is the person of sound mind if your elderly roommate has or is developing dementia or alzheimer s you need to seriously consider what you are going to do

older people including con men salespeople and people claiming to represent religious organizations such people will solicit money from older people by taking advantage of their good nature or lack of proper information turning these people away at the door or simply asking your elderly roommate about their daily interactions over dinner might prevent this this will not just protect your elderly roommate from financial disaster but it will also save you a headache in dealing with the repercussions understand their dietary needs including sugar or salt intake older people are often on restricted diets and are tempted just like the rest of us if your elderly roommate is suffering from memory problems they might even forget about their own dietary needs but remember don t nag or be overly aggressive when it comes to this respect their choices while watching out for their welfare,Family-Life

in order to curb this risk you should make sure to really tire the dog out before the meeting 2 x research source if the dog is tired out it is less likely to be really wild and uncontrollable however there are some dogs that will be really active when meeting new people or old friends no matter how much exercise you give them make this judgement for yourself based on your particular dog do extensive training in order to keep an elderly person really safe around an active dog you need to control that dog s behavior extensive training that the dog consistently responds to is the best way to control its behavior training requires daily practice with your dog clear and consistent directions and positive reinforcement to encourage your dog to follow your commands with a well trained dog you can allow the dog to be around an elderly person unrestrained because you know that it will stop dangerous behavior immediately if commanded training that is very successful will allow you to control your dog s behavior no matter what it is doing with a simple command this type of training takes a long time to complete don t expect to get total control over your dog s actions in a week or two it takes lots and lots of repetition and positive reinforcement to instill in your dog allow the dog to smell the person ahead of time if you are planning on introducing your dog to a family member then you can let the dog smell his or her smells ahead of time getting a piece of clothing or a sheet or blanket that the person uses and letting your dog smell it ahead of time will let the dog get the excitement of new smells over with if the dog has already smelled someone then doing this before he or she comes over will not generally diffuse the dog s excitement this tactic is usually just helpful for first time encounters this technique is used often when introducing dogs to new babies but can work with other types of situations as well keep them separated the easiest way to keep elderly people safe around active dogs is to keep them separated this may mean putting the dog in its crate out in the yard or in a separate room that is closed off while an elderly person is visiting 3 x research source placing an active dog in an isolated location may require that you train it not to bark or cry as well in some cases an active dog that is isolated from the group my be very upset

place baby gates or obstacles in the way that keep the dog in a separate space from the elderly person 4 x research source this solution works best for dogs that cannot jump and that will not use

leash if the dog needs to be in the same room as the elderly person then you will need to keep a firm hold on it this is most easily done by keeping a leash on it and holding that leash tightly 5 x

introductions it is important that you don t just let the dog go and let it jump all over a new person even if the dog can t actually knock that person over or injure it instead make the introduction gradually so that the dog is never allowed to act inappropriately towards the elderly person this is where a leash comes in handy because you can let the dog sniff the new person and the new person can pet the dog but the dog can be stopped from jumping or generally getting too active during the introduction this gradual introduction may be most effective in a neutral location such as outside at a park this reduces the chance that the dog will be protective over its space and act badly set firm boundaries with the dog there are some things a dog should never do to an elderly person and the dog needs to know that for example a dog should never jump up on an elderly person as this could cause them to fall over your dog needs to know that it is never to jump up and that that kind of

have to contend with do a search for local nursing homes and assisted living facilities if there aren t many facilities in the area then there is probably a need for your services 2 x research source if there is a lot of competition in your area you should consider opening your facility elsewhere for example opening a new nursing home in the same town as a large well funded and established nursing home may be a bad move try looking at the surrounding areas instead develop a specialty to distinguish your facility from others even if there is competition in your area you can effectively compete

reputation for bad service take the whole package into account you may also be able to contact the manufacturers directly for equipment this may be cheaper than working with supply companies remember that all of this equipment is expensive have a steady stream of funding secured before buying it find a location that can fit enough patients to make a profit the size of your facility is a balancing act more patients lead to more expenses but you need a minimum number of patients to bring in enough money to operate after adding up your operating costs consider what you need to bring in every

keep an open mind no situation has to last forever do your research and try different options if you and your parents do not like the first option that you have chosen try a different one present

present logical reasons to make it more difficult for your parents to argue against the move trust a friend or other family member if your parents are resistant to the idea of moving try and enlist a friend or confidant to help join the conversation perhaps you parent has a close sibling or doctor that they confide in bargain with your parents this may not seem like the best option as you may not

can look for other options if you don t like facility how about this one or this one okay i understand you don t want to talk about this now we ll talk about it tomorrow present a united front with

items are involved make a copy of this list and give it to your parents the movers the doctors or facility director pare down items chances are your parents are moving into a much smaller space than before your parents may have accumulated a lot of items throughout the years take the time now to go through the items and get rid of sell donate or keep things this task may be overwhelming so be

initial on clothes labels and keep labels on personal items make sure valuable are insured and are kept in safe places ask what is already available before you make the big move call the facility to ask what has already been provided ask about furniture dishes silverware kitchen items towels sheets blankets etc toiletries discuss power of attorney power of attorney is essentially designated another individual to act on your behalf 7 x research source talk with your parents before they move to see if they want to sign over this power to someone in the family this can help with financial or medical decisions this is particularly helpful in situations of limited health or mobility be in frequent contact your parents may be nervous or anxious in this move do not just leave them to their own devices make frequent contact via phone or visits while they adjust to their new space get your parents involved in activities talk to the facility director or nurses on staff to see what

how to help aging parents living far away,as more parents live longer lives and more adult children seem to relocate for work or other reasons the number of long distance caregivers a person living more than an hour away continues to grow if you are caring for your parent s from a distance know that there are at least seven million americans in the same boat as you 1 x research source as a long

nightstand the need is the same you should create a place where you can collect store and easily locate important information regarding care for your parent s 2 x research source by establishing a one stop repository for important information and resources you will make it not only easier to find what you need but also to share it with siblings family members or other caregivers distribute copies and provide updates as needed identify local contacts when you live far away you simply cannot respond immediately in person to emergency or time sensitive situations by maintaining a list of local contacts who can provide assistance you can help to ensure an immediate helping presence for your parent s when needed 3 x research source get names numbers emails etc for trusted neighbors physicians pharmacists local caregivers social workers and so on as well as detailed contact info for your parent s and other close family members keep them in the care notebook and distribute copies organize and help with paperwork when you live far away from a parent you can t personally help much with tasks like picking up groceries tidying up the house and so on you can however provide a wide range of important administrative roles like organizing and dealing with medical legal and financial papers and information 4 x research source thanks to the internet you can pay bills for your parent s keep tabs on healthcare issues and financial investments and provide help in a range of other important areas that can sometimes overwhelm older adults don t just take over without having a substantive discussion first though make sure independence and privacy are respected if you need to take a more active role talk about getting durable power of attorney so you can make important decisions for your parent s for healthcare matters you should be designated as a healthcare proxy and sign the required papers so you can discuss medical matters with doctors insurers etc coordinate local assistance for all the help and support you can provide from afar and during occasional visits often the time will come when your parent s need daily assistance this may mean calling the local agency on aging to arrange for meal deliveries or visits from a home health aide or it may mean hiring a geriatric care manager to help with ongoing care and decisions 5 x research source geriatric care managers are usually licensed nurses or social workers with experience in assessing the needs of and coordinating resources for seniors research and interview prospective candidates and ask about their licensing experience pay rate etc to identify information on local resources and especially the availability of financial assistance contact the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in the u s or the comparable entity in other nations 6 x research source some areas of the u s also have programs in which trained usps mail carriers can provide wellness checks on seniors the carrier alert program 7 x research source ask leading questions it can be difficult to tell how a parent is doing over the phone as you are likely to get a lot of i m fine and we re doing ok responses you don t want to turn your calls into interrogations they should hopefully be calming and enjoyable for everyone involved but do try to add in some basic detective work by way of questions that may draw out more detailed answers 8 x research source for instance instead of asking have you been eating try what s on the lunch menu for today or bring up the weather and see if you can lead your parent to talk about the last time he or she left the house even when you are visiting in person come up with some questions that require more than a yes or no response about health caring for the house paying bills etc assess and address living conditions when you live far away you probably only get to visit occasionally and usually with advance notice this can make it easier for your parent s to mask problems going on at home before each visit prepare a checklist of potential concerns house maintenance medication adherence etc you want to investigate while there 9 x research source make the most of each visit by planning ahead see if you can align your visit with existing appointments so you can go along carve out some time to fix the leaky faucet or deal with the stack of bills you know has been piling up of course also make sure you leave enough time to make the visit enjoyable for everyone go to appointments with your parent s especially if you ve planned ahead with your visits you should be able to tag along on medical financial legal or other important appointments discuss the matter beforehand so you aren t springing the idea on your parent s at the last minute and be clear that you are there to be supportive and helpful not to take over 10 x research source make sure you have obtained legal authorization to discuss a parent s personal matters with a doctor attorney or financial advisor prepare a list of questions for yourself and help your parent with questions he or she may have if you are already actively involved in the organization and management of important matters while away from your parent s you can accomplish more during your visits discuss healthcare and end of life preferences whether or not you are the recognized healthcare proxy for a parent you should engage in a thorough discussion regarding preferences for when a serious illness or the end of life arrives it can require some tact and sensitivity to bring up such matters when your parents are healthy but it is still preferable to waiting too long and missing the chance to clearly identify their wishes 11 x research source ideally if you have siblings or other involved family members you should try to hold a group meeting to discuss these important matters doing so before a serious situation arises can help keep everyone calm and focused and more able to make rational decisions make sure your parents are as involved as possible and in fact taking the lead if conditions allow it they should be in charge of these important decisions whenever possible share the load with other family members in many situations the child who lives closest to an aging parent is left to shoulder most or sometimes all of the care responsibilities if you live far away and have siblings or other involved family members try to work together to coordinate care so that everyone is contributing in a fair and sensible manner 12 x research source proximity will dictate how many responsibilities are divided of course the closest sibling is likely to be the one running to the store while one who lives far away might pay bills online also consider your relative strengths and available time though a famously disorganized brother may not be the best choice for handling all the important paperwork for example consider options for moving especially if you don t have other family members sharing the burden you may want to consider shrinking the distance component of your long distance care this might involve moving your parent s into your home or to a residence closer to you you might also think that it is a good idea for your parent s to move from home and into a retirement community or assisted living facility for instance regardless of distance 13 x research source 14 x research source take time to consider the pros and cons of moving though because it is a significant decision to make moving your parent s into your home will probably save money and make daily care much easier but it is also a major upheaval for all parties involved make sure you consult and consider the preferences of your parent s will this be a welcome opportunity for closer bonding or will the loss of independence and abandonment of a longtime home cause problems moving far away also means finding new doctors new caregivers and helpers new friends and so on sometimes it is a necessary change especially if your parent s are simply not safe or sufficiently cared for at home but it shouldn t be taken lightly take care of yourself too even if you aren t providing direct care on a daily basis like a local caregiver being a long distance caregiver is physically and emotionally taxing it can sometimes be even more stressful because it is more difficult to perceive the difference you are making in order to effectively care for your parent s though you need to take care of yourself physically and emotionally 15 x research source long distance caregivers may discount or ignore the amount of work they do to help loved ones often because they don t feel like they are doing the daily hard work even though most long distance caregivers spend the equivalent of one day per week providing care they tend to feel less satisfied and more guilty for not doing enough than close caregivers 16 x research source remember that there are seven million other people in the u s alone providing long distance care wherever you live you are not alone as a long distance caregiver support networks are available and talking to others going through the same challenges can provide significant emotional and even physical benefits 17 x research source,Family-Life

how to adapt to aging and elderly parents,as we grow older our parents tend to become challenging and sometimes interfering as we ourselves try to mold and create a life of our own with age our parents lose their memories become stubborn and question any suggestions made by their children or grandchildren they have a right to be right for they ve been around much longer and their wisdom and experiences in life quite outshine yours,always remember that disagreements are a normal part of daily life if everyone agreed on everything life will become mundane and monotonous respect the decisions and values of the older generation they simply have a different view on life that may not be in keeping with up to date technology and modern times they have raised you so give them some credit for the way you turned out try to meet them halfway by blending your own ideals with those of theirs you may come up with a spectacular solution that you never thought of before do not marginalize the older parent by excluding them completely from important decision making activities very often we tend to give very little credit to the vast experience and the wisdom of our elderly parents marginalization makes the parent feel hopeless and unwanted which in turn leaves them with no choice but to become rebellious and look to others for comfort usefulness and belonging realize that the memory tends to fail with age as our parents age the memory capacity tends to weaken very often they will forget to remember completing little chores or taking a proper message for you by telephone please be patient as you would when dealing with a child the natural course of time is having an effect on their memories and this is seldom due to carelessness or sloppiness avoid becoming agitated or passing hurtful and sarcastic comments understand that elderly parents will suffer a general decline in health be supportive when they complain about minor aches and pains avoid adopting the attitude of neglect or simply ignoring every little complaint you are faced with drive them to the local clinic hospital or even a private doctor if the need arises you may save them from further harm to their health and their general well being this also proves to them that you care and parents take great comfort in knowing that their child or children care for them remember that you too will reach old age at some point in time the cycle of life continues as does everything else you will not want to be treated badly by your own kids so refrain from doing the same to your parents give them the respect and dignity they deserve one can understand that aging parents can be difficult sometimes even completely unreasonable listen with attention and find the humor in this to help you relax and calm or smooth the situation over always remember that you are what you are because of them due to the proper care and nourishment they afforded you with the buck does not stop here it is the duty of every child to act with responsibility to aging and elderly parents make them a part of your daily life in the middle of being busy with your own life and family try including your parents into this daily routine other issues such as medication times need to be scheduled into your other activities to cater for the needs of ailing parents where possible use hired help if necessary incorporate the help and input from other siblings or family members make them proud of themselves and you a comfort dwells when parents know that their children are there for them when or if the need arises the smiles and happiness reciprocates leaving you feeling fulfilled and content,Family-Life

to the mix and elder care can become a major source of family conflict while some of your family baggage from childhood might always be present and new conflicts may arise based on family members responses to the situation you can take steps to minimize conflict as you and your siblings take care of your aging parents start by communicating openly and regularly with your family members after that work on dividing responsibilities equitably and finding healthy ways to resolve disputes,expect the unexpected old conflicts from childhood can have a way of reappearing when you and your siblings start taking care of your parents but it is just as likely that this major change will bring about new dynamics between you and your siblings don t assume that just because you and your sister fought as children you won t be able to work together to care for your children or maybe you will have some heated disagreements with the sibling you were always closest to a parent s illness and impending death brings about unpredictable results and you can t know how anyone including you will react accept your siblings for who they are and you ll have a better starting point for resolving conflicts and improving your relationships 1 x research source you and your family are entering uncharted territory and things may shift when your parents become ill or pass away how you deal with illness and death may change drastically in the time between when one parent passes and when the next passes make sure your parents have indicated their preferences for care it can be practical for your parents to complete documents to indicate which of their children will hold the power of attorney and who will hold the power of guardianship if they become incapacitated having these questions settled ahead of time can prevent a lot of sibling conflicts before they begin 2 x research source for example you might sit down with your parent as a part of a proactive health plan and say mom have you thought about who you would like to make decisions on your behalf if you ever become incapacitated and what your wishes would be i think we should talk about this early on so that your wishes are followed in the event it ever happens respect your parents choices even if you don t agree with them if your parent asks you to fulfill a role that you don t think you could handle for instance if they would want you to take them off life support if they are brain dead but your religious or moral beliefs conflict with this then tell your parents so they can assign that role to another sibling remember that no one expects these things to happen and it may be un pleasant to talk about but it is necessary and can save you a great deal of strife later on put a sibling agreement in writing you can prevent disagreements down the line by establishing expectations and allotting tasks ahead of time sit down with your siblings and decide who should be the primary caregiver how you will handle expenses and where your parents will live put this information in a document that all of you can reference 3 x research source if you can make your sibling agreement while your parents are still in good health not when you have emotionally fraught decisions hanging over your family a mediator can help you write your sibling agreement if you and your siblings have a hard time negotiating with each other put your parents well being first remember that the most important part of elder care is keeping your parents as healthy safe and happy as possible fighting with your siblings distracts you from this task and stresses your parents out too you can t control what your siblings do but you can take the high road to avoid conflict as much as possible 4 x research source there are some situations when you shouldn t look the other way for the sake of preventing conflict if you think that one of your siblings may be coercing or stealing from an elderly parent contact your local adult protective services hire a family counselor or an elder mediator if you and your siblings cannot get along it may be a good idea to get a third party involved family counseling can help you address relationship problems and learn to cooperate better if counseling is not an option an elder mediator can help you and your siblings reach agreements about your parents care 5 x research source if your parent s have a family attorney overseeing their affairs this individual can probably refer you to other professionals with the experience needed to help you resolve any disagreements in a peaceful manner assign tasks based on people s abilities talk with your siblings to decide who should take on which responsibilities split up tasks based on what your siblings are good at or what they can do easily 6 x research source for instance if your sister is an accountant maybe she should be in charge of your parents finances or if one sibling is having an exceptionally difficult time dealing with the parent s illness do not assign them the role of healthcare power of attorney find ways for distant siblings to help out just because one sibling lives far away doesn t mean they can t contribute perhaps they can chip in extra money towards your parents care find ways to visit more frequently or call their parents several times a week 7 x research source avoid making decisions about your parents care without talking to far flung siblings first they may want to help just as much as you do and feel upset if you leave them out remember that this new situation means that roles and dynamics may be changing so don t assume that a sibling who was not involved with the family in the past won t want to be very involved now avoid trying to divide tasks equally it will probably never be possible for you and your siblings to split elder care tasks equally especially if you have different income levels or live in different locations accept that one of you may end up doing a bit more work than the others and focus on finding ways for each sibling to contribute to the best of their ability 8 x research source let your siblings know if you need more help avoid assuming that you shouldn t have to ask your siblings to help you out more they may not realize you re feeling overwhelmed unless you tell them so instead of letting your resentment build tell your siblings what kind of help you need 9 x research source ask for help in concrete terms say something like can you start picking up groceries for mom every week i m having a hard time fitting it in with my other errands schedule regular discussions with your siblings meet with your siblings as early as possible to discuss how you will care for your parents in your family discussions focus on keeping everyone up to date on your parents current health and their wishes for their care in the future 10 x research source it s best to start talking about elder care options before your parents have a health crisis or become otherwise unable to take care of themselves this may not happen of course but it is a proactive way to handle caring for an aging parent meet in person if possible getting together in person will help all your siblings feel involved in your parents care if they are not closely involved in care taking try to schedule your family meetings on long weekends or at other times when everyone can be present if it s not possible for all your siblings to be at a meeting schedule a conference call so that you can still talk face to face 11 x research source include your parents in your discussions if your parents are still of sound mind have them come to your family meetings and give their input including your parents in the decision making process will ensure they get the kind of care they want and it can head off some sibling disagreements before they develop 12 x research source as a rule of thumb it may be best to have a pre discussion to analyze options and hash out disagreements before the parents enter the conversation disagreement between siblings may cause anxiety or frustration in elderly parents what s more they may be overwhelmed by too many options narrowing down the choices between you beforehand can help the discussion go more smoothly use your judgment about when to make decisions without your parents input avoid involving them in conversations that might upset them for instance if you and your siblings think your father shouldn t drive anymore it s probably best to discuss the issue without him at first check in regularly elder care is an ongoing process so it s important that everyone is kept updated schedule regular meetings either in person or via conference call to stay in touch with any caretakers and stay informed about your parents health and needs 13 x research source avoid leaving some siblings out of the loop about your parents care even if they live far away or don t seem very interested this is a whole family process and leaving them out can lead to resentment and hurt,Family-Life

around their age you might ask legal questions like have you made a will you could ask health questions like when was your last doctor s visit were there any concerns you should also ask your parents if they have a financial plan for their future look into community services there are many community service agencies available to child caregivers and their parents many of these services may be covered by your parents insurance plans services may include adult day care centers home health aides home delivered meals transportation skilled nursing mental health support services and financial advocacy and guidance services if your parent is a veteran home health care coverage financial support home care services and more are available some of these services may be free to your veteran parent through the veteran s administration while others require a co payment this depends on many factors including your parents military discharge status when they served income status and if there are any disabilities attached to their service discharge check with your local va to find out if your parent is eligible help your parents make appropriate arrangements your parents may not understand how to make the arrangements needed things like creating a will or analyzing finances might be difficult the difficulty is often enough to deter people from completing those essential tasks 2 x

depending on your parent s age and health the care they require will be different maybe they need as little as stopping by a couple of times a month to move heavy things or possibly they need round the clock care your parent may not be capable of determining their needs and you will have to use your best judgement for example if your parents are very mobile and mentally alert they may need very little help from you if your parents are forgetful and often leave the stove on or lock themselves out of the house you might consider more extensive care this could include hiring a home health professional living with your parents or having your parents live with you identify what types of caregiving they require take some time to talk with your parents and find out what specific type of caregiving they need make a list and then look over it to identify what you are and are not capable of doing on your own be realistic about your capabilities and the amount of time you can

decisions and it is important to respect this be prepared to find suitable advisers that your parents might need for example if they need good financial or legal advice help them to find a good

lifestyle their opinions and their beliefs gets much harder as they age your views might differ a lot or you may even oppose their views but it s best to agree to disagree arguing vehemently won t change their mind and is likely to create a lot of tensions have trust in your parents they have made their choices based on the things that mattered to them in the past and that still matter to them now there will always be generation gaps but there are also similarities amid the differences connect with your parents on the things that both of you care about and believe in such as family the well being of your children and shared interests consider learning more about an interest a parent has use the internet to find out more on any subject and ask questions based on your research your parent will be thrilled that you want to find out more try to move beyond differences of opinion no doubt you will still have some differences of opinion but always look for the common ground allay their fears that you are going to argue by simply agreeing that they may have a point and then change the subject stay calm although there are years of emotional experiences between both of you it is important to respond to your parents in a calm and caring way avoid being patronizing if you end up brushing off your parent s viewpoints and treat them like children they will feel insulted it is important to be kind in all your approaches to your parents and not come across as condescending towards them find out what your elderly parents need done start by simply asking them and listening to their needs if they re too proud to say they need help or they can t think of anything take a look around and see what might need doing you can help out in many ways such as running errands for your parents doing shopping collecting medication etc walking their dog if they are finding it harder to take the dog for a walk every day help out on a few days to give them a break reading for them or

help him or her if this happens your first goal should be to get your loved one away from the person responsible for the abuse or neglect for example if you re concerned that your elderly mother is being abused by your cousin who has moved into her home to care for her you may want to make the effort to visit her more often or even arrange to spend weekends with her in her home if the caregiver

your report or if something else happens you should contact the aps office to find out how you can update the case file meet with the caseworker once the agency receives your report it will be

contacted to provide further information or otherwise assist the caseworker in some situations you may be asked to accompany the caseworker when he or she visits your loved one this is most likely to happen in cases where the elderly person has significant problems with confusion or memory loss the caseworker also may need your assistance getting in touch with other friends or family members of the elderly person at various points during the investigation the caseworker may want to discuss options with you for removing your loved one from the abusive situation or getting other help follow up

she may file a police report or recommend that you take further legal action such as filing a lawsuit police officers also may conduct periodic well being checks if there is concern for your loved one s safety particularly if there is suspicion that he or she is being abused by his or her caretaker often caseworkers will monitor a situation and require regular reports until it is determined that the person is safe and in no danger of further abuse or neglect if the caseworker makes any recommendations for your loved one s care review them carefully keep in mind that the caseworker may have access to resources you weren t aware of if the caseworker comes to conclusions that you don t agree with call the aps office and ask to speak to his or her supervisor keep going up the chain of

new friend who is offering to run errands or take care of financial matters keep in mind that elderly people particularly those with confusion or memory loss issues can easily be tricked into going along with something they never would have agreed to otherwise you also should note behavioral signs which may be signs of financial abuse or of emotional abuse or manipulation if your loved one seems

sometimes even professionals get it wrong file fraud complaints with the applicable agencies if your loved one is the victim of a scam you may be able to file a fraud report with one of several different government agencies depending on the method of contact used 14 x research source for example if your loved one has been duped by a fraudulent telemarketer you can file a complaint against

would give you standing to sue them for a violation of that contract some states have special elder abuse laws that provide certain family members with standing to sue if the elder is unable to handle the litigation or discussions with the attorney for example a california court held that a granddaughter had standing to sue her uncle for the elder abuse of her grandmother 17 x research source

questions to ask before you sign a contract with a company that provides medical alert monitoring services,decide who you want to be notified depending on where you live and how independent your senior is you may or may not opt for a system that includes monitoring services there are many systems on the market that are connected to call centers allowing emergency response teams to be dispatched directly to the senior s home upon activation these products typically charge monthly fees if you don t think your senior needs this level of monitoring or if there are many close friends and family members nearby who can check on the senior you may also consider a wearable product that automatically calls a list of pre programmed phone numbers allowing your senior to call loved ones for help without having to get to the phone 1 x research source consider automatic detection features many systems offer a simple push button that allows seniors to call for help whenever they need it there are also newer products on the market however that offer a higher level of protection many companies now offer units with automatic fall detection capabilities which means your senior will get

your senior has spent sitting or lying down and whether there are any abnormal vital signs 3 x research source there are also products on the market that will send health monitoring information

to be monitored if your senior does not leave the house alone often you can choose a home based unit which is connected to either a landline or a cellular connection and only connects the senior to monitoring services within a specific range if your senior is more active you may want to consider a gps enabled device which will allow your senior to signal for help from anywhere and will notify emergency responders of her exact location 4 x research source if you are considering a home based unit find out if the base unit can be easily transferred to a different house this will be important if your senior moves one day if she spends the winters in a warmer climate or if she just visits out of town family from time to time be sure to check the range on home based units as they are all different some may allow for a connection while the senior is in the yard for example while others may not if your senior spends time in the yard you will definitely want to make sure this area is covered some gps enabled devices may also allow caregivers to see the senior s location via a mobile app which could be helpful if your senior is prone to getting lost ask about personal preferences one of the most important things to consider when choosing a medical alert system is whether or not your senior will actually wear the device there are many different options available including pendants bracelets belt clips and more some are more stylish than others which may encourage a reluctant senior to wear them even the best system will be of no use if the senior does not wear the device so make sure she is comfortable with it and agrees to wear it every day 5 x research source some systems include the option for stationary buttons to be placed around the house if you are concerned that your senior may not wear a pendant or other wearable device consider placing emergency buttons in the areas of the home where she is most likely to fall 6 x research source there are

emergency and forget to use the medical alert device if you think this is likely to happen to your senior you may want to opt for automatic detection options plan for the future make sure to think not only about how the medical alert system will function for your senior right now but also about how it might function for her as she continues to age the senior may be able to push a button to summon for help or reset the system today but may not be able to a year from now think about what other options the system offers be sure your contract is flexible allowing you to make any necessary changes so the plan will continue to meet your needs down the road make sure your senior understands the system be careful not to choose a system that your senior will not be able to operate if she is not tech savvy choose a more user friendly device no matter what system you choose make sure to go over the operation with her so she knows exactly how to use it in case of an emergency requesting a trial of a system is a great idea especially if you are unsure if your senior will be comfortable with the technology ask about price depending on the system you may have the option to buy or lease the equipment find out about the upfront and monthly costs for all the systems that meet your senior s needs 7 x research source ask about false alarm charges if the senior pushes the alert button

cancellation fees and if you are required to pay for a minimum number of months some systems may give you many different contract options so choose the one that makes the most sense for you if you only need temporary monitoring for your senior while she is recovering from surgery for example be extra careful about making sure you won t be on the hook for any extra fees get the facts on the monitoring services ask the companies lots of detailed questions about their services to make sure you are getting the best quality service for your loved one ask about response time it will be very important to know how soon your loved one will get help in the event of an emergency you should also understand what systems are needed for the device to work for example if the system is tied to a cellular network but your senior has poor cell reception at home this might be a bad choice find out if the company takes care of the monitoring in house or if they outsource the service if they do it themselves ask about how they train their employees if they outsource monitoring services do some research on that company as well seek a plan that provides 24 7 coverage if you want and can afford around the clock monitoring and service ask specific questions about the technology you will probably already know a lot about the medical alert systems that fit your needs by this point but there are still a lot of important technical questions you will need to ask the providers determine if there is a guarantee on parts or service and whether the company offers technical support find out if the battery is rechargeable or replaceable if it is rechargeable ask how often it needs to be charged inquire about the availability of waterproof monitoring devices ask if the system automatically tests itself it is vital that the system is monitored regularly to ensure that it is working properly find out where the speaker is some devices allow seniors to communicate with the response team through a speaker on the wearable device while others have a speaker connected to the phone 8 x research source if you have two or more seniors who you would like to monitor in the same house find out if the system is capable of handling your needs 9 x research source check reviews research the company online to determine if it is reputable and to find out what other people are saying about their services think about how long they have been in business and how their prices compare to their competitors if possible reach out to people you know who use the system,Family-Life

how to keep elderly family safe around active dogs,having an active dog around an elderly family member can be dangerous for that person the energy and enthusiasm the dog has can easily knock over or injure a person that does not have quick reflexes or a lot of strength and stability 1 x research source in order to avoid this you should prepare your dog before the encounter protect the elderly person while he or she is around the dog and help the elderly person interact safely with the dog if they want to with some preparation and some international control over the interaction your elderly family member can be kept safe and sound around your dog,tire the dog out take your dog for a long walk or let it run around at a dog park before being around elderly people you can also play fetch or another game where the dog runs around a lot to tire it out most of the danger of having an active dog around elderly people is that the dog might knock them down or injure them just out of excitement in order to curb this risk you should make sure to really tire the dog out before the meeting 2 x research source if the dog is tired out it is less likely to be really wild and uncontrollable however there are some dogs that will be really active when meeting new people or old friends no matter how much exercise you give them make this judgement for yourself based on your particular dog do extensive training in order to keep an elderly person really safe around an active dog you need to control that dog s behavior extensive training that the dog consistently responds to is the best way to control its behavior training requires daily practice with your dog clear and consistent directions and positive reinforcement to encourage your dog to follow your commands with a well trained dog you can allow the dog to be around an elderly person unrestrained because you know that it will stop dangerous behavior immediately if commanded training that is very successful will allow you to control your dog s behavior no matter what it is doing with a simple command this type of training takes a long time to complete don t expect to get total control over your dog s actions in a week or two it takes lots and lots of repetition and positive reinforcement to instill in your dog allow the dog to smell the person ahead of time if you are planning on introducing your dog to a family member then you can let the dog smell his or her smells ahead of time getting a piece of clothing or a sheet or blanket that the person uses and letting your dog smell it ahead of time will let the dog get the excitement of new smells over with if the dog has already smelled someone then doing this before he or she comes over will not generally diffuse the dog s excitement this tactic is usually just helpful for first time encounters this technique is used often when introducing dogs to new babies but can work with other types of situations as well keep them separated the easiest way to keep elderly people safe around active dogs is to keep them separated this may mean putting the dog in its crate out in the yard or in a separate room that is closed off while an elderly person is visiting 3 x research source placing an active dog in an isolated location may require that you train it not to bark or cry as well in some cases an active dog that is isolated from the group my be very upset about that isolation place barriers to restrict your dog s movement if you cannot put the dog in a totally separate room you can at least force it to keep physical distance from the elderly person place baby gates or obstacles in the way that keep the dog in a separate space from the elderly person 4 x research source this solution works best for dogs that cannot jump and that will not use their brute strength to knock down an obstacle also using a baby gate does not keep your dog from barking or whining incessantly in order to stop this you will need to train it not to keep the dog on leash if the dog needs to be in the same room as the elderly person then you will need to keep a firm hold on it this is most easily done by keeping a leash on it and holding that leash tightly 5 x research source if you have a harness on the dog this can also be used to hold onto the dog and make sure it does not knock over or otherwise injure the elderly person you are around make gradual introductions it is important that you don t just let the dog go and let it jump all over a new person even if the dog can t actually knock that person over or injure it instead make the introduction gradually so that the dog is never allowed to act inappropriately towards the elderly person this is where a leash comes in handy because you can let the dog sniff the new person and the new person can pet the dog but the dog can be stopped from jumping or generally getting too active during the introduction this gradual introduction may be most effective in a neutral location such as outside at a park this reduces the chance that the dog will be protective over its space and act badly set firm boundaries with the dog there are some things a dog should never do to an elderly person and the dog needs to know that for example a dog should never jump up on an elderly person as this could cause them to fall over your dog needs to know that it is never to jump up and that that kind of behavior has negative consequences every time if you are trying to stop a dog from jumping up on your elderly family member then you should also stop it from jumping up on anyone else consistency is key to training dogs to eliminate negative behaviors 6 x trustworthy source american kennel club the american kennel club akc is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the united states the akc advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events such as the westminster dog show go to source promote calmness encouraging excitement when the dog is interacting with an elderly person will only create more of a problem instead of asking your dog are you excited the grandma is here and riling it up you should act like nothing out of the ordinary is happening when your grandma comes to visit 7 x research source in many cases your dog will look to you to gauge what its reaction to a new person should be if you are calm and happy to see one the dog may give that reaction too if you scream and shout in excitement that someone has arrived your dog will probably mimic your reaction as well talk to the dog in a calm and quiet manner this will promote calmness teach the elderly person dog commands if your dog is active but responds really well to commands then you should teach those commands to the elderly person the dog is interacting with this will help to assure that the elderly person is safe by allowing them to have some control over the situation commands that might be of particular help are sit stay and lay down it s also good to teach the elderly person how to tell the dog to go to its bed if the dog has been trained to follow that command it will then know that it needs to leave this person alone and go calm down in its bed 8 x research

how to fake your own death,whether you re running from the cops running away from home or simply want to start your life again sometimes in life you may need to fake your own death to escape here are a few tips on how to try to fake your own death without arousing too much suspicion,decide whether or not you really want to do this faking your death is against the law almost everywhere does your situation really warrant a death fake can you just move away are you being melodramatic are there any alternatives you should only do this if you keep feeling that faking your own death is the only way to start over or escape and you have no viable alternatives 1 x research source understand the implications of faking your own death you ll be able to have no contact with any friends or relatives if you decide to let them in on it they ll most likely call the police or betray you in the end if you must let anyone know try an understanding friend who will for whatever reason never rat you out to the police family or general public stop using anything that will be traceable back to you understand that you cannot use email accounts memberships cell phones or any other personal details from your old life after you have faked your own death this is probably the trickiest of all things to get sorted before you actually do the deed 2 x research source since money is necessary to start your new life gradually withdraw cash from an account leading up to your fake death and leave behind things like credit cards and other documents clearing it completely may arouse suspicion however if you re in a hurry draw out a massive amount but leave a little behind to erase suspicion watch out for little things that may give you away avoiding acting fishy beforehand also remember not to use personal laptops computers or mobile phones unless you can change the sim card afterwards these can be used to trace you once you re gone plus people might notice that they re missing decide on a death method suicide is probably the easiest bet while it may be hard for loved ones to stomach if it s obvious your death is a suicide innocent people won t be accused of your murder also suicide is a more open and shut case chances are people will be less searching of cctv footage and personal records etc if they know you killed yourself rather than mysteriously disappearing pick a suicide method that means there is no body to be found or failing that where it would be very difficult to find a common one might include jumping off a bridge and leaving a note that implies you re about to go through with it the body may not be found easily were it actually there so police will be less suspicious when there isn t one another option is getting lost at sea in most coastal states it is possible to fake your death when lost at sea if you are missing at sea for at least six days with no communication and sufficient evidence of possible death at sea returned belongings or parts of a ship you will be declared dead this method may be difficult as the price is an entire ship still it might be less unsettling to those you love than suicide doing this might also lower the likelihood of accountability if you are caught in your new life do it plant a note for your suicide before disappearing travel out of the city as far as you can and start again with a new identity be free eliminate all contact with people from your old life unfortunately most people who ve faked their own deaths screw up this part of the process by cashing in on the insurance check they hoped to get or getting a speeding ticket if you want to get away with it you ve got to disappear completely start by hiding out for a few weeks somewhere close by like a cheap flophouse hotel for a few weeks to lay low load up on groceries and hide out watching tv while the police decide to give up on finding you when you have to go out wear a disguise eventually you ll have to start making your way elsewhere so you can go about the process of finding your new life come up with an alternate identity who do you want to be now that the old you is dead a suave gambler and poet from south carolina who decided to forego his family s tuna cannery inheritance and move to australia to work on cars a small town bartender who had to move to the bright lights of la decide who you ll want to be and start working on 3

your new image get clothes that are different from your old way of dressing and that will mask the new you people might see in the old you dress in such a way that you d be able to walk past your own mother on the street and she ll never notice you grow a beard shave your head change your hair color embrace leather do whatever you need to do to cultivate a completely different style your story what will you tell people about yourself how will you introduce yourself how can you get away with masking your old identity when you meet new people make a fake id once you ve gotten your new identity hammered out and you re using to introducing yourself as horace mcgillicutty find or consider crafting your own fake documents that will let you start your new life go somewhere you ll be unknown flying will likely be out of the question unless you ve got some great forged documents but try making your way somewhere far off by hitchhiking safely or taking the bus for cheap work under the table declaring taxes will be difficult so working under the table and staying on the move will keep you relatively safe consider working migrant labors heading west and checking out farm labor or other contract work that ll be easier get away with under the table mushroom picking in oregon or california can be lucrative as well as detasseling in indiana or peach picking in georgia move around and see the country lay low becoming a public figure probably isn t the best idea get ready to live a quiet and simple life socializing little and maintaining a mysterious mist around yourself when people start to get to close to you it s time to move on stay away from tourist locations and landmarks there will be cameras everywhere that may capture your image moreover there is an increased chance that some of those vacationers knew the old you wear a hoodie drawn over your forehead if you don t want to be seen clearly,Family-Life
how to overcome the fear of death,thanatophobia or fear of death affects millions of people worldwide for some people it can produce anxiety and or obsessional thoughts 1 x research source while thanatophobia is the fear of death and or one s own mortality a fear of dying people or dead things is known as necrophobia which is different from thanatophobia both of these fears however can be similarly related to a fear of the unknown aspects related to death known as xenophobia in another sense it is the possibility of encountering something beyond what is already known 2 x research source this can be especially true for people who are nearing the end of life as uncertainties around the death process can multiply as the reality of death becomes more imminent 3 x research source in order to become more comfortable with the unknown end of life you need to understand your phobia and work to overcome its hold on you,write down the times when you think about death the first thing to determine when dealing with a fear of death is how and how much your fear affects your life we are not often immediately aware of the environmental triggers or causes of our fears and anxiety writing about the situations in which they arise can be a helpful tool for working through these issues 4 x research source start by simply asking yourself what was going on around me when i started feeling afraid or anxious in that moment for a number of reasons this can be a very difficult question to answer at first start with the basics think back over the last few days and write down as many details as you can remember about the times you thought about death include exactly what you were doing when the thoughts arose the fear of death is very common throughout human history people have been concerned and preoccupied with the idea of death and dying this can happen for several reasons including your age your religion your level of anxiety the experience of loss and so on for example during certain transitional phases in your life you may be more prone to having a fear of death people may have a deeper preoccupation with death in the ages 4 6 10 12 17 24 and 35 55 5 x research source scholars have long philosophized about the prospect of death according to the existentialist philosopher jean paul sartre death can be a source of fear for people precisely because it is that which comes to us from the outside and transforms us into the outside 6 x research source sartre jean paul being and nothingness trans hazel barnes new york philosophical library 1956 p 545 the process of death therefore represents to us the most radical unknown dimension imaginable or in a sense unimaginable as sartre points out death has the potential to transform our living bodies back into the non human realm from which they initially emerged make note of when you feel anxious or afraid next write down any of the times you can remember deciding not to do something because you were afraid or anxious write down instances even if you aren t sure about whether or not the emotions were necessarily related in any way to death or dying compare your anxiety with thoughts of death after you have one list of thoughts of death and one list of anxious moments look for commonalities between the two for example you might notice that every time you see a particular brand of candy you feel some degree of anxiety but you re not sure why then you realize that you think about death during these same situations you might remember that the brand of candy in question was served at your grandparent s funeral then you also began feeling some degree of fear at the thought of death in general such connections between objects emotions and situations can be quite subtle sometimes even more so than the scenario described above but writing them down can be a great way to start becoming more aware of them then you can better influence how you manage the way you re affected in such moments recognize the link between anxiety and anticipation fear is a potent force that can potentially influence just about anything you do if you can start to look beyond your fear you may find that the actual event you re dreading is not as terrible as think it is anxiety is usually wrapped up in anticipation about how things will or won t go it is an emotion that looks to the future keep reminding yourself that fear of death is sometimes worse than death itself who knows your death may not be as unpleasant as you imagine it to be 7 x research source be honest with yourself be completely honest and fully face the fact of your own mortality it will eat away at you until you do life becomes much more valuable when its temporarily is realized you know that you will face death

how to address a widow,there is no legal or universally correct way to address a married woman after her spouse passes away if you need to address a widow in correspondence you may feel uncertain and even nervous about which form of her name to use the most traditional approach is using mrs followed by her spouse s full name in business correspondence it s better to use her first name instead of her deceased spouse s if you feel comfortable enough you can ask the widow what she prefers,write mrs followed by her spouse s full name this is the most traditional approach and an appropriate default if you re unable to ask the widow personally what she prefers typically a widow retains and continues to be addressed by her spouse s full name until she remarries or requests otherwise 1 x research source for example if the widow s deceased spouse s name was richard hoffman address the envelope to mrs richard hoffman use mrs followed by her full married name for business matters when addressing an invitation or other personal correspondence mrs followed by the spouse s full name is traditional and preferred however in business correspondence it s more appropriate to follow mrs with her first name and married last name 2 x research source for example address the widow of richard hoffman as mrs anna hoffman address the widow of kimberley bertrand as mrs stacy bertrand business correspondence could include letters to donors constituents members patients or customers use mrs then her married last name to address her in person unless you are very close to the widow address her with the formal title mrs followed by her married last name if you knew her before her spouse passed away you will probably still address her the exact same way as before unless she requests otherwise continue referring to her this way for example how are you today mrs hoffman or mrs bertrand may i ask a question about chapter 14 use her family title followed by her married last name if your grandfather passed away continue referring to your grandmother by her familial title followed by her last name unless directed otherwise address her exactly as you did before your grandfather passed away for example grandma hoffman are you coming to town for the holidays or would you like to come with us to the movies mrs stacy bertrand use her first name and married last name in general situations a widow s married last name doesn t revert back to her maiden name when her spouse dies her last name will continue to be her married name unless she officially changes it or remarries if you re not sure what to use use her first name followed by her married last name this form is appropriate in formal public situations for example anna hoffman dr smith is ready to see you now avoid using ms or miss unless requested by the widow typically this form of address is not used unless the widow specifically asks to be addressed that way for instance if many years have passed since her spouse died or if she s dating someone new she may want to drop her spouse s full name the only way to know for certain is to ask her 3 x research source for example hi aunt anna i am mailing you an invitation to maddox s christening and i want to make sure i address it properly i know you ve been dating darrell for several years now should i stop using mrs and uncle richard s first name when addressing mail to you follow the widow s lead if she s written to you before if you ve received correspondence from the widow since her spouse s passing check the return address to see how she referred to herself using the name that she used is a good approach especially if you feel too awkward to bring up such a difficult topic with her directly 4 x research source check the upper left hand corner of the envelope for the return address her preferred name will most likely be written there if the correspondence is formal or business related rather than personal check the letter itself if she signed off on the letter her preferred form may be there for example sincerely mrs anna hoffman ask the widow directly which form she prefers if you have a personal relationship with the widow and feel comfortable doing so simply ask her how she would like to be addressed in the future it s a difficult topic to bring up but it s better for her to receive correspondence that is addressed to her properly 5 x research source you could say hi aunt anna i m getting ready to mail you a wedding invitation and i want to make sure i address it properly do you still go by uncle richard s full name in correspondence,Family-Life
how to deal with sentimental belongings of deceased loved ones,there s almost nothing that is more heartbreaking than losing a loved one second to this is going through that person s belongings this is often a heart wrenching experience because you are sorting through pieces that the person lived with and you probably have memories with many of these items although it may be difficult you can get through it by preparing yourself mentally sorting through the items with a purpose and being easy on yourself,plan your attack start your process by deciding if you are on a time crunch or if you can go slow if you re on a deadline set milestones throughout the process to keep yourself on track if you aren t in any rush take the process one step at a time don t put too much stress on yourself but don t avoid the task either deciding to go through the home room by room is one good way to start the process or you could decide to go through the belongings based on items such as books textiles chotskies etc going in without a plan can be overwhelming and can lead to more stress and heartache that you simply don t need right now 1 x research source include your family members in this process they may want to take some things for themselves they may even be willing to help you sort through the items understand that you can t keep everything as much as you want to hold onto every item that reminds you of the departed doing so is impractical not only do you likely not have room in your own home to house the items of another but not everything should necessarily be kept old newspapers raggedy towels and items that have seen much better days are those you may consider getting rid of remind yourself that letting go of items isn t disrespectful to your loved one material items are not what defined your relationship it was the memories you had together 2 x research source decide how much you are able to keep beforehand take an evaluation of your own home and decide how much room you have for your loved one s belongings before you begin sorting through their home keeping more than you have room for could result in you needing a storage unit to have a place for everything which defeats the purpose of keeping the items as you won t be able to see them be honest with yourself and then stick to what you decided 3 x research source for example maybe your mom left behind a large china collection that you really do not have space to store or display you might pass some along to your siblings for their homes or donate to goodwill start with the trash throw away any items you know you aren t keeping particularly items that will mold or go bad toiletries and pantry products are usually ones to eliminate as are items that are in bad condition unless you aren t keeping these items they should go in the trash as they probably aren t suitable for anything else 4 x research source to ensure you are ready to tackle this project equip yourself with an adequate amount of trash bags and boxes you may also recycle some items rather than throwing them away if you have a huge amount of items to be trashed consider renting a trash bin from your local trash collector to help with the process make piles after you throw away what you can t keep create two piles what you are keeping and what you are donating as the names imply you will hold onto the items in the keep pile for yourself or for others and donate or sell the items in the other pile once you make these definitive piles do something with them don t allow them to stay in the space for too long because they will just create more clutter make piles as you go through each room or sort through each item do what you re going to with the piles and then tackle the rest don t allow the piles to sit 5 x research source select items that fit into your life and have meaning for you even though your loved one would probably love it if you could take all their possession it s doubtful that they d want you to

how to find a person s grave,visiting the grave of someone who s passed away can be a great way to pay your respects and get closure or just to learn more about a historical figure however if you don t know exactly where the person was buried it might seem hard to find the gravesite luckily as long as you have just a little information about the person there are a number of ways you can find out where someone is buried,visit the cemetery if you know where it is if you know the cemetery where someone is buried but you re not sure exactly which plot is theirs take a trip to the graveyard plan to go early in the day in case it takes you a while to find the exact location 1 x research source since you ll be walking around outside bring along a bottle of water and apply sunscreen before you leave the house if you re going in the summertime you ll need to reapply the sunscreen if you ll be outside for more than 2 hours depending on the time of year and where you re going it may be a good idea to bring bug spray look online or at the visitor s center for a map some cemeteries have websites with a map of all of the graves on their grounds while others will have maps available on site if you can find a map it could save you a lot of walking while you search for an individual grave some of these maps will list individual graves while others might include only family plots some may even be just a basic grid outline of the cemetery but even that can help you streamline your search start at one side of the cemetery and make a pattern if you don t know the general location of the grave it s best to start in one corner of the cemetery and walk along the pathway from one end to the other that way you don t end up accidentally looking in the same areas you ve already been it may be helpful to bring a piece of paper and a pencil and draw a rough diagram of the cemetery to help you keep track of the plots you already looked at if it s a very large cemetery you may need to have someone else start at the other side or break your visit into multiple days reach out to the sexton of the cemetery if you still can t find the grave the cemetery sexton is the person in charge of overseeing the grounds in addition to performing general maintenance in the cemetery the sexton also keeps records of all of the burials they should be able to tell you the exact location of the gravesite 2 x research source you might also be able to speak to the clergy who oversaw the services even if they don t have a record they may remember the general area in which the person is buried contact the funeral home for help if the cemetery is privately owned some cemeteries are owned by the funeral home itself if that s the case you can contact the director of the funeral home to find out the location of the grave 3 x research source often in this situation the funeral home will be located on the grounds of the cemetery look for a family plot with the person s last name in a cemetery you ll often see last names grouped together if you see another grave with the same family name as the person you re looking for you may be getting close 4 x research source this is because families often buy multiple graves at the same time so they can be laid to rest together these groupings are called family plots compare the birth and death dates with the time the person lived just because you find a gravesite with the same name as the person you re looking for it doesn t necessarily mean you ve found them check the information on the headstone to see if the birth and death dates match up to verify it s the right grave if you don t know the person s exact date of birth or when they died at least try to estimate when they would have lived gather as much information about the person as you can when you re searching records you ll need to have the first middle and last name of the person whenever possible you re likely to have more luck if you also know their date of birth when and where they died and the names of their immediate family members 5 x research source since some combinations of first and last names are more common having the person s middle name will help narrow down your search significantly if you re not sure of the person s full name their date of birth or when they died try looking in family bibles baptismal records or obituaries you may be able to find the person s death certificate by contacting their local county clerk s office however if the person died before the 1930s they may not have a death certificate look up the person in genealogy databases if you d like to know the location of your ancestor s burial site but you don t know where to start looking a genealogy database can help even if you can t find the exact location of their grave you may be able to discover where the person lived and died which can help you narrow down where they re probably buried 6 x research source many of these sites require a fee to use all of their features although you may be able to sign up for a free trial in some cases two of the most popular genealogy websites are https www ancestry com and https www archives com visit virtual cemetery websites once you know the area where the person is buried you may be able to find their grave online at a virtual cemetery website or headstone database even if the cemetery itself doesn t maintain an independent website a database may include a photograph of their headstone and it s location in the cemetery 7 x research source in many cases volunteers take photos of gravesites and upload them one of the most popular cemetery databases is https www findagrave com you could also check https billiongraves com there may also be databases which are specific to your region for example if you re dutch you could visit https www dutchgenealogy nl online cemeteries browse sites for veterans if the person was a service member there are specific sites dedicated to preserving the locations of servicemen and women who have passed away whether they died in the line of duty or after their service had ended if the person you re searching for served in the military in some way check these sites for more information 8 x research source two sites that might be helpful include https www vets gov burials and memorials find a cemetery and https m va gov gravelocator if you re looking for someone buried in a specific military cemetery check to see if there s an independent website for instance you can find the location of a grave at arlington national cemetery by visiting

how to restore an abandoned cemetery,old cemeteries are markers of human history of all the love sweat toil tears joys and triumphs of the past they are links to family we never knew they are sources of history and they tell us a great deal about ourselves culturally and socially therefore there is nothing sadder than to come across crumbling decaying and near gone relics of cemeteries and to feel helpless to do anything about this loss of heritage yet there are indeed things that can be done to restore orphaned cemeteries and return this heritage to current communities in doing so we all regain a sense of our own place in time and history,locate a cemetery in need of tender loving care many decaying cemeteries are found in our once bustling townships in country and rural areas some are roadside cemeteries and others are neglected plots behind long abandoned churches in cities towns and villages perhaps there is one near you or maybe you remember one from your regular vacation town wherever it is make sure it is easily accessible to you so that you can visit it regularly and without too much distance or other disincentives that might stop you from being an active part of its restoration if you are not a resident of the area in which the cemetery is located this may cause red tape problems but that will depend on the area and the responsible parties ascertain the ownership and responsibility for the cemetery orphaned cemeteries are still owned by someone or some entity and often it will be a municipal responsibility start by asking at your local government office and move from there even if a church appears to be responsible for a cemetery sometimes the church has ceased to tend it through lack of funds or having moved its current cemetery to other places due to space constraints and nobody has thought to keep tending the old cemetery in many cases there may be as few as 5 10 headstones and where there are few remnants of the past like this people tend to forget you may find that there are trustees of cemeteries who are no longer able to keep up their perpetual care owing to age death or funds having run out be sure to find out who may have custody of any remaining cemetery records plots or maps older cemeteries often have no remaining record of who is buried there if the gravestones are still extant and legible write down as much information as you can take digital photographs of each grave marker index them by full name surname first and give a copy to the local heritage historical society www usgenweb org and or local library if you want to be really fancy you can include gps coordinates too genealogists will thank you do some research on the internet in the local library or at www familysearch org and in government offices seek permission to restore the gravestones and other cemetery areas this task may be performed either before or after you have formed a team to help with the restoration sometimes permission can be the impetus for forming a group of devoted restorers sometimes having the restoration team in place is the only motivation that will put in train the ability to get a permission for restoration play it by ear and do some preliminary homework as to logistics of permission and team formation first form a restoration team the team s task will be to voluntarily restore the graves gravestones and any other relevant cemetery features to their former glory some of the sources from which you may be able to draw interested persons include place of worship the congregation of a place of worship attached to a neglected cemetery may be interested in forming a restoration team contributing members or even funds historical and cultural societies museum groups local residents organizations school groups and youth groups outline your restoration project to the relevant clubs places of worship societies etc in each case you will need to talk the to those in charge of groups although an in depth restoration plan is best left to the restoration team and its own brainstorming meetings you will need a blueprint to show others and convince them why the cemetery should be restored keep it short and persuasive in tone emphasize the historical cultural faith and community benefits of loving restoration of our human past ascertain the level of decay and the type of work that needs to be done this is about drawing up a plan the plan must include assessment of the problems and things that need to be fixed assessment of the costs to do restorative work potential funding sources government events raffles donations collections etc responsibilities for managing the restoration team any legal and insurance issues and its finances hint keep this as simple as possible and ask for pro bono legal and financial advice meeting dates for discussion regular dates for restoration work including that most mundane of needs feeding the volunteer helpers seek government and municipal grants for restorative work many heritage and restoration grants are offered by government and local government look at websites for national regional and local governments in the areas of the arts heritage environmental restoration cultural and community services contact your local politicians for information and support find a drawcard this means finding something of interest in the cemetery that will give you media coverage and draw in more interest and donations to the cause ask these questions what is the cemetery known for do burials in the cemetery reflect a certain famous event in history for example deaths by disease during transportation to the colonies deaths by a virulent flu ravaging a country deaths from a shipwreck etc is the cemetery neglected because of language or cultural changes for instance in quebec canada many english graveyards in the eastern townships have been neglected as the social balance changes to more french speaking inhabitants than english speaking inhabitants is there one famous infamous or relatively important burial in the cemetery direct the restoration team set specific tasks for the team such as restoring fallen over headstones restoring misplaced headstones mending broken gravestones and statues remarking the borders around graves polishing gravestones weeding and replanting moss and lichen removal unless your group considers this to add a pleasant touch general tidy up hold an unveiling ceremony when the restoration team has completed its restoration task hold an event that will attract locals history buffs the curious and the media have a commemorative plaque made for unveiling that specifies the reason for the restoration the name of the restoration team the date and any other pertinent details send out press releases to the media have snacks drinks and music on hand to make this a real social occasion ask the local mayor or some other local dignitary to give a speech maintain the restoration team do not disband when the restoration is complete continue to tend the cemetery continue to hold events to attract funding and to maintain interest in the site post information online to attract history buffs and link this with the local community s tourism industry heritage tourism is a fast growing industry and restored cemeteries are a definite part of such touristic

the cemetery you also should photograph all the physical features and note the control number of that feature on each photograph so the photos can be organized using the map note the condition of each feature and the work that must be done to repair or restore it once your map is complete you can divide the cemetery into zones and plan your preservation efforts accordingly the map allows you to

protect the safety of your volunteers by establishing rules of conduct and keeping a first aid kit on hand at all times if anyone is injured while working at the cemetery take note of any toxic plants such as poison oak on the grounds and make sure anyone with responsibility for clearing brush in those areas wears protective clothing where possible have professionals train volunteers so everyone working has an understanding of what constitutes brush or debris that should be removed and what stones or other material is a part of the natural order of the cemetery s design and shouldn t be disturbed mow around markers after the brush is cleared the bulk of the grass in a cemetery can be mowed using a hand mower although care should be taken to first flag the markers and not mow over them 22 x research source if you hire a landscape company or other contractors to complete mowing make sure they understand the delicate nature of the site and are willing to take precautions to avoid upsetting historic markers or destroying landscape features any agreements with landscapers or outside contracts should be in writing so everyone understands the nature of the project use push mowers rather than riding mowers if possible non motorized mowers are preferable as they create the least disturbance and lower the risk of damaging historic artifacts and grave markers avoid using pesticides herbicides or fertilizers chemicals can upset the balance of delicate cemetery soils and cause further erosion of old markers particularly if they are made of porous stones such as limestone 23 x research source if toxic plants need to be cleared consult a plant or landscape professional on methods to remove unwanted plants without harming other vegetation keep in mind that some plants and vegetation may have cultural significance the basic makeup of the historic cemetery s landscape should be kept intact as much as possible check the soundness of grave markers before you

for detailed questions children may have questions that you didn t expect such as what s it like inside a coffin or whether it dark and cold under the ground these questions aren t intended to be disrespectful but reflect a child s attention towards the concrete answer each question as best you can if you don t know the answer to your child s question you should say so if there s a way to find out the answer through research you and your child can engage in the research together your child s questions might be less abstract and philosophical than they first appear for example a child asking about where the dead person is now might not need a lengthy explanation of the afterlife but simply need to be reassured that the body is buried in the cemetery 7 x research source because your child is unlikely to sit and talk with you for a long time be alert for these questions to pop up in other contexts encourage your child to express his feelings children may express their feelings

about something if you re able to show your emotions your child will learn that even difficult feelings are okay 13 x research source healthy grieving involves balancing internal processing of feelings paired with coping within your day to day life it s a good idea to model gentleness with your own feelings as well as those of your child recognize that there s no right way to grieve

you you can also reassure your child by telling them that most people live for a very long time before they die and that it was not their fault that grandma died when you explain death you can say i have some sad news grandma died today her heart stopped beating she does not breath in and out anymore she cannot eat see hear or move she cannot feel pain or be hurt either it is different from sleeping because all your body parts still work when you are sleeping but grandma s body parts have stopped working 5 x research source discuss your cultural beliefs you can also reassure your child by discussing your cultural beliefs about life death and the afterlife your child will most likely ask where the deceased person is going and what will happen with their body the best answer is to say

the afterlife you can tell your child that these things are a mystery if you re uncomfortable talking with your child about what happened to the deceased s body you can always refer your child to someone they trust for example they might talk to a family member or a relative or someone with professional experience like a clergy member or a member of the hospice staff it is important to try to answer all their questions and answer them in simple terms they may repeat the questions they don t fully understand the answers to this is normal try to avoid euphemisms like sleep or went away these euphemisms might confuse children and cause them unnecessary fear for example a child may be afraid of sleeping or taking naps if you equate death with sleeping or they might develop anxiety around separation if they are told that someone went away when they died it is also problematic to tell your child that someone died because of a sickness your child does not fully comprehend the difference between a serious illness like cancer and a temporary sickness like a sore throat reassure your child by saying only very very serious illnesses may cause death everyone gets sick but we usually get better again remember when mommy had a stomach ache and got better again be honest and don t hide your feelings remember to be honest about the situation and your feelings don t try to hide your feelings from your child showing and verbalizing your own pain gives your child an example to follow holding back your feelings might give the impression that your child should repress their feelings

cry don t worry i will take care of you on the other hand it may take your child a minute to process the information and they might not respond right away this is ok let them process the information

time for friends and family to come together to say thank you goodbye and i love you to the person who has died tell them that it is a time to remember and to pay their last respects to the person

bed with a little pillow your grandma s body will be dressed up in a pretty outfit and will be lying in the special box there will be flowers and pictures around the box 8 x research source arrange a visit beforehand to prepare your child you can arrange a visit to the funeral home beforehand you can show them the room where the casket will be and where the bathroom and the playground is explain

will gather around the grave a special hole that is a dug in the ground to say prayers and to place flowers on the casket explain cremation if the body will be cremated children may be curious and concerned about the body if it has become ashes be sure to reassure your child that this process is not painful try not to use the word burn since that word suggests pain you might discuss cremation as a beautiful process that helps the body turn back into ashes in order for it to become a part of the earth for example there is a special place called the crematorium the crematorium has a special room not like any room in our house with a special fire the fire is very very hot and will turn your grandma s body into ashes she will not feel any heat or pain her ashes will be put in a pretty container called an urn the urn will be at the funeral 9 x research source consider what a child s grieving process is like children go through grief in a way that is different from adults and

say to them also inform your child about what others might tell them tell them that others might say don t cry be brave be strong or be extra nice to your parents now therefore they can get conflicting messages however let them know that is ok to feel whatever it is they feel that it is ok to cry try to help your child understand that people cope with death differently and that people are raised to deal with death differently explain to them that what those people were taught about death when they were young is different from what you are teaching them about it now 13 x research source don t force them to attend if your child does not want to attend the funeral do not force them to if you see that your child is feeling sad or worried ask them about their feelings and listen

someone dies try to be willing to talk about these issues with your child children may want to know about physical changes that happen to a dead body they may also want to know what happens to a person after they die talk about these issues within any religious frameworks that you believe help children understand that death is a normal part of life for example say death will happen to

lessen the impact with metaphors or fluffy language be prepared for questions about the event make sure the school staff has all the facts straight and is aware of what is going to be shared let the parents know when you are going to talk to the classes they may want to be present with their children give the students positive ways to channel their grief help the students work through their grief by helping them channel their feelings into positive actions this can help give the child or teen closure and help them come to a place where they can move on 14 x research source for example let the children release balloons plant trees collect money for a bench or make a memory book for the deceased classmate s family organize a school activities that help the community in honor of the deceased schoolmate have a bake sale to raise money for charity and donate it in honor of the child be available to students when a student dies it affects the entire school the students may not know they can be open with their feelings try to foster an environment of acceptance where students feel safe expressing their feelings and asking questions talk honestly about your feelings so your students may decide to open up about their own feelings and address their grief tell your students if anyone would like to talk in a safe environment where you won t be judged feel free to come talk to me be around for the students in case they need to talk they may not feel safe talking to parents so provide an open safe environment for them to talk about their feelings confusion and questions it will

that all they have to do is tell you and you will get them the help they need immediately say you don t have to worry about being like robby because i m here to talk if you ever feel sad or like things are too hard just come tell me and i ll get you some help use active listening 8 x research source throughout the exchange it s important to keep the lines of communication open by showing that

he or she does not have many food restrictions talk about something nice you can have for breakfast or lunch if there are food restrictions mention the sunday comic strips from the newspaper or something like that if you don t live together set a date for your next visit and make sure that date is not too far away do more of what the dying person enjoys not what you enjoy if he or she likes music you hate let them listen to it if he or she loves a certain book or poem read it to them finish the dying person s bucket list if he she has a bucket list or wish list help them get their wishes

most perfect moment to be honest and just be true to your feelings share just how much that person means to you talk about your favorite memories or the strengths you developed because of him or her

people in the receiving line depending on the type of wake it is the casket holding the deceased person may be present if so you ll usually start your visit by entering the line to stop at the casket be subdued but not somber you can chat with the people near you since that s a key part of what wakes are for 3 x research source simple small talk is fine hi i m jan and i work with albert s grandson chad i didn t know albert well but i know from chad what a caring and fun loving person he was pay your respects to the deceased if the casket is present if you wish you can kneel down to pray at the

about the deceased others will remain more solemn in nature get a feel for the room before you begin to mingle with family members and other attendees 5 x research source take your cues mainly from the people you know especially if they were close to the deceased if they are smiling and laughing you can as well but respectfully if they re crying be a source of consolation and comfort give the

lines of it s for the best they re in a better place i know how you re feeling at least they re no longer in pain only the good die young or it will get easier over time don t tell them how to feel instead praise the deceased if you knew them at all or just offer your support instead say something simple and supportive like i feel fortunate to have known mark i am sorry for your loss listen attentively and sympathetically wakes like funerals are for the living not the dead while bereaved loved ones are sometimes quiet and reflective often they are eager to talk quite a bit about the deceased never force them to talk but if they do want to listen and pay attention to them 7 x research source especially when you don t know the deceased well enough to add many memories or reflections yourself your job is to be a sympathetic ear and perhaps a shoulder to cry on share pleasant memories or just pleasantries with other attendees after you ve offered your sympathies to the close family you can look around for other people you may know even if you don t recognize anyone else feel free to introduce yourself and chat for a bit talk fondly about the deceased if you knew them well enough to do so or just listen to their stories and smile 8 x research source there may be photos or a slideshow with pictures of the deceased during happier times if so you can look at these with others and say hey i remember that or bob always had such a great sense of humor or wow i ll really miss those monday night football games over at larry s place wakes are for reminiscing and remembering the good times you may be asked how you knew the deceased by other attendees keep your answer simple like we volunteered at the same organization he was a great team leader dress conservatively in subdued colors you don t have to wear black but this also isn t the time to wear the wildest brightest thing you own blacks greys browns tans and muted blues are all acceptable in terms of types of outfits think of what you might wear to a wedding but with an even more muted color palette everything should be clean pressed and simple shoes should not be athletic shoes sandals or very high heels these rules apply to children too 9 x research source as with weddings you don t want seem like you re upstaging the star of the proceedings with a bright or outrageous outfit avoid neon colors or bright reds yellows and oranges likewise avoid clothing with cheery prints like flowers or bold patterns likewise it would be rude to go causal and wear jeans arrive at your convenience but with the bereaved in mind wakes often last several hours so that everyone gets a chance to stop in only close loved ones tend to stay the whole time so you don t need to plan to be there for hours at the same time though it s disrespectful to be in a rush to leave 10 x research source if you are going there to support a bereaved friend or colleague think about or just ask when they might need you there the most you might even offer to help set up beforehand or close up at the end enter the wake venue quietly and soberly wakes usually aren t as somber as funerals but that doesn t mean you

distractions then politely thank any greeters or anyone who opens the door for you 11 x research source the goal is to be inconspicuous you want the bereaved to notice your presence on their time instead of announcing your own arrival through your words actions or attitude sign the guest book if one is provided some wakes will have guestbooks and some won t if there is one it will usually be located right by the entrance take a quick moment to sign it and especially if you don t know many people there add a small note of how you knew the deceased or know the bereaved 12 x research source depart quietly when you feel the time is right after you have finished spending time with other attendees you may proceed to make a quiet exit unless you feel it would be disruptive to do so quietly mention to one of the bereaved that you re leaving offer a final consolation or just a polite goodbye 13 x research source say something like it was an honor to attend and please once again accept my condolences for your loss please give me a call if i can be of any help good evening if it feels right to do so you can also go up to the casket for a final goodbye don t assume that you need to be invited wakes typically are open to anyone who knew the deceased even just a little or who is just close to some of the bereaved keep a lookout for information in published obituaries or ask someone you know well for details on the wake 14 x research source wakes however can vary by tradition some are smaller affairs while some resemble large parties if you re not sure ask someone you know go if doing so will bring comfort to the bereaved will it bring a quick smile to someone s face to see you there will they be eager to share a story or two about the deceased with you don t feel like it is disrespectful to the deceased to show up at their wake when you hardly knew them instead remember that it shows respect to be there as a comforting presence for the deceased s loved ones 15 x research

something dies or do you remember the dead flower why do you think it died preschool children generally see death as reversible and temporary because they have no concept of permanence or experience with death to give them context children of this age are in what piaget has called the pre operational stage of development 3 x research source during this time children may have a hard time with abstract concepts in general such as death by the time children are between the ages of 5 and 9 they come to understand death as more permanent and absolute however they usually do not relate it to themselves 4 x research source from the age of nine and through adolescence children begin to fully comprehend the meaning of death particularly the idea that they too will die someday explain what

you you can also reassure your child by telling them that most people live for a very long time before they die and that it was not their fault that grandma died when you explain death you can say i have some sad news grandma died today her heart stopped beating she does not breath in and out anymore she cannot eat see hear or move she cannot feel pain or be hurt either it is different from

concerned about the body if it has become ashes be sure to reassure your child that this process is not painful try not to use the word burn since that word suggests pain you might discuss cremation as a beautiful process that helps the body turn back into ashes in order for it to become a part of the earth for example there is a special place called the crematorium the crematorium has a special room not like any room in our house with a special fire the fire is very very hot and will turn your grandma s body into ashes she will not feel any heat or pain her ashes will be put in a pretty container called an urn the urn will be at the funeral 9 x research source consider what a child s grieving process is like children go through grief in a way that is different from adults and

better about not knowing or understanding everything 11 x research source if you don t know an answer to a question you can say i m not sure myself about that or i don t know the answer to that

say to them also inform your child about what others might tell them tell them that others might say don t cry be brave be strong or be extra nice to your parents now therefore they can get conflicting messages however let them know that is ok to feel whatever it is they feel that it is ok to cry try to help your child understand that people cope with death differently and that people are raised to deal with death differently explain to them that what those people were taught about death when they were young is different from what you are teaching them about it now 13 x research source don t force them to attend if your child does not want to attend the funeral do not force them to if you see that your child is feeling sad or worried ask them about their feelings and listen provide them comfort by hugging them and by telling them to not worry and that everything will be ok after a few minutes of talking and listening do a fun activity together that will lighten their

how to pick music for a funeral,though a funeral is a time of mourning it is also a time to commemorate and celebrate the life of someone who has passed as such the ceremony should convey who the deceased was what was important in their life and how others felt about them a good way to do this is through the song choices every piece should be carefully chosen to express their beliefs and personality,take the venue into account if the memorial service is going to take place at a funeral home you will be able to play almost any music that you like however if the service will be held at a religious establishment like a church then you may be held to the traditions and restrictions of that religion be sure to consult with a clergy member to discuss any possible rules in regards to music 1 x research source even if you can t play particular songs during a service you may be able to play them while people are entering exiting decide if you will use recorded or live music though

whatever musicians participate in regular services for example many churches employ choirs and guitarists 2 x research source if you are going through a funeral home check with the service director for what music they have on hand many funeral homes have a large collection of music from varying genres ask a friend or family member to sing though it can be difficult and emotional asking a family member or close friend of the departed to sing can add a deeper sense of intimacy to a funeral however be sure to double check with whoever you ask as this can be quite a sensitive undertaking you don t want them to be unable to perform or feel overly pressured because you asked try something like hey sarah i was wondering if you would want to sing at mary s service i know this is a difficult time so please don t feel pressured to say yes i just know the two of you were close and she always appreciated your voice look at the music the deceased enjoyed a funeral is both a memorial and a celebration of the life of someone who has passed as such it s important to choose music that reflects who they are for example if they had a favorite song or artist try considering these options

deceased not only will these people have a good idea of what the departed listened to and enjoyed they will also be able to contribute ideas for example they can tell you about special songs that reflect moments of the deceased s life perhaps a song linked to a shared childhood memory or a significant family moment try approaching them in a private moment and saying hey i m trying to put together some meaningful songs for mary s service is there anything special you know she wanted or that you would like search funeral songs on the internet if you are still having trouble after

also try sticking to instrumentals between readings 3 x research source ask other family members or close friends of the deceased for their opinion they can help you put together a list to try and narrow things down you can also ask the funeral home or a clergy member for what is typically played and when they should also give you a good idea of how many songs you need for the service review

if a favorite of the deceased are not acceptable for a funeral service songs with copious swearing or dark lyrics are likely to make guests uncomfortable some standard funeral songs with good lyrics are louis armstrong s what a wonderful world or michael crawford s one eagle wings put everything together after you ve chosen your songs and decided on a setlist try to get all of the music together if you are going to use music directly from the funeral home make sure you pick up the cds as soon as you can if you are using your own music then burning a cd of your own transferring songs to a usb drive or putting songs into a playlist on a music player like itunes is a good idea you don t want to get to the service and realize you ve forgotten something having everything altogether will also

fault 4 x research source save things that remind you of your loved one just because a person or a pet is gone doesn t mean you shouldn t always remember them it may be comforting to know that even if

will always be a part of you some mementos will always be worth keeping to remind you of your own courage tenacity and ability to envision a better future keep the mementos that remind you of the person or pet in a box somewhere out of the way bring them out when you need a tangible reminder of your memories it s not usually a good idea to leave the mementos lying around in the open a constant reminder that someone is gone can make it hard to move on get help in our society we have a tremendously harmful stigma against people who seek help with emotional problems seeing a therapist or counselor does not make you weak or pathetic rather it s a sign of strength by seeking out the help you need you show an admirable desire to move forward and overcome your grief don t hesitate to schedule an appointment with a professional in 2004 more than a quarter of american adults had seen a therapist within the previous two years shift the focus away from sadness try to remember the good times and the best memories you shared with the person or pet you ve lost focusing on negative thoughts or regrets won t change what has happened it will just make you feel worse be assured that no one who has brought you happiness would ever want you to wallow in sadness try to remember things like the way this person talked the small quirky mannerisms the times that you spent laughing together and the things this person has taught you about life and yourself if you ve lost a pet remember the beautiful times you spent together the happy life you gave your pet and the special traits your pet had every time you feel tempted to become even more sad angry or self pitying grab a diary and write down the good things you can remember about the person or pet that has been lost in moments of sadness you can consult this journal for a reminder of the happiness you had distract yourself by keeping busy and occupying yourself in tasks that require a dedicated focus you give yourself a break from constantly ruminating over the loss this also gives you the space to realize that there are still good things about your world while work or studies can provide some relief from the constant thoughts about loss don t simply rely on your routine to distract yourself or you risk feeling that there is only work and sorrow and nothing in between help reacquaint yourself with happier pursuits by doing something that gives you peace there are all sorts of possibilities such as gardening cooking fishing listening to your favorite music walking drawing painting writing etc choose whatever calms you and gives you a sense of joyful achievement not something everyday work or studies can always promise consider getting involved in social work shift your focus from your own problems to those of others consider volunteering as one possibility if you like children helping with young children who display lots of spontaneity and laughter may ease your mind 5 x research source find

through you marvel at the beauty of the trees and architecture you see let the hustle and bustle of life remind you that the world is beautiful life does go on you deserve to be a part of it and to eventually rejoin the daily routine there is some scientific evidence that suggests that sunlight has natural antidepressant properties 6 x research source getting out of the house may help you out of an emotional funk reclaim the idea of what you ve lost when you lose someone it s an unfortunate fact that you ll never enjoy his or her physical presence again however this doesn t mean that the person or pet you lost doesn t still exist in the world as an idea or a symbol know that the person or pet you ve lost lives on in your thoughts words and actions when we say do or think something that s influenced by the memory of someone who s gone s he lives on many religions teach that the soul or essence of a person remains after his or her physical body dies other religions teach that a person s essence is transformed into another form or redistributed into the earth if you re religious take solace in the fact that the person you have lost still exists in a spiritual sense spend time with good people it can be difficult to motivate yourself to get out and spend time with your friends after a loss however doing so can cause a noted improvement in your mood it s good to seek the company of friends who will be understanding of your emotional state even if you haven t recovered 100 find friends or acquaintances who are fun yet kind and sensitive they will help you ease back into your normal social role which in turn will help you stay occupied as you move on from your grief the first hangout session after a major loss can be a little subdued or awkward simply because your friends are worried about how to approach the subject don t let this get you down you had to make your re entrance to your normal social life at some point be persistent though it may take weeks or months for things to seem completely normal spending time with kind friends is almost always a good idea don t fake happiness as you re enter your normal routine you may feel that certain career and social situations require you to be happier than you actually are while you should try to avoid wallowing in grief you should also try to avoid forcing your own happiness forced happiness feels awful it s an absolute burden to wear a smile when you don t want to don t make happiness a chore it s alright to appear and act seriously in your social life and in your work provided you do nothing to hinder the happiness of others save your smile for when your happiness is genuine it will be so much sweeter allow time to heal time heals all wounds your emotional recovery may take months or years this is ok in due time you can eventually start honoring the person you lost through a renewed determination to enjoy your life to the fullest don t worry you won t ever forget those you ve loved nor will you misplace the internal strength that drove you to seek lost goals or achievements what may change is how you approach your life from this point there may be a sharpened focus a new sense of value or a totally changed perspective about certain aspects of your life this progress won t be possible however if you don t give yourself time to heal while you should give yourself adequate time to heal at the same time it s important to remember that your life is precious and that you re responsible for making the most of your time here the purpose of your life is to be happy not sad don t rush away from grief but don t be content with a partial recovery make your journey to recovery one of gradual improvement you owe it to yourself keep moving forward no matter how long it takes don t second guess your happiness don t feel bad for feeling good there s no set length of time for recovering from a loss if you regain your happiness sooner rather than later don t feel guilty for not grieving enough if you feel like you ve recovered from a loss you probably have don t set deadlines on grieving but don t postpone your happiness either never force yourself to be sadder than you need to be,Family-Life
how to cope with grief,grief can be caused by a variety of factors from the loss of a loved one or a pet to the loss or failure of a cherished dream anyone can agree that coping with grief is a difficult and complicated process and that there s no convenient timeline you can follow to truly get over your grief still if you manage your emotions to the best of your ability get help and support and remember to take care of yourself you can slowly start to feel better,don t ignore your grief one myth people may have about facing grief is that if you ignore your feelings or sweep them under the rug that they will simply go away sure you can go on with your life go to work and act like nothing happened but in the long run this is only going to delay your pain and make you drag out all of the sad bitter angry or hurt feelings that are welling up somewhere inside you so the first thing you should do is admit that you re in terrible pain admit it to yourself to your friends and to your support network and then take it from there question yourself many times it is seen that the reason for grief is illogical and irrational for example some people grieve because of a habit of doing so as after when they are get over grief they feel better and triumphant they even sometimes get addicted to this triumphant feeling after getting over their grief so question yourself is this grief rational or logical people sometimes grieve for something over which they have no control of petty things fake reasons etc for example if a friend fails a test logically you have no control or influence over their friend s failure but still they will grief instead of supporting their friend in a productive way another example could be rejection in an interpersonal relationship which is most of the time is complete nonsense remember failure is a part of success is this reaction productive ask yourself the grief you are feeling is it in anyway going to help me to get over the source for the grief would it have a positive effect on my life if yes by all means grieve but if no aren t you being irrational and hard on yourself you are feeling miserable which is not going to get you anywhere can i do something about the grief people sit there and grieve in a hope to get rescued and in the end it makes them even more sad and grievous instead of feeling miserable ask yourself what can i do to fix it if there is something which you can do about it try to do it however if there is nothing you can do to fix this it would be irrational and you would be doing a huge disservice to yourself by feeling sad over which you have no control of don t force yourself to be strong another thing people going through a great loss tell themselves is that they should put up a strong front you may think that nobody wants to see you crying looking sad being barely able to take care of yourself and just walking around like a sleepwalker but it s okay to do that if that s really how you re feeling if you have to stay strong for other friends or family members then it can get tricky but you can still admit that you re feeling weak if you re really devastated of course you don t want to completely fall apart and you may not have to but don t try to act tough or like you ve got it all under control when you know that s not the case cry if you want to there s no limit to how many tears a person can cry before they cease to be productive if you feel like crying just get it all out of your system and cry again whenever you feel like it obviously it s more convenient if you can cry mostly when you re not alone and not fall victim to tears in public but if you do it s not the end of the world and people will understand don t think that your tears are slowing you down or keeping you from moving forward 1 x research source don t cry if you don t want to contrary to popular belief not everybody experiences pain the same way and not through tears you can feel a deep sadness

not what you want to do 2 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source stop thinking about a timeline maybe you ve heard that grief only lasts a year that doesn t sound so bad right unfortunately everyone has his or her own timeline when it comes to dealing with grief and you shouldn t feel

you can be totally honest since you don t have to show this part to anyone else identify your favorite words and phrases read through your notes whether it s a list a formal letter or something else entirely this is the raw material of your poem and you ll need to mine these notes for the pieces that will make up your poem circle underline or highlight the words and phrases you choose you may want to choose words based on the associations you ve made in your mind the relevance of those words to the deceased s life or the poetic nature of those words come up with some strong imagery as you review your favorite words and phrases you should begin to visualize some strong images consider the sights smells sounds tastes and physical sensations that come to mind as you read through your favorite words and phrases 1 x research source choose concrete words and phrases which describe things using the senses instead of abstract ones which refer to feelings or concepts concrete words help the images take shape in the reader s mind an example of an abstract description would be the grass was tired a concrete description would be something like the blades of grass bent over leaning for a lifetime against the prairie wind try to paint an image with your words think about abstract original ways of phrasing things and vivid descriptive phrases that capture the words you identified as your favorites from the earlier notes one way to paint a picture with words is to try to describe the most striking images you see for example you might describe the deceased person s hands then zoom out to what they re holding then describe the way the deceased used to perform that action decide how you want to organize your thoughts the ultimate shape you want your poem to take will influence how you organize your thoughts and begin drafting your poem now that you ve put all your raw thoughts and feelings on paper and made imagistic phrases from your favorite words you ll need to figure out how you envision your poem taking shape 2 x research source do you want your poem to capture a particular moment between you and the deceased or perhaps a general moment in the life of the deceased your poem could also capture a conversation you and the deceased had or it could be a response to something the deceased said to you you could use your poem to simply describe the characteristics of the deceased choose a poetic form before you begin actually writing your poem you may want to consider what form you d like the poem to take there are many poetic forms and no one form is necessarily better or worse than any other form which form you choose will depend on the aesthetic style that most appeals to you 3 x research source common forms of poetry include but are not limited to abstract poetry plays with different sounds and rhythms to evoke different emotions elegy poem of mourning sorrow haiku japanese poetic form that is restricted to three lines containing five syllables in the first line seven syllables in the second line and five syllables in the third line sonnet 14 line poem written in iambic pentameter sestina poetic form that plays with using six words rotated as the ending word of each line throughout the poem begin the poem with your strongest image opening the poem with a vivid image will grab the attention of your audience and set the tone for the rest of your poem 4 x research source think about which image or images are most important to you or most accurately capture the overall feeling or mode you hope to capture in the poem 5 x research source you can get a pretty good idea of your strongest image by identifying the one that always comes to mind when you reflect on your list if you re not sure which image is your strongest try asking a friend or relative which image stands out the most in your poem compose the main idea of your poem many strong poems have one line that encapsulates the rest of the poem this key line may capture the feeling of the poem or it could be a line that explicitly states what the poem is all about 6 x research source consider what it is you re hoping to say about or to the deceased with this poem be creative obviously you miss the deceased but how can you make your poem an interesting and unique tribute to that person the main idea should involve the deceased but it can be about any aspect of their life or even a realization you ve had because of their passing rewrite any cliche phrasings a cliche is a phrase that is highly overused and comes across as unoriginal or uncreative cliches can easily ruin an otherwise exquisite poem as you read through your poem try to identify any phrases that sound like a stereotypical poetic phrase anything you feel like you ve heard before a million times then rewrite them an example of a cliche would be the sun sets on his life identify what the cliched phrase is trying to say brainstorm original ways to convey that information try using metaphors comparisons that don t use like or as to strengthen the poetic nature of your writing 7 x research source choose your favorite non cliche description and see how it fits with the rest of the poem a less cliched version of the above line might be he could no longer keep up with the orbit of the hours pair back on sentimentality while you are obviously dealing with a range of highly sentimental thoughts and feelings you want your poem to remain approachable to readers who may not share your memories of the deceased look back over your poem and try to identify places where you let your emotions take control of the poem then try rewriting those sections with a more even tone 8 x research source an example of a sentimental line might be i miss him so much look for any sections of the poem in which sadness grief or anguish completely dominate the poem ask yourself whether a reader who does not share your memories could understand or relate to those parts of the poem try rewriting those sections in a more controlled less emotional tone a less sentimental way of saying the above line might be i carry a million memories and all of them are his choose someone you can share your feelings with if you re sharing your poem with someone for the first time it may be easiest to choose someone with whom you feel comfortable a friend or family member may be ideal though you may also want to consider whether the individual you choose knew the deceased and can relate to how you re feeling 9 x research source make sure the person you choose will not be judgmental or rude when you share your poem consider choosing someone close to you who will be understanding and supportive decide whether to read your poem or show it some people feel more comfortable reading out loud while others may prefer showing a printed form of the poem to someone there is no right or wrong choice regarding how you share your poem it s simply a matter of what you re more comfortable with reading the poem out loud gives you the opportunity to voice the poem as you imagine it you can use inflections and pauses to emphasize certain parts which can t be done if someone is just reading the written words having someone else read the poem takes some of the pressure off of you to perform you don t have to worry about tearing up or getting emotional while you read but you lose the chance to voice the poem consider reading the poem at the service if you were close to the individual who passed away you may be asked to speak at his or her service if a service is held if you do decide to speak at the service reading your poem could be a moving tribute to the person you ve lost however your poem may be intensely personal and you may not feel comfortable sharing it at the service it s perfectly acceptable if you want to read your poem but there s nothing wrong with preferring to keep it private it s strictly a matter of personal preference and comfort,Family-Life

name where they lived and when they passed away you don t need to provide the cause of death if you don t want to keep the sentence brief and to the point so you can expand the obituary in other places 1 x research source for example you may write on the morning of june 10 2019 john smith of atlanta died at the age of 80 if you don t want to use the word died because it feels too blunt try

years in july 1980 he married jane doe and together raised two children anna and benjamin create a list of major points in your loved one s life on a separate sheet of paper so you have options to choose from avoid listing their mother s maiden name or your loved one s birthdate in the biography since identity thieves could steal the information and commit fraud 2 x research source add a short paragraph about hobbies passions or personal characteristics including personal details will capture the spirit of your loved one so others understand what their life was like create a list of hobbies or activities they actively participated in and how it affected other people 3 x research source for example you may say john was an avid car collector in spare time when he wasn t working at his restaurant he would restore classic cars and show them at car shows he was known for his good sense of humor and his contagious laughter among his friends you don t need to include this section if you don t have the space for it in your obituary list close family members in the third paragraph mention close family members such as immediate family and parents by name when you want to list extended family use a collective phrase or list the specific number for others that have passed away before your loved one use the phrase preceded in death by and use survived by before listing any relatives still living 4 x research source for example you may write john is preceded in death by his father tom and his mother jill he is survived by his wife jane his 2 children anna and benjamin and several cousins nieces and nephews provide details about the memorial and funeral service if it s public if you re holding a public service list the time and date along with the name of the funeral home make sure to list the specific details so others who were close to your loved one know where to go for example you could write a public memorial service will be held at 11 30 am on june 13th 2019 at the church of christ you do not have to provide any information if there is not a public service read the obituary out loud to catch any errors carefully read the obituary after you ve written it to see if there are any sentence or spelling errors talk through the entire obituary slowly to catch any phrases that are worded incorrectly or read awkwardly note your changes with a pen or pencil so you know to go back and change them 5 x research source if you wrote your paper on a computer print it out so you can easily mark up the page with what you need to change have a friend or family member read it to check for missed information give the obituary you ve written to a close relative so they can see if they have anything to add or would like to remove write down any suggestions they have and try to work them into a new copy of the obituary 6 x research source talk to multiple people that were close to your loved one to see if they have any stories or details they think should be included compare your obituary to other obituaries in the paper read through the current obituaries for the paper you re planning on submitting to look at their structure to see if you need to change anything about the obituary you ve written 7 x research source obituaries don t need to look exactly the same but they should contain all the important information necessary look on your local paper s website to see how to submit an obituary many papers accept obituaries through a web portal or by email look up the website for your local paper to see how they accept their submissions and what files you need to include plan on submitting the obituary 2 3 days before the service is held so others can make travel arrangements to get there 8 x research source provide a photo of the deceased if you want choose a happy photo of your loved one so other people recognize that they lived a good life check with the newspaper where you plan on submitting to see if they have any size requirements for the photo you plan on submitting 9 x research source some newspapers charge an additional fee to publish pictures check with the paper s obituary requirements to see submit your obituary before the print deadline if you want it in the paper many newspapers have a print deadline of about 5 30 pm check with the paper you re submitting to so you know the exact deadline for when you need the

subscription to find a death notice,check the online social security death index the ssdi includes the record of anyone with a u s social security number whose death was reported to the social security administration 1 x research source websites such as genealogybank com and ancestry com allow you to access portions of the ssdi free of charge you can search the ssdi by the person s first and last name date of birth date of death last known residence social security number or any combination thereof 2 x research source if you have limited information about the person for whom you need a death notice you can use the information in the ssdi to fill in the blanks for example if you are looking for the death notice for your great great grandmother and you know her first and last name but not exactly when or where she died you may be able to find a listing in the ssdi that would provide you with that information once you know when and where she died you have a better idea of where else to look to find her death notice search for city or state death records databases many larger cities and some states have online databases available for use by the general public state death indexes typically go back further in time than the ssdi so if you re looking for the death notice of someone who died in the 1700s for example you d be more likely to find the information at the state level although some of these indexes are available online for free those databases typically only cover deaths through the early 1900s if you re looking for an older death you may have to pay a one time fee or join a subscription site to gain access to the records 3 x research source look for newspaper obituaries depending on your purpose a newspaper obituary may be all you need to get details of a person s death keep in mind that for most people the write up in the paper is the official death notice the death notice generally gives a brief story of the person s life and lists their surviving family members and the arrangements made newspaper staff writers typically create obituaries only for famous or significant people 4 x research source in small towns the newspaper may include more staff written obituaries you also might find obituaries or reprints of the death notice in church or community newsletters 5 x research source if someone lived most of their life in one place but died in another their hometown often will reprint the death notice so if you re not sure exactly where the person died but you know where they were born and grew up try checking the newspapers there some newspapers publish their archives online while others make their obituaries available on websites such as legacy com 6 x research source several websites such as obitsforlife com offer a searchable database of funeral home death notices which for most people would be the notice published in the local newspaper some of these websites allow you to search for free but require you to pay a fee or sign up for a subscription service before they grant you access to the records 7 x research source go to the public library local libraries typically archive materials such as local newspapers that you may not be able to find anywhere else the main branch of your local library typically has the entire archives of the local newspaper from the date of the first issue usually on microfilm or microfiche for example the new york public library has microform copies of the new york times beginning with issues from 1857 unfortunately many of these microform collections are not searchable the way an online database would be but if you know the approximate date of the person s death you can scan through the newspapers until you find the published notice many local libraries also provide free access to databases such as newsbank which let you search newspaper obituaries and death notices nationwide these databases typically are only available with a paid subscription but library subscriptions enable patrons to enjoy free access 8 x research source look for cemetery or burial records if you know where the person was buried you may be able to find a listing in the cemetery s records that provides more information about the person s death cemetery records typically catalogue everyone buried there since gravestones can become weathered and illegible over time burial records can be particularly helpful if you know where the person is buried but can t find their grave although typically you have to visit the cemetery itself to view these records some districts now have their records available online for example you can use the orange county cemetery district s searchable database to find graves in anaheim cemetery el toro memorial park and santa ana cemetery 9 x research source visit your state archives facility if the person died in the united states you probably can find death notices and additional information by researching at the state archives keep in mind these facilities typically are located in the state s capital however if you re unable to travel to that city to review the documents in person you may be able to request them through the library of a local university or historical society 10 x research source state archives tend to have older records than social security or other national records and the records themselves may go into greater detail research at a national archives records center the national archives has a network of research facilities across the country that have federal records and other resources available for example ancestry com and other such services are available free of charge on computers at archives facilities 11 x research source you may be able to find records on those services that you wouldn t otherwise be able to access without paying for a subscription you can find the location you need on the national archives website at http www archives gov locations the directory lists the address of each facility along with the particular services offered there if you re looking for the death notice of a person who was in the military or who died overseas you can most likely find something in the national archives 12 x research source determine whether you need a certified or informational copy although most states make informational copies of death certificates available to anyone who asks certified copies typically are restricted to close family members of the deceased the death certificate typically is prepared by the funeral home or other individual or organization in charge of the person s remains in addition to the date time place and cause of death the death certificate includes information such as the person s full name and address his or her birth date and birthplace and the name and birthplace of the person s mother and father 13 x research source the death certificate also may include information about the person s education military experience marital status and the name of the surviving spouse 14 x research source because of the sensitivity of much of the information on the death certificate many states restrict access to them if you are unrelated to the person for whom you re seeking a death certificate you may only be able to get a redacted informational certificate particularly if the death was fairly recent 15 x research source certified copies are officially stamped and contain complete information these copies typically are required for functions involved with the person s estate such as transferring property or claiming death benefits 16 x research source however if you don t need the certificate for probate purposes an informational copy should be sufficient contact the appropriate state or county vital records department death certificates generally are kept in the state or county where the person died if the death occurred recently the record may not yet be at the state vital records department so you would need to go to the county however if it s been a year or longer you probably can find the certificate filed with the state 17 x research source conversely death records that are hundreds of years old typically are kept in local or county vital records offices rather than at the state level for example minnesota began keeping death records at the state level in 1908 for earlier death records you would have to contact the office in the county where the death occurred 18 x research source the cdc has an online directory of the vital records offices in each state at http www cdc gov nchs w2w htm fill out a request form most states have a particular form you must fill out to request either a certified or informational copy of the death certificate if you re requesting a certified copy you usually must be related to the person as defined by state law in most states certified copies are available for parents children and siblings of the deceased 19 x research source 20 x research source some jurisdictions require death records request forms to be signed in front of a notary staff at the vital records office will tell you if this is required or you may simply look on the form to see if there is a place for the form to be notarized 21 x research source if your request form must be notarized you can fill out the required information but don t sign it until you are in the presence of a notary you also may be required to submit documentation of your relationship to the deceased or your stated interest in the estate 22 x research source file your request form once you ve completed your request form you must file it with the state or county vital records office where you believe the death certificate to be located you must pay a fee for each copy of the death certificate the fee varies among jurisdictions but typically is between 10 and 15 23 x research source 24 x research source keep in mind that the fee is non refundable meaning you won t get any

people to handle money and raise your children if you die without leaving a will or a trust all core decisions about your child s care and inheritance fall into the control of the state,speak with your child s other parent the two of you should decide together who will be best to take on guardianship of your children and handle finances you should choose someone to be the physical guardian of your children as well as someone to handle your children s finances until they turn 18 this can be the same person but does not have to be you and the other parent should be on the same page about who should be selected as guardian however if you are divorced or not on good terms with your child s other parent you may not get them to agree with you about who should be the guardian generally if possible parents select a relative or close friend to be the guardian of their children if parents die unexpectedly it is likely that children will be most comfortable living with someone with whom they already have a close relationship such as a grandparent aunt or uncle consider the age health and location of potential guardians keep in mind that whoever you appoint as guardian must be someone who can properly care for your children consider the age health and location of the potential guardian for example if the guardian lives out of state keep in mind that the child will have to relocate and make new friends after the child has experienced the loss of a parent 1 x research source additionally consider the guardian s religion and lifestyle preferences you want to make sure that you choose someone who will raise your children how you want them to be raised 2 x research source generally you should choose a guardian that you see as responsible whatever that means to you personally act alone only if necessary if the other parent does not help you with raising your children you can act without them however be aware that if the other parent is alive it is possible that they may want to be named as guardian of your children should anything happen to you in most circumstances it is best for children to be raised by a parent but if you have reasons that you do not want the other parent to have custody of your children if something happens to you you need to name a different guardian document everything if deciding alone if you name a guardian without the input of your child s other parent it is possible that the other parent could challenge the guardianship should something happen to you if this happens the court will rely at least in part on your documentation regarding why you do not want the other parent to be the guardian therefore you should make sure that you provide detailed information about why you do not want the other parent to be named guardian reasons that the other parent should not be guardian include lack of a stable home for your children mental or physical problems that could impede your children s care alcohol or other substance abuse and physical abuse 3 x research source select the guardian the person who will have physical custody of your children is called the guardian of the person after weighing all of the options you will have to choose who you think would do the best job of raising your child or children even if you appoint a guardian in your will the court will not appoint the guardian unless doing so is in the best interests of the child so choose someone who is up to the task 4 x research source although the court might appoint someone different than the person named in your will the court will give your choice great consideration and will not go against that choice unless the guardian will be unable to properly take care of the child such that awarding guardianship would not be in the child s best interest if the person to whom you want to leave guardianship is your same sex partner include a letter to the court explaining how he or she is a better choice than a blood relation 5 x research source talk to the guardian before naming them in your will make sure that you speak with person that you want to name as the guardian of your child before you put them in your will the court will not force someone to serve as a guardian so make sure that the guardian is willing to serve before you formally name them if possible speak with the potential guardian in person and explain to them why you want them to raise your child in the event that something happens to you explain that they will have to provide certain information to the court including a criminal history before the court will appoint them formally as guardian the court may also require the guardian to go through an investigation usually an investigation doesn t mean that the guardianship is more likely to be denied or that the judge has seen red flags in some jurisdictions it is just the court s policy to investigate everyone because the judge is entrusting the guardian with raising the child he or she usually wants to check and make absolutely sure that the guardian is able to take the responsibility understand the responsibilities of the guardian of the estate the person who will have control over your child s finances and property is know as the guardian of the estate this person will make all decisions regarding your child s finances and property until your child is 18 6 x research source if you want you can appoint the same person as you appointed to be the guardian of the person to this position however you can also appoint someone else 7 x research source because managing finances and property does not require knowing the child well many people appoint an attorney or an accountant to be the guardian of the estate consider people you trust once a guardian of the estate is appointed that person

if you leave your house to your child with the instruction that he can never sell it do not have to be followed by the guardian regardless of what instructions you leave for the use of your child s assets the guardian has the duty to handle the assets in the best interests of your child which may include disregarding instructions aside from leaving any property to your children you do not need to put any other instructions in the will on how the property should be handled consider paying the guardian of the estate usually the guardian of the estate will spend time and resources handling your child s finances it is customary to pay the guardian of the estate for doing this however you do not need to specify how much the guardian should receive and you do not need to leave the guardian assets in the will all states have provisions in their probate codes regarding how much a guardian will be paid to look at the rules for your state check http estate findlaw com planning an estate state laws estates probate html ensure that the guardian of the estate has control over all assets assets such as life insurance policies are not passed in a will however the guardian of the estate

make sure that the guardian is in control of any life insurance accounts where your child is listed as the beneficiary unlike property that passes in a will your beneficiaries should receive money from the life insurance policy as soon as the company is informed of your death there is no probate process for a life insurance policy once the beneficiary receives the money the guardian has the power to take possession of the money and use it for the child s benefit if you need to add a child as a beneficiary or remove a child simply contact your life insurance policy and tell them that you

the wording of the deceased s will may prevent you from assigning your inheritance that is transferring it to an inheritance lender in exchange for an advance an easy choice would be the administrator in charge of the estate if they are an attorney in some cases geographical issues may complicate estate assignment for example estates held in other countries generally cannot be assigned however those held in different states are usually able to be assigned 2 x research source make sure you are receiving enough inheritance to qualify for an advance the amount required varies between lenders so check with several in your state to see if you are receiving enough for example a lender may require a minimum inheritance value of 17 000 3 x research source this amount is set to ensure that the advance is worth their trouble even though the amount inherited is considered inheritance advance lenders don t take your credit score into consideration so don t worry if you don t have stellar credit you will still get the advance if the rest of your information checks out 4 x research source consult with an attorney or financial professional before proceeding speak to the estate administrator or another legal or financial professional about the potential cost and tax consequences of your assignment your advance will result in your getting significantly less money than your inheritance would give you the professional you discuss this with can give you specific information on exactly how much less you will receive 5 x research source alert the estate attorney or the administrator for the person who passed away that you are getting an assignment call them as soon as you have decided to assign your inheritance this will allow them to properly allocate your

your inheritance and the deceased s estate the exact document required may vary between lenders to get started contact the estate administrator and request copies of the following documents an

lender is reputable 10 x research source make sure you are assigning your inheritance to the company and not taking out a loan backed by your inheritance in this type of agreement you are not technically taking out a loan but giving the lender the right to receive your inheritance in exchange for a lump sum payout right now this also transfers the risk of not receiving inheritance due to debts on the estate or other financial issues to the lender however the increased risk gives the lender the right to charge you more for your advance that is this allows them to give you less on your advance that the value of your inheritance 11 x research source fill out the loan application and submit the agreement should include a passage assigning the rights to your inheritance to the lender

when you will receive your advance wait the specified length of time and it should be mailed to you you are now free of having to wait for the probate court to release your inheritance check if you eligible for a family allowance in some case the administrator is required to provide an allowance for living expenses to dependents of the deceased this is generally only applicable to those who depended on the deceased for living expenses check with the estate administrator to investigate this allowance 13 x research source ask the estate administrator for an advance the estate administrator is qualified to give heirs of the estate advances on their inheritance if the estate can afford it however administrators are generally reluctant to do so because unexpected expenses or debts may arise if these unexpected costs did come up the administrator might be required to ask for the advance back from the recipient ask your estate administrator for this type of advance but be warned that they will likely say no 14 x research source make a claim on the estate another way to get money from the estate before it is released from probate is by making a claim on the estate this means that

how to determine inheritance if the intended beneficiary is deceased,when a person dies their estate is distributed to the beneficiaries named in their will but what happens if a beneficiary is dead first you need to find out when the beneficiary died because it takes a long time to probate an estate the beneficiary could have died before or after the death of the will maker depending on when the beneficiary died his or her estate could inherit the property if the decedent passes property outside of probate they will use trusts and beneficiary designation forms to pass property along because this area of state law is complicated you should consult with a qualified attorney if you have any questions,analyze when the beneficiary died the beneficiary might not inherit the property depending on when he died for example the will could state that the beneficiary must outlive the person who made the will for a certain amount of time e g 45 days 1 x research source the will can define this survivorship period you should check to see if the will does include a survivorship period your state law may also state a survivorship period even if the will does not if the beneficiary died outside this survivorship period then his or her estate will take the property for example a woman might have died in a car crash her state law might set a 45 day survivorship period her son who is the only beneficiary under her will might have died 100 days after his mother but before the estate property could be distributed in this situation the son s estate should inherit his mother s property however if the beneficiary did not outlive the survivorship period then you will need to look at alternate beneficiaries named in the will check if an alternate beneficiary was named some wills will name alternate beneficiaries in case the original beneficiary dies before the deceased in this situation the alternate gets the property 2 x research source check the will to see if an alternate was named the will might state i leave my entire estate to my wife lisa j jones if she does not survive me i leave my entire state to my son michael a jones 3 x research source there may even be a second level of alternates for example your will could say i leave my entire estate to my wife lisa j jones if she does not survive me i leave my entire estate to my son michael a jones if he does not survive me i leave my entire estate to my cousin abbey t smith find who inherits the residuary estate instead of naming an alternate some wills might state that if the beneficiary dies then the gift will pass to the beneficiary of the residuary estate the residuary is everything a person owns that isn t specifically given to other people 4 x research source read the will it should identify one or more people as beneficiaries for the residuary estate if the residuary beneficiary has died then an alternate might have been named typically however the residuary has multiple beneficiaries in this situation the other beneficiaries who are alive will continue to take the residuary estate and will divide the dead beneficiary s portion find your state s anti lapse statute historically if there was no alternate beneficiary then a gift would lapse when the beneficiary died to prevent this from happening every state but louisiana has passed anti lapse statutes 5 x research source the anti lapse statute states who will inherit the property in the event that the beneficiary is dead you should find your state s statute by searching for your state and anti lapse many states publish their probate laws online check if the deceased beneficiary was a relative most anti lapse statutes apply only to certain beneficiaries in general they don t apply to non relatives for example if you left money to a friend then the anti lapse statute doesn t kick in when your friend dies in this situation your state s anti lapse statute should state what happens to the gift usually the gift either falls into the residuary estate or goes to the deceased s heirs under your state s intestacy laws identify who inherits in the place of a related beneficiary the anti lapse statute does typically apply to grandparents or a direct descendant of a grandparent however the beneficiary must have left children because the children will usually inherit under the anti lapse statute 6 x research source for example if your sister was a beneficiary then her gift would pass to her children according to the anti lapse statute if your sister had no living children but her grandchildren were living then her grandchildren would inherit because they are her direct descendants however if your sister had no heirs then under most anti lapse statutes the gift fails the statute should state what happens the gift either falls into the residuary estate and is taken by the beneficiaries of the residuary estate or it passes according to intestacy laws read your state s intestacy laws let s say a gift was made with no alternate beneficiary it was also made to either a non relative or to a close relative who didn t leave children in this situation the state s anti lapse statute says the gift must pass to the will maker s heirs as if there were no will this is called intestacy 7 x research source your state will have rules on intestacy these rules will state who inherits the property when there is no will you can find your state s rules by searching the internet for your state and intestacy for example in illinois a surviving spouse will take the entire estate unless there are children in which case the children divide half of the estate equally and the surviving spouse gets half if there only children the children take the entire estate divided equally 8 x research source identify assets that are not subject to the probate process when the decedent dies with a will the process of verifying that will and distributing the estate s property is called probate in today s world a lot of people will avoid the probate process as much as possible by passing property to beneficiaries outside of probate to do this decedents will set up trusts and name people as transfer on death tod or payable on death pod beneficiaries 9 x research source different assets need to be set up differently to ensure they pass outside of probate and to the correct beneficiary if you are responsible for determining who gets a decedent s property you need to know what the decedent owned and how they wanted it distributed you will do this by looking at the legal documents that verify ownership and make distributions e g trust documents or bank account documents analyze trust documents one of the main ways people avoid probate is to set up a trust a trust is a legal document that sets aside someone s the grantor s property for the benefit of someone else the beneficiary 10 x research source the trust document will set out exactly how the property will be transferred when the grantor passes away in a detailed trust the grantor will make sure that contingency plans are in place in case a beneficiary passes away before they get any distributions if no beneficiary is alive when the grantor passes away the trust property may revert back to your estate to be distributed in the will s residuary clause common trust provisions you will see include language that gives the trust property to another named individual for example a trust might state that joe willis shall receive any cars i own upon my death if joe willis predeceases me my cars shall go to sally jones this type of provision is nice because it is straightforward and clear it is easy to see who takes the trust property if a beneficiary dies however this provision is not very flexible and will cause problems in situations where all named beneficiaries have predeceased the decedent distributions to groups of people for example a trust might indicate that my children shall receive income for life in this scenario the beneficiaries are one or more persons that have a specific relationship with the decedent if the decedent has three children and one passes away the other two will take the third child s share of the trust property track down the decedent s 401 k s and or iras when a decedent opens a 401 k or ira they will likely be asked to fill out a beneficiary designation form this form asks the decedent to name a beneficiary that will get the proceeds from these types of accounts when the decedent dies on the form itself the decedent will have an opportunity to name one or more primary beneficiaries as well as one or more contingent beneficiaries 11 x research source some accounts will call these pod and or tod beneficiaries for example assume the decedent named devan flaherty as their primary beneficiary in addition the decedent named mike jones and lisa ratner as contingent beneficiaries according to most beneficiary designation forms devan will receive the account s proceeds upon the decedent s death however if devann predeceases the decedent mike and lisa will share the proceeds from the decedent s account equally ask about life insurance policies sometimes the beneficiary for a life insurance policy dies either before the insured or before the entire policy has been paid out in this situation you need to see if anyone has been named as a co beneficiary read the life insurance policy generally if there are co beneficiaries then the remainder of the policy s benefits will be paid out to the remaining beneficiary co beneficiaries get paid at the same time and split the proceeds when one dies the other takes all of the remaining proceeds there may not be co beneficiaries however the policy could name a secondary beneficiary this person is like an alternate in a will he or she gets paid if the primary beneficiary dies for example someone might have named his wife as beneficiary and his daughter as a secondary beneficiary the daughter will get paid only if the mother dies before the insured 12 x research source if all possible beneficiaries have died then the life insurance proceeds will be paid to the insured s estate most likely in the decedent s residuary 13 x research source,Family-Life

how to create a will,when a person dies a probate court distributes his assets and debts according to the terms of his will if a deceased person does not have a will state inheritance laws dictate how his assets and debts are transferred to ensure that your assets and debts are distributed in the way that you would like them to be and not according to the distribution scheme set forth by your state you will need to create a valid will the requirements for creating a valid will vary from state to state and must be closely followed to guarantee that your property is transferred in the way that you intended,review your state s requirements for executing a valid will formal requirements for executing a valid will vary from state to state before you create a will you will need to review the requirements for your particular state to ensure that your will is enforceable upon your death generally a will must be 1 x research source in writing either handwritten or typed 2 x research source made by a person who is at least 18 years of age and able to understand the full meaning of the document 3 x research source signed by the testator person making the will and two witnesses 4 x research source determine whether your state follows community property or common law if you are married it is important that you determine whether you live in a community property or common law state before you write your will this distinction is important to ensuring that the terms of your will are carried out as you intended upon your death 5 x research source community property states include arizona california idaho nevada new mexico texas washington wisconsin and alaska all other states follow the common law in community property states all property acquired during a marriage known as marital property is divided equally between the spouses upon his death each spouse can dispose of his one half share of marital property however he wishes however he may not give away his spouse s share of marital property this means that if a wife writes a will bequeathing her entire estate to her daughter one half of her estate will automatically be given to her husband instead regardless of the terms of her will the only way to avoid this outcome is by agreeing to a different arrangement with your spouse in a prenuptial agreement in common law states a surviving spouse is not entitled to a one half interest in all property acquired during marriage however common law states still protect a surviving spouse from complete disinheritance usually by guaranteeing that he receive at least one third of the deceased spouse s property just as in community property states this outcome can be overcome by entering a prenuptial agreement that sets forth a different arrangement enter a prenuptial agreement if you wish to ensure that your spouse receives less than one half or one third of your estate depending on the exact proportion mandated by the law in your state you will need to enter a prenuptial contract in which you agree to a different arrangement 6 x research source write a contract that specifies what each spouse is entitled to receive upon death to be valid both parties must voluntarily agree to the contract fully disclose their situations at the time the contract is executed and sign the contract before a public notary in addition the agreement must be fair to both parties 7 x research source keep in mind that even if you write a prenuptial agreement specifying the share of your estate that will pass to your spouse upon your death you will still need to a will that outlines the remaining distribution of your estate review which assets if any you have in a trust if you have made a trust designating a beneficiary to receive property upon your death you will need to review this document before creating your will unlike those assets specified in your will any assets included in your trust will transfer to the named beneficiary upon your death without passing through probate 8 x research source make sure that you are aware of what assets if any you have in a trust and do not include those assets for distribution in your will choose the beneficiaries for your will identify the persons or organizations to whom you wish to bequeath your assets upon your death for example your children spouse or favorite charity also consider what portion of your estate would go to each beneficiary 9 x research source take into account unexpected scenarios such as you your spouse and children dying at the same time how would you want to distribute your estate under those circumstances select a guardian for your minor children when one parent dies the other parent is usually awarded custody of minor children however if the other

research source identify at least two people who could serve as guardians for your children this will ensure you have a backup if one person is no longer available to care for your children at the time of your death discuss your decision with potential guardians before naming them in your will pick your executor in your will you will need to name one person to assume the responsibility of distributing your assets and paying your debts in accordance with your will this person is known as the executor it is important that you choose a person who is both trustworthy and organized 11 x research source avoid naming a beneficiary of the will to also serve as the executor if you think it might create a conflict of interest for example if you are leaving a portion of your estate to your daughter you may not want to name her to be the executor if it might create the appearance among her siblings that she will carry out the terms of the will to her advantage 12 x research source check your state s laws before selecting a non resident as your executor some states do not permit non residents to serve as the executor of a will 13 x research source do not choose an executor who is a

tailoring a will to your particular situation they ask you a series of questions intended to identify the key facts needed to make you a customized will 17 x research source some states offer statutory forms that conform to the requirements of a valid will for that particular state the downside to these forms is that they tend to be very simple and do not address many of the possible scenarios you may wish to include in your will these templates can usually be found online often on state bar websites 18 x research source if not using a statutory form keep in mind the template you are using may not have been made in accordance with the laws in your state for this reason it is very important that you review the requirements for your state to ensure that your will is valid

time of your death for example i name maria rodriguez to serve as my executor if maria rodriguez is unwilling or unable to serve as executor i name oliver dunn to serve as my executor 22 x research source insert a separate clause granting your executor the authority to manage your estate until it has been fully distributed for example i direct my executor to take all actions legally permissible

court for the independent administration of my estate 23 x research source name guardians for your children if you have minor children include a provision naming all of your children and stating who should be appointed to care for them in the event that you die 24 x research source beware that if you share custody of your children with another parent and the second parent survives you that person will have custody of your children the purpose of the guardianship provision is to direct the appointment of a third person who does not currently have custody of your children if neither of you is available to care for them for example if my wife does not survive me and it is necessary to appoint a guardian i appoint john and melissa smith to act as guardians of my children if for any reason john and melissa smith are unable or unwilling to serve as guardians to my children i appoint sara and jim donahue guardians of my children give instructions for your debts and taxes in addition to stating how you would like for your property to be distributed your will should also address how your debts and taxes should be paid 25 x research source example provision for debts except for liens

you as the witnesses may be brought into court to testify the state of the testator at the time of signing ask yourself whether the person sounds lucid can they talk clearly do they understand what you are saying are they aware of their surroundings pay attention to signs of intoxication is there alcohol on the testator s breath listen to the testator before signing the testator should acknowledge their will and state that it reflects their wishes they should also say they have made the will without any pressure from anyone 9 x research source if you don t hear the testator say these words you should ask them if they have read the will and if they are signing freely you aren t entitled as a witness to know what is in the will so don t ask to read it 10 x research source be on the lookout for coercion a will is not valid if signed under duress or coercion as a witness you might need to testify that the testator signed the will freely for these reasons keep your eyes

pushing papers in front of the testator do they seem overbearing if so you should be suspicious is the testator signing a lot of papers at once are you even getting confused as to what is going on if so the will signing might be coercive refuse to sign if you suspect coercion as a witness you have a duty not to sign if you think the testator has been coerced or if you don t think they are of sound mind if you suspect coercion speak up and explain why you can t act as a witness this might feel awkward nevertheless you are doing the testator a favor if you re right then you ve saved the testator from signing away their property if you re mistaken then they can find a different witness who possibly knows them better watch the testator sign the testator should initial every page and sign at the end 11 x research source a disabled testator can have someone sign for them at their direction sign the will as a witness watch the other witness sign and then sign yourself you will probably have to

cars to have auto insurance you may have a hard time finding an insurer who will write a policy for a car owned by a trust rather than an individual person because there s no way to check a driving record in those situations the successor trustee and the executor should get together with an experienced probate attorney and discuss their options it may be possible to simply transfer ownership of the car directly to the beneficiary to transfer ownership of real property the executor typically must create a new quitclaim deed sign it under the witness and notary formalities required by the

various legal forms providers online make sure the form you use meets your state s legal requirements include a firm deadline on your notice you might want to check the probate court s rules regarding how long a creditor has to file a claim and use that as a guide otherwise creditors can file a claim against the trust whenever they want and you ll have a hard time determining when assets can be distributed to the beneficiaries review claims in response to the notice the deceased person s creditors will submit claims to the trustee that state the type of debt and the amount of money the deceased person owed them these claims typically include some sort of proof of the validity of the debt 18 x research source 19 x research source if no proof of the validity of the debt is included with the creditor s claim you have the right as the successor trustee to demand it if the validity isn t proven you can legally dispute the validity of the debt and refuse to pay it keep in mind that

estate unless you have a firm grasp on the deceased person s debts and can easily get in contact with their creditors pay debts and taxes the successor trustee is responsible for paying off all of the deceased person s debts and filing that person s final income tax returns as well as any estate taxes that may be owed 20 x research source 21 x research source if it hasn t already been done the

trust taxes when you file the deceased person s final income tax return however you should use their social security number not the trust s ein if assets in the trust generate 600 or more in income you must file an income tax return for the estate as well if there are not enough monetary assets in the trust to cover the deceased person s debts as successor trustee you ll have to arrange an estate sale to sell estate assets to cover those debts unlike wills filed in probate you don t need any court approval to sell any estate assets including real property distribute the remaining trust property once the successor trustee is satisfied that all debts and taxes have been paid and there are no outstanding claims they will distribute the property still held in the trust to the trust beneficiaries according to the terms of the trust instrument 22 x research source 23 x research source if any of the trust s beneficiaries are children under the age of 18 the trust instrument typically will state how those assets are to be handled in most cases they are held in trust until the child reaches a certain age usually 18 or 21 for titled personal property or deeded real property

the questions about why you are divorcing both of you need to be on the same page about the why and not placing blame on one party or the other encourage your child ren to ask questions they may often be fearful of what life is going to look like from now on so be ready for a lot of logistical questions allow the children to ask you both anything but also understand you may not have all the answers

parenting easier 15 x research source your children may feel like they are stuck in the middle if they see one or both of you angry at the other they need to know they do not need to make a choice as

never get to the point where either of you react out of anger or violence your spouse is no longer a love interest but he or she will always be a parent focus on that neither parent should ask the

maintain an active social life keep yourself occupied with personal interests and relationships to keep your stress levels low and stay focused on your own goals plan ahead for special events holidays

their differences aside you may even want to frame it in these terms by asking if they d be willing to focus on the positive for a day in the interest of enjoying a special occasion altogether try saying something like i know you two have a hard time being around each other but i was hoping we could just have a day to focus on this milestone in my life talk to someone you can speak freely with

love both of us you should also avoid using your children to communicate with your ex for example saying tell your mother that she needs to come get this last box of her stuff is not appropriate your children are not couriers and are not there to pass information along to your ex if you need to talk to them text call email reach out to them directly let them express their emotions your child may experience a whole range of emotions just like you are probably experiencing try to listen to what they are expressing before reacting 15 x research source for example if your child gets angry and

ended questions about how they are feeling or what they think about the divorce 16 x research source you can also ask them about any concerns they might have for example they might be concerned about how often they will get to spend time with the other parent or if they will have to change schools it s important to keep questions open ended for example if you want to ask them their feelings about the divorce don t say are you feeling sad about the divorce instead say what feelings do you have about our divorce if they give you a one word answer e g sad mad scared try respond with another question for example if they say they are sad then say what about the divorce makes you feel sad don t push it though you should try to regularly ask questions to help them process their thoughts if they seem reluctant to talk then don t keep pushing them if they don t want to talk then come back and ask again another day be happy when they go see the other parent if you are sharing custody with your ex then don t let your child see you upset when they leave even if you are if your child sees that you are upset they may feel guilty and unable to enjoy time with the other parent 17 x research source be sure to smile when they leave if you want to say something then you can say have a great time with dad or mom i know they can t wait to see you resolve logistical issues there are a lot of practical matters that you re going to have to deal with during the divorce especially if you have kids together work on getting these matters resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible so that you can focus on the process of moving on with your life for example if you have kids together you re going to have to figure out how you re going to share custody or if you are at all until this is managed it s going to be difficult to move forward if you have a home that you ve purchased together you re going to have to figure how to split the things inside the home e g furniture electronics etc and what to do with the house will one of you continue living in the home or should you sell it process your emotions as you move forward you will probably have good days and bad days when it comes to dealing with your emotions you may feel fine and think you re finally healing and then wake up one morning feeling hopeless this is all part of the grieving process and you should expect to have some setbacks along the way keep in mind you and your ex will likely be processing your emotions at different times it often happens that the spouse who initiates the divorce began the process long before the legal act of divorcing possibly even years before the spouse who did not initiate the divorce however will likely just start processing the emotions shock anger disillusionment fear etc when asked for a divorce try to understand that you and your ex may not be on the same page emotionally while going through the process and have empathy for whatever your ex is experiencing remember that processing emotions is an active process not a passive one while you can just sit and stew in your emotions you ll probably do better if you find ways to actively deal with your emotions for example through talking with a professional or with a trusted family member or through journaling you can also try other methods such as expressing feelings through a creative activity such as painting or music many people find exercise to be a great way to deal with negative emotions a tough workout that gets you sweating and out of breath will help you work off some steam try taking a boxing class where you can let out anger in a healthy way set goals now that you are divorced your life is different you may have more free time and you now have one less person to answer to take this

how to divorce an unwilling spouse,a contested divorce where the parties don t agree on one or more important points is basically not a different process than an uncontested divorce you actually don t need your spouse s consent to divorce them but if you and your spouse can come to an agreement instead of a judge imposing one on you you ll probably both be happier the difference between contesting the divorce and not contesting it comes down to speed the parties don t voice disagreements in an uncontested divorce which makes it faster therefore a spouse in the midst of a contested divorce should focus on ways to minimize the conflict and how to find good counsel to guide them through the conflict making it as quick and painless as possible,find out how long they ve practiced divorce and family law just because the law degree on the wall was issued in a particular year doesn t mean they have the same amount of relevant experience lawyers can change specialties and let their

petitioner or the respondent you will need an attorney 7 x research source the grounds for a fault based divorce are things like drunkenness adultery abandonment and cruelty when fault is assigned in a divorce it usually follows that the party not at fault has a right to more of the marital assets unless your spouse is fine with having blame assigned to them and having to give up a greater share then they will contest the divorce grounds vary by state so use a lawyer to investigate the circumstances that apply to you no fault divorces are inherently less contentious than divorces which assign fault to one party when fault is unassigned the breakup of the marriage is usually chalked up to irreconcilable differences while this type of divorce can be contested or uncontested one party isn t

evidence you can to support your claim 14 x research source the exact elements for establishing fault in each state might differ but the basic outlines are the same although your attorney will almost certainly want to gather additional evidence it always helps to have as much as you can at the start to of the process when you do sit down with a lawyer this will save time and expense keep the evidence narrowly relevant to whatever grounds for fault you pursue for instance if you make a claim of adultery then gather emails pictures texts or witnesses that might corroborate your claim keep your distance you should strive to keep face to face communication to a minimum during the divorce little good will come of it regardless of whether both parties want a divorce or only one party does the more often you communicate face to face the more likely it is your relationship becomes more hostile think before you speak resolve to wait before you respond to anything your spouse has to say during the divorce if you two aren t communicating face to face then the only thing it will take to make this happen is a little self control waiting 24 hours before responding to an overture is a

divorcing for one children can t keep secrets and it will get back to your spouse and two your children don t need to hear it they will come to their own conclusions about their parent in time don t use your children as pawns or couriers this is unfair to your children and it exposes them to issues which they are not equipped to deal with divorce is a matter between you and your spouse 18 x research source don t withhold visitation because your spouse is late on child support just think about it if you and your ex were still married and they got fired from their job would you lock your kids in their room and not let them see their parent probably not your children didn t ask to be born they didn t ask to have a parent who couldn t pay child support on time but they need their parents no matter what bills their parent is behind on temper your expectations there are rarely winners in a divorce each party loses something because one household is becoming two households the goal is for each party to get what is fair not for one side to profit a lot of ill will is related to the shock of loss so keep this in mind when communicating with your spouse make yourself aware of the rules before you fly off the handle or decide to make your last stand on one particular issue make sure you understand what the basic rules of divorce are in your state in particular you need to know if you live in a community property state or an equitable division state in community property states marital property is divided 50 50 in equitable division states marital property is divided

likewise in some states the presumption is that custody will be split evenly in order to deviate from that presumption one side must show why or both sides must agree decide what s important if you cannot initially come to an agreement on the terms of the divorce you might be able to work most of it out if you go about it the right way start by making a list of all the items which will have to be negotiated such as child custody child and spousal support alimony and division of assets and liabilities then group then into the following categories items which are the most important to you and your spouse for most people this is going to be child custody support and ownership of the primary residence items which are important to one party but not the other this could include the possession of a personal collection a car or a second home items which are relatively unimportant to both of you don t get stuck if you and your spouse reach a sticking point in negotiations let it lie there are almost always other issues that you can move on to the issue you disagree on will still be there to deal with but you can still make good progress with the outline of your agreement 22 x research source 23 x research source disagreement creates hostility and suspicion the longer you linger on an issue that you both disagree on the less likely it is you will be able to agree on anything if you re getting a divorce the chances are relations between you and your spouse are hostile enough without creating additional reasons for hostility identify the interests underlying your positions instead of focusing on the different positions of you and your spouse try and identify the interests that motivate you and your spouse to take those positions 24 x research source the interest at the heart of a specific custody arrangement might be equal time with the children for example but the position one party has articulated might not indicate that if one parent is insisting on a an every other weekend custody arrangement that won t work for another parent an alternative arrangement that provides for equal time might also work to make this work you re going to have to put yourself in your spouse s shoes imagine your spouse is considerably older than you and nearing retirement while you aren t they might insist on retirement accounts that you feel are rightfully yours while you might be right on the merits consider that you might be able to get higher value in debts or more volatile assets like stocks or real estate in return,Family-Life

find out more have a list of questions prepared to ask 12 x research source for instance you can ask when and where the group meets you can also ask how long the group has been meeting another good question to bring up is whether the group accepts new members 13 x research source you can also ask questions about some of the other considerations in this section discuss what a typical meeting is like one way to get a sense of what a support group does is to ask what a typical meeting is like that gives the person you re talking to a chance to walk you through a meeting and it gives you a sense of whether it s what you re looking for or not 14 x research source for instance a typical meeting may spend 10 minutes on introductions 45 minutes on general discussion and 5 minutes wrapping up with another group you might find that they spend 30 minutes with someone speaking about issues related to divorce and 45 minutes on general discussion including time when you can speak about what s going on in your life you can ask if everyone at the meeting is encouraged to speak or if it s just open to those who feel like talking you should also ask how long a typical meeting runs if you only have time for a 45 minute meeting you don t want to join a group that typically runs 2 hours ask whether it s confidential ideally what is said in the group stays in the group different groups will have different confidentiality policies be sure to ask about confidentiality when you attend a meeting 15 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source also ask what measures are in place to protect confidentiality for instance maybe the group only uses first names 16 x research source consider the size the size of support groups can vary greatly the best size for a group is determined by what you want from the group for instance do you want a place where you can talk about your feelings or just one where you can feel camaraderie with others in the same situation the answer to that question may determine whether you choose a small or large group also it depends on whether you feel more comfortable in a larger crowd or a smaller group 17 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source for instance a group of five people may feel too small to you if you re a people person who likes to get to know a wide variety of people if you feel the need to talk openly about what you re going through a group of 20 people may not give you enough of a chance to talk if you re only meeting for an hour with 50 minutes devoted to taking that s only 2 1 2 minutes per person if everyone talks nonetheless a group of 20 may work fine if the main focus of the group is hearing people talk about issues related to divorce look at the leadership the best groups will have a good leader to facilitate the group a good leader facilitates discussion without hounding people when attending a meeting see if people seem like the are comfortable talking and if the leader is able to keep discussion going 18 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source that leader may or may not be a mental health professional but having a professional attend occasionally can help guide the group and discussion 19 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source assess what the meeting was like after visiting a group assess whether it is what you want or not for instance you can ask yourself how it made you feel while a meeting may make you work through some emotions it should hopefully leave you feeling a little better about yourself you should also feel comfortable in the group though it can take a few meetings to really get your bearings most importantly you should feel like the meetings and members are offering you support for what you are going through 20 x research source after a meeting spend a few minutes regrouping sit in your car for a bit if you have to but spend a little while thinking or writing about the meeting before going home jotting notes down can be helpful especially if you are trying to compare more than one group focus on what was most helpful and least helpful about the group what was most and least helpful should be personal to your needs for example maybe what was most helpful was the ability to spend time talking about your feelings on the other hand maybe what was least helpful was the leadership wasn t very strong and didn t guide the conversation well in that case you may need to find another group that is similar in size but that has stronger leadership maybe someone who is a professional consider location when going to a support group you re more likely to attend if it is convenient if you re finding it hard to choose between two groups pick the one that s most convenient for you you ll only get help from the group if you re able to go 21 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source for instance if the group is close to your work you may find it easy to stop off on the way home on the other hand if it s 30 minutes away you might find yourself skipping more often consider your goals what do you want to get out of this group if you can answer that question it can help you decide which group is best for you for instance your goal may be to improve your life and move forward or it might be to improve your self esteem for instance your goal may be to help process your feelings in that case you may want a group where you can talk more on the other hand you may just feel the need to be connected to other people after splitting with your spouse in that case you may want a group where talking is less of an emphasis understand support groups are not group therapy group therapy is run by a therapist while a support groups are often run by non professionals while some just provide an opportunity to talk others will provide you with information that may help you get through this hard time 22 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source a support group is just that support it s meant to provide you with a group of people who are going or have gone through what you re going through many people find it helpful to have a group like that to talk about what they re going through especially after their friends get tired of hearing about it know the limits depending on the size of your town you may not have that many options though you may not find your perfect group pick the one that has the best qualifications for what you need 23 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source as an example if you have two options that you like one a big group and one a small group consider what s most important for you you might pick the small group because you ll have more chances to talk or you might choose the large one to have a wider variety of perspectives another way to choose is to pick the one that makes you feel the most comfortable you need to feel at home in the group for it to provide you with the most support,Family-Life

have time to prepare as well for example consider telling your partner i would like to sit down and discuss options for ending our marriage i would like this to be a mutual decision so do you have some time to talk the more prepared both parties are the better the conversation will be when you schedule a time to talk make sure you do it in person choosing to annul a marriage or divorce is a serious decision to make and you do not want to do it over the phone or through an email however if you are afraid of how your partner might respond during your talk think about meeting at a public place or having the discussion over the phone you do not want to jeopardize your safety take responsibility for your feelings when you sit down with your partner be respectful but confident take control of the conversation and be honest if your partner is doing something in the relationship that has caused you to consider ending it let them know tell them how you feel for example if your

your sexual frustration they might open up about the source of their issue this might lead to you and your partner working to fix the issue as opposed to ending a marriage avoid angry comments and blaming your partner when you talk with your partner about annulment and divorce do not blame them for the situation you are in and do not get angry when anger becomes a part of the conversation it leads to irrational discussions that lead nowhere if you feel as though you are getting angry during the talk with your partner tell them you need a second to step away go for a walk or take a moment for yourself and come back when you are ready to continue just like anger blaming your partner for everything will not allow for an honest and open discussion when you blame your partner for something they get defensive and react emotionally keep the conversation factual and calculated if you feel the conversation starting to go downhill tell your partner that you will have to finish the conversation another time move forward one step at a time the initial conversation between you and your partner does not have to resolve every issue you both have this initial talk is supposed to allow you and your partner to open up and discuss options for ending the marriage use this first discussion to make a choice about annulment or divorce once a choice is made set up another time to talk about specifics for example focus your first talk around what an annulment is what a divorce is and what the best choice between them is given your factual situation discuss how your marriage was entered into and whether it may have led to a marriage that is void or voidable talk about your reasons for wanting to end the marriage and whether your state will allow a divorce for those reasons choose the best option for you and your partner use what you learned while evaluating your choices both alone and with your partner and come up with an informed decision if you qualify for annulment and you and your partner think that would be the best choice file for annulment if you do not qualify for annulment or if you think getting a divorce will offer more benefits than an annulment then you will need to file for divorce remember to try and file a joint uncontested petition whenever possible doing so will make finalizing your arrangements with the court much easier however in some circumstances a contested petition for divorce or annulment may be the only option this usually happens when one partner disagrees with the choice made between getting an annulment or divorce assess

choice was made independently or as a couple it is always a good idea to hire a lawyer a family law lawyer will help you through the legal process of filing for divorce or annulment in addition a lawyer will counsel you on whether your choice was a realistic one for example you and your partner might decide that an annulment would be best but a lawyer might be able to tell you that an annulment will not be possible in your situation ask friends and family for recommendations to find a qualified lawyer start by asking friends and family if they know anyone chances are at least one person you know will have someone in mind even if those close to you do not know a family law lawyer ask if they know any lawyers in general chances are even if you contact a criminal defense lawyer

strength of your case and determine whether they want to represent you when you attend an initial consultation bring all the paperwork you have regarding your marriage and the circumstances surrounding it this might include a marriage license birth certificates videos letters and anything else you think might help once you arrive for your meeting answer the lawyer s questions about your case during this period assess the lawyer s understanding of your situation and whether you think they can help do not be afraid to ask questions back in addition to asking questions about your case you should also ask about the lawyer s professional background history of legal troubles and ability to practice law where you need them to practice initial consultations can be free or the lawyer can charge you for them check with the lawyer s office prior to the meeting to determine if the lawyer will charge discuss fees before you leave the initial consultation make sure you talk with the lawyer about their fee structure most divorce lawyers who will also handle annulments charge by the hour in an hourly fee structure your lawyer will charge you for the amount of time they work on the case usually in fifteen minute increments the average hourly rate for a divorce lawyer is around 250 a lawyer s fee may go up or down depending on the complexity and amount of work you require 14 x research source in some circumstances a lawyer might charge you a flat fee for doing some divorce or annulment work for example some lawyers may charge a flat fee of 2 000 to file a joint petition for annulment in other circumstances a lawyer might accept property in lieu of cash if you do not have enough cash to pay your lawyer they may take real estate cars or even paintings in order to recoup the expense hire someone once you have interviewed possible lawyers and compared their strengths and weaknesses you will need to make a decision call the lawyer you are most comfortable with and let them know you would like them to represent you before the lawyer starts working for you make sure you sign a representation agreement which will set out the type of work the lawyer will do and how much the lawyer will charge file legal papers once the lawyer starts working for you they will assess your choice between a civil annulment and divorce and work to accomplish your goals if you want to get a civil annulment your lawyer will assess whether you qualify and will file the proper paperwork if you want to begin a divorce your lawyer will help you choose the best path and will help you

how to tell your parent you want to live with your other parent,being a child of parents that are divorced or separated is tough you have to deal with parents who don t get along and you are often sent back and forth between each parent one of the scariest things you might have to do is to tell the parent you live with that you want to live with the other parent there are lots of reasons you might want to live with the other parent and it will be very easy to hurt the parent you live with by telling them this it is important to try and be sensitive when telling them what you want so that you can make it less hard on your parent and to get the answer you hope for before taking any action think carefully about your reasons for wanting to move,understand that your parent may feel sad as a child of divorced parents you probably already know the tug of war that goes on for custody and it may be painful for you to watch and deal with try to remember though that in most cases your parents are trying to do what is best for you and if you tell them you don t want to live with them anymore they may feel like they have failed you or that you don t love them on the other hand you don t need to think that you are supposed to live with a parent if you are unhappy just because you don t want to hurt them in the end it s not up to you to keep your parents happy just try to keep in mind that it may hurt them to hear that you want to move out so it s important to try and be gentle think about why you want to move out sure your other parent may let you do whatever you want so it will be way more fun but is that the only reason take some time to think about all the reasons you want to move out and if they are good ones or not it is very easy for the parent you don t live with

reasons why you want to do so list your reasons for wanting to move there may be many reasons why you want to live with your other parent many of those reasons may have nothing to do with the parent you live with but some might before you have the conversation take time to make a list of the reasons you want to live with your other parent you don t need to give this list to the parent you live with and it may be hurtful for them to simply read a list of all the reasons you don t want to live with them without hearing you explain these reasons instead make the list so that it is clear for you why you want to leave and so that you can talk about these reasons clearly with your parent for example maybe you want to live with the other parent because they live much closer to your school or maybe it s a different reason altogether maybe the parent you live with is dating a lot of different people and you don t like being around all their boyfriends girlfriends know exactly what you want from the conversation do you want to live with your other parent and never see the one you live with now do you want to see them on the weekends do you want to continue living with the same parent but

time to give you the support you need before having a potentially difficult conversation think about whether or not your other parent will allow you to live with them maybe your other parent has some problems they have to deal with these problems may mean that they can t take care of you as a parent should maybe they travel all week and are never at home talk it out with someone you trust find someone you trust and tell them how you re feeling this may be the parent you wish to live with or it may be a grandparent or someone at school such as a guidance counselor talk to them about your wish to live with the other parent and the reasons why talking to someone may help you understand your reasons for wanting to move 4 x research source the person you talk to could also be able to give you advice on how to start this conversation with your parent be aware though that if your parents don t get along very well talking with the parent you wish to live with may not be the best idea if you are looking for an unbiased ear ask your parent if they have time to talk about something important don t just say you want to live with your other parent out of nowhere this will make them feel angry and or very sad if they are shocked by what you say they probably aren t going to be able to really listen because they will be dealing with the emotions they are feeling 5 x research source tell them you need some time to talk about something that is important to you they may be able to talk right away but if they re busy with something it may have to wait they may get mad even if you try to ease into the conversation without shocking them don t ask them to have this talk when you ve just had a fight or if you can tell that they are in a bad mood tell them that you love them depending on the reasons you want to move out you may be afraid that you will hurt your parents while it might be hard to hear that you want to leave reassuring them that you love them very much and that you don t want to move out to hurt them will help them understand that you want to stay close with them for example you can say before i tell you what s going on i want you to know that i love you very much it might be hard to hear what i am about to say but please don t think i don t care tell them the reasons you would like to live with your other parent start by saying i would like to live with dad or mom if that s the situation the reasons that i would like to live with them are try to explain each reason calmly and clearly if the reasons you don t want to live with the current parent anymore are because of how they treat you or because they have problems that are affecting you then bringing up these reasons may make your parent mad or embarrassed try to remember that it s important to be honest give them time to think about what you have said it s hard to predict how your parent will react they may get angry they may cry or they may not seem upset either way give them a chance to think about what you have said if they want to talk then listen to what they are saying 6 x research source they may ask for some time to think things through give them that time they may say no outright in this case there may not be much you can do you can try talking about the matter with your other parent to see what they think it may be possible for them to convince the parent you live with to reconsider keep calm if your parent reacts in a way that you don t like do your best to stay calm don t start yelling at them instead try to keep talking in a mature way if they have simply said no ask them if they can explain why it s not a good idea if they have given you many reasons then try to think through those reasons to see if they make sense 7 x research source if your parent is the type who believes that you should do as they say without ever asking why they may say that they don t need to explain the reasons for their decision to you if this happens you may be wasting your time but try to remember that the best thing you can do is to try to keep talking to them so that they see they can t just blow you off bring it up again later if your parent has said no tell them again in a month or two this way they will see that you really do want to live with the other parent and that you weren t just trying to cause problems if you do have to try again try to approach the conversation in the same way if you always bring up the conversation as maturely as you can it will show them that you are growing up and that you can make some decisions on your

decision not you it is not your fault it was an issue between your parents that caused the divorce not you or your siblings the decision is about their own relationship with each other and a belief that they can no longer get along as a couple 5 x research source remember they will always be your parents no matter if they are married or not don t try to figure out what happened and know that you can t undo it instead focusing on coping with the divorce ask your parents questions the aftermath of a divorce involves many changes your family may move to a new home or a new city you may have to divide your time between households or even go to a new school once you have gotten control of your emotions try to sit down with your parents and ask them about the details 6 x research source for

will likely be happy you spoke up 7 x research source express your worries by saying i m unhappy about having to change schools i will miss my team my teachers and my friends can i come back on weekends to see my friends don t bottle up your emotions doing this can lead to emotional outbursts and even make you sick if you don t feel comfortable talking to your parents you can still share your feelings by writing them a letter tell your parents you want to stay out of the bickering don t take sides during your parent s divorce your parents may have bitter feelings about one another but that shouldn t rub off on you even if you happen to hear about one parent s wrongdoing try to withhold any judgment there are a lot of issues between your parents that caused the divorce it won t do you any good to throw the blame on one parent 8 x research source if your parents try to pit you against one another tell them i won t be taking sides keep saying this until they get the message remember your role is to cope with the divorce not to resolve disputes between your parents your parents will get the support they need to resolve disputes from other adults remember that your parents still love you a divorce can bring out a lot of ugly actions and words between your parents if they are distant or upset recognize that they are trying to deal with their own feelings and cope with the marriage ending just because they may not love one another anymore doesn t mean they don t love you 9 x research source focus on the positives it may seem illogical but sometimes there is a silver lining in a divorce some kids may actually feel relieved that the marriage is ending especially if your parents fought a lot you might also like the idea of having two homes establishing new traditions or being able to have separate time with each of your parents 10 x research source looking for the positives in the situation can help you maintain perspective and not get lost in your grief anticipate even more changes in the future in the weeks and months after the initial breakup many other changes may happen your parents may have to go to court to determine who you will live with you may also notice financial strain in which your parents don t have as much extra money for you to go to the movies or for pizza with friends another possible change is the introduction of new people in your family such as a stepmom stepdad or even a new baby try to be understanding of these changes things may be very tense now but they probably won t always be this way resist the urge to automatically dislike your parents new partners you don t have to view this person as a parent and they won t replace your other parent but you can be open minded and try to get to know them 11 x research source try to balance your time with both parents if you re an older child your parents may give you some say in how you divide your time between them particularly if they each live nearby do your best to be fair about the amount of time you spend with each parent for instance if you re away on vacation with one parent be sure to call and check in with the other this helps each of your parents feel loved and maintains your connection with them both it s also a great idea to keep both parents in the loop about what s happening in your life one parent may be in the dark about academic or extracurricular achievements be sure to call them up and tell them when something happens good or bad 12 x research source stay involved in extracurricular activities the stress of your parent s divorce may have caused you to rethink your extracurriculars but you shouldn t playing sports participating in clubs and being involved at your school is an important part of your identity sticking with these activities can help you cope with other changes and give you something constructive to do divorces can be hectic but try to keep the same schedule if you need to change your schedule work with your parents to make your new schedule as similar to your old one as possible you should also keep participating in any birthday parties or sleepovers you are invited to 13 x research source make

how to co parent with an uncooperative ex spouse,working with an uncooperative ex can be difficult however how you work with the ex will depend on how uncooperative the ex is being for instance if you can t make anything work you may need to go to court or back to court to figure out a better custody arrangement you may also want to consider parallel parenting some of the steps listed in the article are closer to parallel parenting that is they encourage the two of you to respect each other s parenting styles since you re having trouble parenting together while at the same time you step out of each other s lives whatever way you choose you need to figure out the best way to work with your ex for the sake of your child,discuss time arrangements if the court has not mandated your time arrangements you need to have a discussion about them you can t just leave the arrangement vague and expect it to work well if you don t think you can decide on one alone consider talking with a counselor to help work it out 1 x research source you need to discuss what nights the child will be spending with which parent who s responsible for what activities and who s responsible for which care taking activities don t forget to discuss holidays and school breaks as you need to decide where the child will be during those times allocate decision making if you don t plan on making decisions together going forward you need to discuss who will make what decisions for instance who decides what activities the child gets to do who s responsible for the bulk of the child s healthcare these are important decisions in the life of your child and you need to make them together or decide who is responsible for the decision 2 x research source while true co parenting would be to make all of the decisions together it may not be feasible if you can t work together that s why it s important to decide who s going to make what decisions from the get go you should also consider religious upbringing as well which religion will the child follow another consideration is schooling will your child go to a public school or a private school going forward who will be responsible for making that decision separate your feelings from your child when you ve divorced from someone it can and usually does get messy you ve broken up with someone you once vowed to love and that hurts it s hard to move on and it s even tougher not to let those feelings interfere with how you are raising your child however if you can keep those feelings out you can work towards a much healthier relationship even if your ex remains uncooperative try thinking of your ex as a colleague rather than an ex you probably don t like everyone you work with but you still must get along with them in a professional manner in many ways this step is more parallel parenting though you are still working together to make decisions once you start thinking of the relationship this way it can help to calm the waters would you pick a fight over something small with a colleague not if you re acting professionally don t interfere with each other that is when your child is at your ex s house try not to text or call your child too much you should expect the same when your child is at your house the point of this step is to avoid creating a situation where you re trying to mediate between the other parent and the child 3 x research source that doesn t mean you can t talk to your child just that you shouldn t spend hours a day on the phone with your child nor should you get in the middle of arguments between your child and your ex skip the fights as often as possible try not to engage with your ex often you will be doing so in front of your kid since that will be the only time you see your ex therefore it s best not to get in verbal fights as that only hurts your kid more plus that keeps you entrenched in a negative relationship which you don t need in your life 4 x research source this step means you won t rise to the bait you won t respond with sarcasm even though you may feel like it it means that you have a responsibility to stay calm and not engage even if your ex is trying to engage you for instance say your ex says i noticed you forgot to pack a shirt for him this weekend big surprise you forgot something while you may be tempted to snap back at your ex instead say in a sincere tone i m sorry i forgot i ll remember next time thanks for taking the time to tell me being sincere and straightforward can start to disarm some of the nastiness resolve to be flexible with the time arrangement if you re still angry with your ex the last thing you ll want to do is give a little when it comes to the time arrangement especially if your ex is being uncooperative however giving a little can open up space for a better relationship in the future because it shows you re willing to compromise a bit think of it this way if you re mad at someone and they give you a cookie you re less likely to be as mad at them because they ve been generous to you it s a silly analogy but it shows how we think of relationships when one person gives a little the other person may be more willing to give a little too in addition your ex may be willing to be more flexible with the time arrangement in the future when you want to keep your kid for a special day stop trying to change your ex of course you can t control your ex s behavior however you can control what you do one way you can help the situation is stop trying to fix your ex especially if they keep trying to change you by stepping back you are signalling you are done with that type of relationship and in turn your ex may come to realize that they need to be done with that part of the relationship too re frame your statements making a statement to your ex about what he or she must do can be off putting instead try re framing your statements into requests that way your ex will at least feel like you are trying to work with them rather than dictate to them 5 x research source for instance you may be tempted to say you should stop taking our kid out for ice cream late at night instead try saying can we talk about charlie s bedtime i feel like he does better when we re both on the same page be direct even when you d rather avoid speaking to your ex it s important to be direct with your ex using your child as a mediator only puts stress on the kid plus messages can get mixed up when you send them through a kid whatever conflict you have face it directly 6 x research source in addition talking to your ex yourself shows your child how to deal with difficult situations with grace you re modeling a behavior that your child can rely on later it also leaves the burden of parenting on you and your ex not your kid resolve conflicts with problem solving bring up the issue you need to discuss say why it s important and what you want to happen once you ve brought up the issue give your ex a chance to react then discuss possible solutions until you come up with one you can both live with 7 x research source don t place blame rather discuss what problem is happening for instance instead of saying you give our kid too much sugar you could say i ve noticed charlie has behavioral problems after eating sugar move on to why you think it s important at his age i think too much sugar is detrimental i d like to reduce the sugar in his diet ask your ex for a reaction what do you think whether your ex agrees or disagrees discuss solutions you could say i understand you disagree but can we come up with a solution we both can live with what if we limit his sugar intake to one sugary snack a day go back and forth until you can come up with a compromise if you can t come up with a compromise you may need decide to disagree that is as long as your ex isn t being abusive he or she gets to make the decisions when your kid is with him or her consider child custody mediation this type of mediation is done by a professional the professional acts as a go between for you and your ex when you can t work things out in fact the mediator can even work without having you both in the same room at the same time so you won t have to bicker with your ex the agreements you come to are not binding by the law so you can change them later in court if you need to do so though some judges may take the agreements you made into consideration 8 x research source mediation can happen before or after you go to court to try to prevent you from going to court a first or second time generally you will hire one person you can both agree on as a mediator most of the time that person will be a lawyer though some people do work as professional mediators call the police in severe situations you may need to call the police for instance if your spouse isn t letting you have your kids when they are supposed to that is an appropriate time to call the police the police can then come out and make a documentation of it called a visitation interference 9 x research source that way if you do need to go to court you have documentation to back you up however the police will not remove the child from the home you ll need to go back to court in addition this step may only help you if you already have a court ordered custody arrangement in place consider going to court if you haven t been to court or even if you have you may need to go back to court if you can t work out your arrangements in that case you ll both need to hire lawyers to represent your side 10 x research source court can get messy so make it a last resort if possible if you feel like your ex spouse is an unfit parent you may want to fight for full custody in that case you ll need to be able to provide examples of how and why the other parent is unfit your lawyer can help you come up with ways to prove your point if you already have a court order for your custody arrangement you generally must prove that something substantial has changed to get a different arrangement this option is also important to consider if your ex spouse is delinquent on child support don t say bad things about your ex at least don t do so where your child can hear it if your child hears you saying bad things they will start questioning their relationship with your ex also it can cause your child stress to hear bad things about someone they love therefore try to save those conversations for your friends not your kids 11 x research source encourage your child to learn and grow in an environment where they are shuffled back and forth the child can feel a little lost especially if your spouse isn t as encouraging of your child and their independence therefore it s important that you take the time to nurture your child and encourage them to explore their strengths and skills 12 x research source one way to encourage independence is to let your children tackle projects by themselves or at least mostly by themselves giving them a chance to try new things without hovering helps them learn how to solve problems and grow another thing you can do is praise the child s accomplishments when your child has worked hard on something let them know that you noticed their hard work even if the result wasn t quite what they wanted for instance say your child got a b on a spelling test but they worked very hard through the whole week to get that b you could say i know you wanted a higher grade but i m proud of you for working so hard sometimes we don t get the result we want but if you do your best and work hard you can still be proud of yourself help your child learn emotional intelligence emotional intelligence is the ability to identify emotions in yourself and others it also involves being able to deal with those emotions positively helping your child to develop emotional intelligence will help them deal with the other parent if your ex isn t being as emotionally nurturing in addition it will teach your child coping skills they need later in life 13 x research source start by helping your child identifying what they re feeling for instance when your child throws a toy don t just react instead sit the child down and say i think you re feeling frustrated because you couldn t figure out the toy frustration is when you are annoyed because you can t get something to go how you want show empathy when your child is upset show you understand how it feels for instance you could say i know how upsetting frustration can feel i feel frustrated sometimes too help the child see how to deal with the emotion better i understand that you were frustrated but throwing the toy isn t an appropriate way to deal with that emotion if you re frustrated you can ask for help or choose to play with something else,Family-Life

how to implement a bird s nest custody arrangement,a bird s nest custody arrangement works around your children basically your children remain in the home and you and your ex take turns living there as well like birds alighting on the nest implementing such an agreement will require some soul searching and the ability to put in action what is quite a novel approach to raising children,decide whether both parents will remain nearby a bird s nest custody arrangement will only work if you re remaining close to your home if either parent wants to move away for extended periods of time then you probably shouldn t try this arrangement 1 x research source reach a custody agreement a bird s nest custody arrangement isn t worthwhile if one parent has custody most of the time and the other parent only visits in that case implementing the arrangement will be too costly and time consuming children are not traumatically scarred by leaving the house to visit a parent so don t be afraid of just establishing a regular visitation agreement instead 2 x research source a bird s nest custody arrangement works best if you have joint or fairly equal custody 3 x research source check your finances each spouse needs a separate residence away from the family home in order for a bird s nest custody arrangement to work in total this means three residences are maintained they don t need to be expensive but they must be large enough to hold your personal belongings a one bedroom apartment studio or even a shared condo or house might work fine it s possible to rent a place with your ex however you ll probably feel like you are invading each other s space for this reason each parent should probably have their own residence outside the home 4 x research source find apartments if you think you can financially swing a bird s nest arrangement check how much apartments or homes cost in the area depending on where you live you might not be able to find anything affordable if money is tight check whether you can stay with friends or family at least at first consider whether you want to start dating a new partner probably won t be thrilled to live in two different places so you need to take that into consideration if you ever remarry and have more children then a bird s nest arrangement won t work either be honest with yourself most bird s nest custody arrangements fail 5 x research source if you found it difficult to live in the same space while married it won t be much easier to share the same space now that you are divorced to succeed both parents must be committed to making the arrangement work it s possible that a bird s nest custody agreement will be part time at least until you sell your house or until your young children reach a certain age 6 x research source in that case it might succeed bird s nest agreements typically work best for couples that had cooperated well while married if you and your ex disagreed on rules or practices while married it may not be realistic to pursue a bird s nest agreement set a schedule you need to decide who will be in the house when if you already have a custody or visitation agreement then use that as your template however if you haven t yet set up a parenting plan you can come up with your own schedule the key is to pick a schedule you can stick with if you don t think you can be in the home every other week then don t include that in your arrangement describe the changeover although you will be sharing a house you don t need to be there at the same time in fact you should limit any overlap as much as possible pay particular attention to the changeover process when one parent comes to the house and the other parent leaves 7 x research source ideally the changeover can happen when the children are at school for example one parent leaves by noon on friday and the other parent arrives before the children return from school divide the bills since you are both sharing a house you ll need to divide

how to cope with parental alienation of children,a parent in a family that has divorced sometimes finds that their ex partner becomes beyond reasonable in creating difficulties and alienating children from contact this can be researched as parental alienation syndrome however its hard to define and hard to defend against,give yourself a chance to label the problem simply as a tactic by the other partner usually to gain some control or influence over the situation state the problem as simply as possible and write down this sentence as a label for that behavior now realize how obvious the motivation for it might be and clearly determine not to act that way in response write down a list of ways in which you are being provoked or are likely to be provoked so you know the warning signs when you are being affected by the other persons actions list simple alternative actions you can take which involve less response clear your head about whatever real justifications the other person might have for their actions and write down for yourself an acknowledgement of what these may be decide clearly to avoid repeating those faults in the future and the clear opposite actions that you could take to mark a change in your own behavior this might involve seeking help with problems such as anger alcohol drugs gambling morals or all typical human faults just work out how to be a better human being that can t be accused of anything with justification take some time out with a friend you really can trust maybe this could be a relative but it must be someone sensible who knows you well and who is likely to be trustworthy and discreet someone who won t spill the beans to the opposition find something enjoyable and diverting to do with someone else ideally this should involve a change in context so you are not immersed in the problems you are trying to address set aside some time and money to give attention to something interesting to take your mind of the other problem find ways of making your familiar environment a bit different now that things are different see yourself in some new clothes doing things differently take the trouble to organize better food some physical exercise new thoughts fresh ideas and information about human psychology if you have children involved write letters to them that you can send one day in the distant future this will establish the consistency of your feelings for them when they inevitably want to make decisions for themselves keep all legal papers in one folder and a diary and folder of all correspondence from the other person for the future have a computer file for emails log all phone calls with time and a brief code of the stuff that was said it will often be the same so a simple code helps avoid having to dwell on the power of the assertions start systematically remembering the good things that happened and separate them from the bad systematically put all these good things together so they are like a time capsule that you can choose to look at one day in the future now realize that you need a completely new capsule of information about your new life start filling it with notes and diaries about the things you can do that help move your mindset away from actions responsive to the problem if there is a dispute about children s custody or access be very clear in what is a reasonable and balanced solution make sure this is recorded somewhere appropriately either by filing a statement with the court or with the people who may have some influence over the other person make sure it is carefully typed or written and well presented so it shows that you are being fair and rational make it a statement of fact that any reasonable person would respect consider taking the step of changing the way your mind dwells on the problem in my case at one stage i wondered whether i would feel less despair if i knew that my children would never be able to return such as if they had died from natural causes etc whatever you do keep it firmly in mind that they can be as much victims of the actions of the other person as you are except they have less self defense against the insinuations and discredit that might be being propagated against you accept that for a time they may have to believe what they are told just to keep their relationship with the other parent manageable have faith that human beings are all so much the same that time will eventually show that you are not the monster that you might have been depicted to be hard to say it but perhaps its true try to move on from this problem once you have done all that you can reasonably do stop hammering away at a lost cause to do so might in fact be quite counterproductive so known when to give up for the time being try to get involved in other things that visibly show that the other person no longer has an influence over you based on what they remember project the attitude that their stuff is something from the past and you just no longer have time to dwell in that sort of rubbish don t validate anything by giving it attention or response put those matters below your dignity be a good friend to people who are embarking on similar family tragedy most of us wonder how anyone else could possibly understand as our life is falling apart be supportive but also realize that their decisions must be their own decisions not your advice at all costs avoid violence the problem with violence is that it affects you more than you can realize and is most unlikely to give any long term satisfaction don t do things that can t be undone and realize that even thinking that way takes a toll on your own mental health and recovery apart from everything else take off your shoes sometime and walk on fresh grass or go for a swim at a beach or river find somewhere silent and practice completing one thought after another until you only have one thing to think about at a time reduce your personal turmoil watch the things in nature that just go on time after time unaffected by these human problems i watch clouds small birds and inconsequential insects that just keep doing all the things they normally do get things into perspective the world is a very big place and our affairs are of very little real significance in the course of time,Family-Life

how to discipline your kids as divorced parents,when you re divorced disciplining your kids can be a challenge it s important to communicate with your ex and stay on good terms work with your ex to develop guidelines and expectations of appropriate behavior for your children and apply these guidelines uniformly in your households try to preserve as many of the rules you had for your children before the divorce beyond that communicate your behavioral expectations to your child and let them know the consequences for failing to fulfill these expectations be fair but always follow through with the consequences your kids expect,keep the rules relatively stable a divorce can upend children s lives if you introduce a bunch of new extremely restrictive or extremely lax rules following a divorce you ll only add to their stress confusion and unhappiness once your divorce is finalized carry over as many of the rules as possible from the time before you and your spouse divorced 1 x research source if you do decide to change a rule then make sure that you evaluate your reasons for the rule change for example if you decide to change your child s bedtime then consider whether you are changing the bedtime because your child is getting older or if you are changing the bedtime to be the cool parent be flexible when developing rules with your ex you and your ex might not agree on all the rules even many parents who are not divorced often disagree on the rules for their kids but think about each rule carefully and recognize the difference between an important rule like no playing near the street by yourself and a trivial rule like no television after 8 00 let your ex know that you expect consistency with these more serious rules learn to compromise on rules that don t directly affect your child s health and well being 2 x research source apply consistent discipline between households if you allow your kids to do something that your ex doesn t allow or vice versa they will come to resent the parent who restricts their freedom being consistent between households is also important to avoid confusion for your kids 3 x research source talk to your ex about specific rules for your kids that you believe you should both share between households ask your ex if they have any suggestions for rules too listen to their ideas and implement the rules in your own household if you agree follow through with discipline between households not only should expectations and privileges be the same for your kids no matter where they are but they should also get rewarded the same way so if your ex brings your kids back in the evening and says he or she promised them they could stay up a bit late tonight because they helped clean up the house you should honor that likewise if your ex informs you that your child has been naughty and therefore is not permitted television for the rest of the day let your child know that their behavior has consequences in your house too 4 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source be consistent within your household it s easy to give in to a child s complaints but if you do your kids will only push you for more and more leeway on the rules soon enough they ll be in control and that s a situation you don t want to be in be firm clear and consistent when applying the rules and administering discipline 5 x research source whether you want to make them happy or just want them to stop nagging you ll probably have moments of weakness and give in to their child but you should try to limit these occasions as much as possible and let your kids know that you re making a special exception this way they will understand that they should not expect you to agree to for instance staying up late or watching an extra hour of tv every time they ask for it make sure that the things you give in to are acceptable for example if you have a no soda rule then allowing your child to have a cola on the weekend might be acceptable however allowing your child to skip doing their homework would not be an acceptable thing to give in to your child about maintain a positive relationship with your ex if you and your ex are not on good terms or are tense around each other your kids will notice and if you criticize your ex directly to your kids they will definitely notice they might repeat these criticisms to your ex causing the relationship between you to deteriorate when you and your ex aren t getting along it can be difficult to coordinate child care including disciplinary issues 6 x research source if you find your ex really repulsive spend as little time around them as possible call them if you need to talk and wait until your kids are out of earshot always be polite to your ex even if they aren t polite to you have regular family meetings even if after a divorce your family consists of just you and your child it s important to have regular conversations with your kids during these meetings share your point of view about their performance both at school and at home if your child has been undisciplined in either category use the meeting to reiterate your rules and expectations 7 x research source if they have not met your expectations in either category remind them of the consequences and implement the necessary form of discipline for instance if your child hasn t been completing homework you could revoke their phone privileges for a few days if you have remarried you should of course include your partner in the conversation as well family meetings shouldn t take too long depending on how much you want to communicate with your child and how much they want to share with you five to ten minutes is usually enough time a good way to integrate regular meetings into your family schedule is to have them at the same time once each week then get a pizza go bowling or do something equally fun after the conversation don t let your kids guilt you into flexing the rules if you and your ex don t agree on certain rules your kids will surely let you know if they come back from a weekend with your ex and challenge a certain house rule on the grounds that but dad mom lets me don t rise to the bait instead reaffirm your rules by saying well this is not their house in this house the rules are different 8 x research source your child might ask why explain that you and your ex have different views about what is acceptable and what is not use these opportunities to remind your child of why there are certain rules and what the consequences of disobedience are investigate what your kids say kids can be sneaky if they try to convince you to change a rule based on something that your ex supposedly does especially something that causes real concern be sure to follow up with your ex let your kids know you intend to do so by announcing for instance at your dad s house you re allowed to eat all the candy you want i ll have to talk to them about that tomorrow 9 x research source you should also follow up when your kids report that their friends parents allow them to do something that you don t approve of too if your kids aren t behaving appropriately at their friends houses you might want to reconsider allowing them over there avoid making your ex the bad guy if your ex has a reasonable rule that they feel very strongly about and they want you to implement it too you should include it in your household s rules don t purposely neglect to enforce rules that your ex wants in order to gain points with your kids or snub your ex this might make them do the same thing to you leading to unhappiness for you and your kids 10 x research source doing this will hurt your kids because they will end up with less guidance and authority in their lives and feel frustrated by their parents immaturity provide visual reminders use a calendar erasable marker chart or apps and other digital reminders to help your kids stay disciplined place the calendar or board in a highly visible area like for instance the front of the fridge where your kids will always see it use these reminders to remind your kids of their responsibilities 11 x research source for example you might write a few chores on the calendar each day so that when your child comes home they ll be able to check it and know what is expected of them you could also send an email or text message to your child directly in order to help them maintain proper discipline discover why your children are misbehaving after a divorce children may lash out at their siblings peers or caretakers because they feel betrayed or saddened by the divorce in order to respond appropriately to the child s behavior you need to first understand why they are acting the way they are 12 x research source of course children who are not divorced might engage in these behaviors too but it s important to factor in the divorce as a possible underlying cause for bad behavior when disciplining your child as a divorced parent if a previously good child starts engaging in negative behavior following the divorce it s probably due to the trauma of the divorce if your child is hesitant to open up with you as children often are you might need to enlist help have your child see a child therapist armed with their special training in psychology child therapists can help your child explore his or her feelings and discover the causes underlying their behavior use age appropriate punishments as children grow their understanding about what kinds of behavior are right and wrong becomes more complex therefore kids of different ages should have different sets of punishments for toddlers and kindergarteners calmly saying no followed by timeout for a few minutes is usually effective for older kids grounding and the loss of privileges such as no tablet phone and laptop as your kids age allow them new privileges but also let them know that with their new privileges come new responsibilities and consequences for instance let your child know that if they re cyberbullying they will lose phone privileges for a time don t dish out unrealistic disciplinary action when you re angry for instance if you say you ll never play that videogame again and then later allow your child to play videogames they will come to take what you say about disciplinary action less seriously never use physical violence including spanking or slapping against your child this will only lead them to develop anger and doing so teaches your child that physical violence is an ok way to work through conflict which can cause problems for your child later in life using physical violence against your child can also reduce the strength of the trust and bond between you be honest about your feelings divorcees often project their feelings onto their kids or take the stress of a divorce out on them for instance you might discipline your child for doing or saying something similar to what their other parent often says or for saying something in a way that their other parent may have said it you might unconsciously express any lingering resentment toward your ex by being hard on your child 13 x research source for instance if you discipline your child for vague violations like their tone of voice or attitude step back and examine exactly what you mean by that one big red flag should be if your child does not understand why they re being punished good discipline should be based on clear understandable rules and expectations if you re having trouble confronting your emotions about the divorce seek professional help visit a reputable therapist to work through your issues compare your ex s parenting style to that of others when you re weighing the validity of a disciplinary action that your ex is proposing try to separate the proposal or punishment from the person your ex imagine that your mother or a neighbor was watching your children and had the same rule and reacted the same way your ex did how would you feel what would you say to them 14 x research source if you can imagine someone else enforcing a certain rule and think it would be reasonable in their case you should also accept when your ex does it if you and your ex ended things on a particularly bad note mentally substituting another person for your ex in this way can help you stay objective about whether they are being a good parent or not,Family-Life

be too emotional to craft a plan like this on their own in some cases the court may offer mediation services for this purpose counselors and therapists can also help especially if they are already familiar with the family decide how to split time after thinking about your children s needs the next step is generally to determine how to divide up custody time in other words you have to decide who gets the kids when there are any number of possible arrangements one common choice is the 2 2 3 plan in this arrangement kids spend monday and tuesday with mom wednesday and thursday with dad friday through sunday with mom then the schedule flips monday and tuesday with dad and so on 5 x research source another arrangement is a simple monday through thursday friday through sunday plan in which the week is simply divided into two chunks this isn t a completely even split but works well for school aged children who get to leave for school from the same home every day 6 x research source some people find that longer periods with each parent help create a better sense of stability for the children and choose to alternate full weeks months or even years 7 x research source a custody plan should also consider the children s ages and school schedules decide how to divide other responsibilities shared custody isn t just about scheduling where the children spend their days and nights

staying with at the time or are both parents always involved what about parent teacher conferences who gets the final say over major decisions in a child s life such as when a child can start dating or how to deal with major disciplinary matters are these responsibilities delegated or will they be discussed by both parents ultimately being able to make major decisions like this as a team is what

your children 8 x research source keep in mind that shared custody plans work best when both parents have agreed upon custody decisions prior to separating get a judge to approve the agreement a

that gets in the way of us loving each other however we love you very much don t say your dad is a jerk and he doesn t understand what s important in life keep lines of communication open when your child is staying with you he or she may at times wish to speak to the other parent this may happen even if he or she only staying with you a short time you should almost always allow this your children should be allowed to call text or email the other parent at any reasonable hour children often experience anxiety from being separated from a beloved parent being allowed to contact the other parent at any time can help lessen this anxiety 14 x trustworthy source state of massachusetts official website for the state of massachusetts go to source if this occurs try not take it personally just because your children want to talk to their other parent doesn t mean they don t love your or want to be around you also at holidays if your children are staying with you they should be

your kids off at your ex s home rather than waiting for them to be picked up from your home when it s time for your children to go visit the other parent always drop them off instead of waiting for your ex to come get them encourage your ex to do the same when the children come to visit you dropping the kids off rather than waiting for a pickup helps avoid the sensation of the children being taken away by one parent or the other 16 x research source this can make the transition between households easier for both the children and the parent they are leaving for a while this also reduces the risk of interrupting a special moment between your children and your ex listen to your child make sure that whatever your child s age he or she gets to express feelings about and have some input on the custody arrangements this will help the child feel more secure and loved regardless of which home he or she is at 17 x research source for young children give them some control over small matters such as which toys they want to take when changing households for example you could say time to go see your dad is there anything you want to take with you this weekend for teens you might give them the opportunity to make suggestions about which home they would prefer to be at on given days of the week based on their calendar of activities and social events they may know better than you which is the more convenient home for them to live at on any given night for example you might say it seems like your social calendar is pretty full these days does the schedule we have make sense these days or is there anyway your father and i could make things easier for you ultimately you and the other parent are in control and have the final say on these matters but giving the child an opportunity to be heard will make this situation more agreeable to him or her re evaluate and modify the custody plan if necessary as your children get older life will change both for them and for you

parents need to make a decision about 22 x research source find ways to communicate agreeably however you may feel about your ex the regular conversations you need to have with him or her will be easier if you can find ways to communicate in a civil and adult way 23 x research source if there s a problem in the child s life that you think the other parent is responsible for try to avoid accusations instead discuss the problem for example you might say i notice the kids always challenge me about bedtimes after returning to your house any ideas about how we can handle this even if you think the other parent may be failing to enforce the agreed upon bedtime don t make this accusation if disagreements become common and you believe the other parent isn t living up to his or her end of the agreement keep records of the content of your conversations in case they are needed in court pick your battles and keep them private inevitably conflicts will arise about parenting if you and your ex were perfectly harmonious you probably wouldn t have broken up choose what you think is really worth having contentious discussion about and try to let things go that aren t that important 24 x research source for example if the other parent wants to change your children s school or is feeding them food that they are allergic to these might be issues worth having a fight over on the other hand if your ex lets your teen aged children listen to music you don t approve of think about whether you think that s really harming them before starting a fight it may be best to save your energy and preserve goodwill rather than fighting about minor issues such as household rules which can differ from house to house when you do have to have heated or contentious discussions about parenting don t ever do it in front of your children this can cause them unnecessary stress and emotional harm 25 x trustworthy source state of massachusetts official website for the state of massachusetts go to source be flexible while consistency is important so too is some degree of flexibility 26 x research source be aware that life circumstances may require some changes to the custody plan to be made on the fly things happen that are not anticipated and therefore not in the agreement be fair and realistic about your own life and commitments as well as your ex s if you can have reasonable conversations about how to handle unforeseen changes your shared custody arrangement is much more likely to survive and succeed for example you or your ex may suddenly need to go out of town to deal with a personal or work related issue during a time you were supposed to care for your children try to be flexible and reasonably accommodating to such circumstances,Family-Life

you ll ever make so it s important that you re 100 certain that your marriage is really over before you start taking the next steps if you re on this page chances are that you ve already made up your mind but here are some reasons that your marriage may really be over if you ve already basically uncoupled this means that you and your husband have separate friends separate interests don t spend time with each other and don t really know what s going on in each other s lives if your husband is no longer willing to try if you ve repeatedly brought up the problems in your marriage and your husband either promises to change and never does or flat out refuses to change then it may be time to leave if you re in an abusive relationship then get out there are no good reasons to stay in an abusive relationship or to prolong your pain if your relationship is truly abusive then it may be best to get out asap and to figure out the rest once you re safe if one or both of you has been repeatedly unfaithful it s different if one of you has had a fling and has worked hard never to let it happen again but if cheating and flings are the status quo in your relationship then it may be beyond saving if you no longer feel like a team if you have stopped making decisions together communicating or compromising then it may be time to leave if you can t agree on whether or not to have kids if you re dying to have kids but your husband refuses or vice versa then there may be no point in continuing the relationship if you can t see eye to eye on this important matter see if you can make this decision with a cool head you should not decide to leave your husband in the heat of the moment but after you ve had some time to really think it over see if you ve tried everything and nothing s worked if you ve tried couples therapy had many long conversations with your husband and if both of you have attempted to change your ways but to no avail then it may be time to leave but if you ve felt dissatisfied for a while and your husband seems to have no idea it may be worth it to see if you can talk things through first consider having an honest conversation about it the steps below can help you make the plans you need to make to leave your husband secretly letting him know only as or after you walk out that door this can be helpful if you re not sure how your husband will react or if you think he ll try to stop you from leaving but if you re both open to conversations if he s very supportive and if you re always honest and open with each other then you may just want to talk to him first and see if you can work things out you may be surprised by how many of your feelings your husband shares or by the lengths he s willing to go to not lose you this doesn t mean that you should let your husband convince you to stay but if you re on the fence and aren t sure if maybe you can really make things work then talking to him can make a big difference keep your decision to yourself it may be hard but this step can be vital in many ways leaving a marriage can be a volatile situation and staying quiet will allow you the time to prepare and establish yourself before you actually walk out the door tell only a few close people who support your decision tell the people who can give you some help and guidance not people who can t keep it to themselves if you don t want to talk it out with your husband and want to escape a bad situation then it s better to keep it to yourself so you have time to figure out the details if your husband knows about your plans and doesn t want you to leave then he can try to thwart your plans or to make it very difficult for you to get things done this may seem sneaky but your goal should be to leave on the best financial footing you don t want your husband to get in the way of that it may be hard not to act once you ve made your decision but it could take between two to six months to plan an exit strategy that will help you keep your footing financially though you may be ready to walk out that door any second know that it may be better in the long run if you take some time to get organized before you leave set up a separate bank account this is especially tricky for stay at home mothers who may not have outside income but having some money saved up will help you move forward on a better financial footing starting a separate account even if you don t have much money to put in there at first can help get you on the right track this will make it easier for you to have your own finances sorted out once you do leave your husband taking money from a joint account should be a last resort something you do right before you leave find a place to live if you are leaving the marital home it is important to find a new place to live in some cases temporarily staying with other people can be helpful but in the long term you will need to find housing you can afford this will raise some bigger questions about where you will live if you don t have children it may even be relatively easy for you to move across the country to be closer to your family maybe you just want to try something new and want to live in a new climate whatever you want to do having either a plan and a temporary place to stay or even signing a lease at another place can get you closer to your goal if you and your husband are really on the same page about the divorce and are comfortable enough with each other to talk about it then you can talk about who is going to move out of the home you share together if there are children involved this can be an even more important question as soon as you ve made your decision try to save money for the move regardless of whether you re moving across town or across the country you ll likely find yourself on a stricter budget after you leave get your paperwork together throughout a marriage you will accumulate many important documents such as paperwork pertaining to your mortgage vehicle and retirement plans among others make sure you have a copy of these documents since the property in question could be an issue in the divorce if you see many documents that you re sure if you ll need then you should make a copy of those just in case they end up being important it s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to getting your paperwork together if you really want to make thorough copies of everything then you may want to hire a professional to make a copy of your home computer s hard drive and even to take photos of certain valuable belongings this can help you in the future if some money goes missing during your settlement make a plan for your children if you have any if you and your husband have children together then it s important to figure out what s best for them do you think your husband is a great or at least decent father who will be involved in his children s lives or do you have reasons to believe your children should have nothing to do with him this will be one of the biggest decisions you make throughout the process just keep in mind that you can t just decide your children shouldn t see your husband because you don t want to see him anymore there should be a good reason like alcohol abuse to keep him away from his kids you should make this decision with an even head because it will determine many things such as potentially the place where you live as well as your children s futures contact a divorce lawyer a divorce is costly and time consuming so you may wish to shop around for a price you can afford especially if you think it will be a drawn out process though you may be tempted to save money and to do this yourself the right lawyer can really help you make the process easier and less painful you don t want to end up getting embroiled in a financial mess you don t know how to fix just because you didn t want to spend money on a lawyer if you really don t have the budget for this then you can consider hiring a paralegal start planning your post divorce budget if you re doing incredibly well financially already then this is definitely a bonus but it s important to consider the budget you ll have after you leave your husband it s important to ask yourself these questions before you walk out the door so you don t feel stumped when the time comes unfortunately studies show that many women have to deal with a 1 4th or even a 1 3rd drop in their standard of living after a divorce however don t let this discourage you if you make a solid plan you ll work through it here are some things you ll have to figure out what new expenses will you take on where will you cut back how much more will child care cost if you have children how will you earn the income that you need don t depend on alimony alimony or child support could definitely be a part of your future income but in today s economy it may not be a guarantee if you re certain that your husband will pay reliably that s one thing but you have to ask yourself if you can really count on your husband this can get even trickier if you re the main breadwinner because then you will be the one paying alimony establish your own credit record if you don t have a credit record apart from your spouse then it s important to get one as soon as you can you can start by getting a copy of your credit report you can get at least one free copy a year from each of the three bureaus at annoualcreditreport com check it out and look for errors then begin to build your own credit by making wise purchases making payments on time and being thoughtful in your money management you may think that you have a strong credit record just because your husband does but this may not be the case if you have not been very involved in the financial aspect of your lives make plans to boost your income after you have a better sense of the budget you need to live on then you have to think about whether or not you need to boost your income to cover it if you have a well paying job and plenty of savings then great but if you need to get a job and have spent time out of the work force or if you need a higher paying job then you ll need to make moves in that direction this doesn t mean you should become ceo of a new company before you leave your husband but you can make some moves to make it easier to boost your income once you do leave here are some things you can do take classes that help you specialize in necessary skills for getting the work you want whether you need to brush up on your computer skills or to get certified in a specialized form of training buy a new suit so you are interview ready when the time comes get your resume in order you don t have to send it out before you leave your husband but you should have it on hand when the time comes once you leave you are likely to feel even more overwhelmed and you may not have the time or mental strength to do something like update your resume pack your belongings you may choose to start with the smaller less obvious items or you may decide to do it all in one day you must determine what the safest approach is for your situation if you think your husband is going to get violent or threatening if he sees you packing up your things make a plan to do this when there s little chance he ll be around still though it s best to have some friends or family members there to help you for your own safety and protection it can be helpful to pack when your husband is at work even if he supports you in leaving packing when he s around can be more painful leave you may have already told your spouse you are leaving or it may come as a complete surprise even if you know you have made the right decision this last step may be the hardest emotionally of course every situation is different if you and your spouse have been talking about this for months then it may not come as a shock if you re in an abusive or threatening situation then leaving suddenly is your best option whatever your reason for leaving it s up to you to decide which method of leaving is best whether it s a frank and honest conversation or leaving without a note get as much emotional support as you can this is not the time to be alone with your worries after you leave your husband you should lean on your family your friends or even a therapist as much as you can this is likely the hardest thing you ll ever have to do and the pain will be much more manageable if you have the support and love of the people who care about you the most there s no shame in asking for help though it s important to get some alone time to deal with your feelings it s equally important to be out and about to make plans with your friends and to indulge in long conversations don t be afraid to call up old friends to ask for help or just to chat they ll understand that you re going through something very difficult and will support you all the way unfortunately not everyone may be on board with your plan and you may lose some friends or family support in the process don t let this stop you from being firm in your decision and know that your decision can lead you to build new and rewarding friendships get back on your feet this may not happen overnight you will have to recover both emotionally and financially and it can take years for you to feel independent and in control of your life again the important thing is that you know that you are on the path to recovery and that the decision you made will lead to more happiness in the long run even if it may not feel that way now and once you ve gotten back on your feet you can praise yourself for having the strength to decide to leave your husband and for following through on your ideas though women tend to lose financially after a divorce this does not keep them from exploring new things they never knew they loved advancing in their careers or doing many amazing things that they were not able to do during their marriage in the long run you should be able to not only get back on your feet but to become a stronger wiser and more fulfilled person in the process,Family-Life
how to leave your wife,separation and divorce are never easy and leaving your wife after you ve decided to call it quits can be one of the toughest things you ll ever do the process is never pretty but if you protect yourself and stay calm you can make it through in one piece,figure out if you have a hard or soft problem a hard problem is a fixed issue that causes unsolvable damage and if you are facing a hard problem you should leave the relationship as soon as possible a soft problem is less defined and may or may not have a solution so you should take your time to really evaluate your marriage before ending it over a soft problem hard problems include the three a s abuse addiction and adultery soft problems include things like growing apart or no longer feeling the sensation of being in love these problems usually mask unrecognized problems like feeling isolated ignored or criticized you need to pinpoint your underlying problems and address them before you can conclude that leaving your wife is the best way to remedy them 1 x research source be honest and realistic leaving your wife will be a brutal process even if you manage to separate on fairly amiable terms if you catch yourself dreaming of an idealistic future and want to leave your wife simply to pursue it stop right there and reconsider for example if you re thinking of leaving your wife for an old high school sweetheart or a new exciting lover there s a high probability that you are treating your new relationship with too much idealism and not looking at the benefits of your current marriage or considering the repercussions that may result from leaving under these conditions 2 x research source get help if help is an option if you have a soft problem try working things out with your wife seek out a marriage counselor and see if there is anything you can do to make your marriage work again before you call it quits make a break for it once you are certain that leaving your wife is the best possible option start the process and don t look back one of the most important things you need is certainty so if your decision is sound right now stick with it and try not to doubt yourself in the future tell someone 3 x research source as you start the process find someone whom you can talk to as a confidant throughout the ordeal this person should not be your wife or someone whose allegiance lies with your wife over you pick a reliable friend or relative or hire a professional therapist a confidant can lend you emotional support throughout the process and guide you objectively when your emotions are clouding your perspective letting someone know also adds a level of safety to the entire process figure out where you ll go you will need a place to stay after you leave home if you cannot iron out any long term plans at least figure out where you can go on a temporary basis immediately after the separation occurs the place you pick should be available to you for a few months at least if you plan on staying at a friend s or relative s house find out in advance how long you can stay there if you plan on moving into your own place begin shopping around for an apartment before you declare your intentions to your wife if possible sign the lease on your new place before you officially leave your wife clarify your expectations for most situations leave ultimately means divorce ask yourself if this is what you expect and want to happen or if a legal separation is a better alternative for the time being list your shared assets make a list of everything you share with your wife money valuables properties and so on plan out how you think these assets should be split between you after you leave if your financial assets are all kept in one place you have a legal right to half of those finances valuables that are owned by both you and your spouse must be divided equally those that are specifically yours including family heirlooms can be counted among your goods for the items you own jointly make a list of those that you would be fine losing and those that you intend to fight for you also need to find out which services are linked and which are separate services include things like phone and internet plans a service you will no longer use like the internet at your house will become your wife s responsibility joined mobile plans will need to be split apart once the divorce or separation begins find all your necessary and important paperwork this includes your marriage certificate and all deeds and titles locate the paperwork and make copies you should store these copies in a secure location outside of your home especially if you suspect problems during the split look for vital statistics military records related to benefits bank statements insurance policies social security statements information regarding retirement accounts vehicle titles mortgage statements loan documents kids school records and contact lists credit card statements checkbook statements and stock certificates 4 x research source open your own bank account if you only have a shared account or if your wife has access to your personal account open your own private account without her knowledge redirect your paychecks so that they are directly deposited into this new account keep an eye on any joint accounts during this time as well if your wife is manipulative or emotionally abusive she may start withdrawing money from those accounts in an attempt to prevent you from leaving you can usually withdraw up to half of the money in your joint accounts but doing so suddenly could alert your wife to the fact that something is amiss move your keepsakes to a secure location if you trust your wife well enough you may not need to move your personal keepsakes and heirlooms anywhere if you are anticipating a problem though it s a good idea to stealthily remove anything that could be damaged or somehow used against you make sure that any item you remove from the house can legally be defined as belonging to you as a separate person rather than to you and your wife usually gifts and inherited valuables belong to an individual instead of a married couple hide any weapons or possible weapons again if you expect an amiable enough split you probably don t need to worry about firearms in the home if you have any reason to fear for your physical safety or for the safety of your wife though you should remove those weapons from the home and place them in a secure spot without your wife s knowledge you may not worry about your wife pulling a gun on you but also keep in mind what she might do to herself after you leave if there is any chance that your wife might harm herself you should still remove all of the firearms from the house make spare keys this is advisable regardless of whether or not your wife is usually an even tempered woman make a spare key for your car your home and anything else important give these spare keys to a trusted friend or relative know whether or not to alert law enforcement this usually won t be necessary but if your wife has threatened to file a false report of domestic abuse in the past she just might follow through with that threat once she finds out that you intend to leave her let your local law enforcement officials know about any threats made in the past tell the police about her previous threats and about your upcoming talk and ask them about ways to protect yourself against false reports the police may still need to check on a situation when a claim of domestic abuse has been made but if they have advance warning they might take that into account when deciding what action to take in regards to that claim write a script plan out everything you plan to tell your wife before you actually break the news to her have a script and memorize it to the best of your ability you do not need to know every word but you do need to remember every point keep the focus on your reasons for leaving and on your experience avoid accusatory language that pushes the blame on your wife even if you feel that your wife is largely to blame describe your expectations separation divorce and make sure that you leave room in the conversation for your wife to reply to those expectations with her own thoughts check yourself as you prepare the script ask if anything you wrote has been written out of anger or a desire to hurt your wife if so remove or revise that portion have your confidant on standby you will likely need support after you talk things through with your wife let your chosen confidant know when you plan on breaking the news and ask him or her to be available to talk afterward make a deliberate plan do not spring the news on your wife at random you need to plan out the day time and location arrange things with your wife so that she knows to leave the time slot open but do not tell her before the predetermined time do not surprise your wife with the news before she leaves for work or when you re out at a party or restaurant set aside a time when you can talk without restrictions on time or speaking volume if you are worried about your physical safety choose a public place that still offers some degree of privacy like a park stick with your plan and resist the temptation to blurt everything out ahead of time in a moment of anger or pain stay calm and go through your script sit down with your wife and calmly go through the script you created earlier expect her to be emotional but try to avoid getting into any screaming matches during the talk remain as calm detached and objective as possible keep in mind that you should talk with your wife not at her pause during your script to check in with her making sure that everything is sinking in be focused and consistent remember that your talk has a specific purpose do not say or do anything that could confuse that purpose during the duration of your talk you might want to soothe your wife s feelings or get distracted by the good memories you ve shared but doing so will only delay the inevitable and draw things out even longer for both of you avoid arguing over the meaning of words and state things simply yet as kindly as possible to improve your odds of being understood try to be understanding if your wife is surprised or hurt by your declaration but do not back down or feel the need to justify your decision 5 x research source tell your kids if applicable if you and your wife have kids figure out how to tell them ideally you and your wife should tell your children together if you suspect that your wife will attempt to manipulate them however you need to sit down with your kids and have a separate talk with them make a script for your kids in the same way you made a script for your wife be honest and make sure that they are not to blame for the separation even if your kids are already adults you should wait until after you leave before telling them about it separate immediately after you tell your wife that you re leaving you need to actually leave pack your bags and leave the house that same night if at all possible staying in the same living space as your wife is asking for trouble the atmosphere will be more volatile and the two of you will be more likely to snap at each other or do something regrettable hire a lawyer and start the process do not drag your feet you might be tempted to think that you can take your time on the legal proceedings once you are physically separated from your wife but the longer you procrastinate the harder it will actually be to make the next move many jurisdictions enact orders that can protect your assets during the divorce process but these court orders can only come into effect once you file there is also some chance that your wife will not take you seriously until she actually has those divorce papers in hand cut off all ties while some exes can eventually become friends again for right now you need to cut off all contact that is unrelated to the divorce or separation you ll still need to keep in touch with each other to sort out details of the separation and if you have kids you will have to deal with each other even more frequently you need to cut out social calls though especially those made on lonely nights when you re craving intimacy stay strong the process is difficult but you can make it through turn to loved ones and therapists for emotional support as needed and consult with a lawyer or law expert for legal support,Family-Life

transition for you both during the separation practice what you are going to say this is going to likely be a very hard conversation to have with your husband so get out a piece of paper and write down a few possible things you may include when you tell your husband about the divorce 3 x research source keep in mind you are about to break some bad news that will probably evoke strong emotions

if we can work on some of the things that are troubling me will give your husband the impression you want to fix the marriage so if this is not your intent avoid statements like this 4 x research source find a private quiet space choose a time when you are both alone and no one is going to barge in during the conversation look for a space in your home like the living room or the dining room

also compassionate 6 x research source being respectful during the conversation will also make it easier to talk about other logistical things like shared custody of the children if there are any and

and avoid placing any blame or shame on your husband 7 x research source for example i know this may be hard to hear but i believe our marriage is over and i would like a divorce or we have both tried but it s not working between us and i do not believe that any more counseling or therapy will help i think the marriage is over and that we have to divorce be prepared for an angry response even if your husband may be aware there are issues in your marriage he will likely be upset when you tell him you want a divorce but it s important that you do not retaliate try to defend yourself or try to justify your decision 8 x research source for example he may respond to you with this is just another example of you trying to run away from responsibility you are so selfish and only think about yourself i have given you everything i have i ve tried so hard to make this family and this home i don t deserve this and the kids don t deserve this avoid a response like don t lecture me i m leaving because i m sick and tired of your childish crap i m sick of living in this house and i m sick of living without sex or affection i ve tried to make this marriage work and you block me out whenever i ask you to change this response may feel good for about two minutes but will ultimately lead to a bitter fight instead respond with i know this is very painful and i am so sorry i am doing this but i just can t see an alternative i don t have the feelings that we would need to make it work there is too much distance between us to overcome this response is better because it is not defensive or angry you are showing your husband that you feel your decision is correct and it is not coming from a place of self defense you are also showing your husband that you are aware that any anger or defensiveness from you will only create more anger and hurt between the both of you address the possibility of a trial separation once his initial anger simmers down your husband may try to negotiate with you on the terms of the separation he may ask for a trial separation where you both are separated but legally still married or he may ask you if you can both try therapy or counseling again you should be prepared for these types of questions especially if your husband will be devastated by your wish for a divorce 9 x research source if you are serious about the divorce be firm about your decision tell your husband i don t think a trial separation is the answer we have tried to fix our marriage and i don t think at this point it is going to work avoid discussing the details of the

separate 10 x research source reassure him that you are willing to work with him to achieve a fair and civil separation and to work with an attorney to find the best arrangement for the both of you

so take your time and think about what i have said decide on your living arrangements it s a good idea to determine if you are going to be staying in the home or if you are going to move out coming to

also less expensive if you and your husband are able to settle your issues without legal involvement if it is not possible to keep a lawyer out of it make sure you hire an attorney that is willing to litigate your case before a judge the attorney should know the value of settling the divorce quickly but he should also be willing to fight for you in court should the need arise interview at least three attorneys before you decide on one look for a divorce attorney who has at least 5 10 years experience practicing family and divorce law gather your financial information you need a clear picture of where you and your spouse stand financially one of the main goals of a divorce is to have an equitable distribution of marital assets and debts to get your fair share you need to know what is owned by you and your husband and what is owed by you and your husband to do this make a list of all possible assets that you own or partly own some shared marital assets are obvious the marital home and

you need to bring it up with your partner while it may not be a huge surprise to your partner it could still be an emotional shock that should be given proper weight,prepare your spouse you don t want to blindside the person out of nowhere alerting your spouse that you want to have a discussion can help him or her mentally prepare for what s ahead even if they re not aware of exactly what you re going to say 1 x research source you could say i d like to discuss where our relationship is headed can we sit down and talk about it soon that helps clue your partner into the fact that something s up also pick a good time to sit down in person this conversation isn t one you want to have over email or the phone this conversation needs to happen in person when your spouse has the time and emotional space to deal with it you don t want to be distracted by other things it might be a good idea to have someone babysit for you if you have kids while you don t want to put it off timing is everything for instance if your spouse s parent died last week you may want to wait a little while 2 x research source express your hopes and fears you may want to circle around the topic but it s best to just get it over with though you can be gentle about it in addition you need to take responsibility for why you want this separation that is you need to tell your partner why you feel the need to separate 3 x research source lead with what you want the discussion to be about you could say i don t think we ve been in the same place lately and i feel us growing apart i d like to discuss the possibility of a trial separation don t be afraid to talk about what you re feeling i am afraid that if we go on like this we will fight and argue our way to divorce and i hope that spending some time apart will help us see what our options are without ruining each other in the process establish what you want from the separation now that you ve broached the topic you need to let your spouse know what you expect to happen from the separation though it can hurt being in the same page is important because it helps to guide your expectations through the separation 4 x research source for instance if you think the separation is a stepping stone to a divorce you could say right now i m really just trying to figure out what i want however if things don t change between us i could see this leading to a more permanent separation on the other hand if you want the separation as a time to think with the hopes of reconciliation you might say i know asking for a separation is hurtful to you however i don t think things have been right between us for a while and i think we need some time apart to figure out how to move forward in our relationship i really do want to work it out though and hopefully get back together after our time apart give your spouse a chance to react this conversation may come as a hard blow even if your spouse realizes you ve been having problems as a couple let your spouse have a chance to react as his or her first reaction is probably going to be emotional give your spouse a chance to talk through it before you start trying to evaluate whether it s a good option for your both 5 x research source once your spouse has gotten over the initial shock start asking questions to determine what your spouse is feeling and thinking such as so what do you think do you think it s a good idea it may be that your spouse is on the same page thinking time apart would do you good but your partner may not want that all discuss goals that is you both have things you ll need from each other to make your marriage work if you ve done you re homework you already have some ideas of what you need from your partner but your partner will also have some for you 6 x research source remember these goals need to be concrete and specific for instance be less distant is not concrete enough check in with me at least 2 times a day is more specific be open to hearing what your partner needs as well each of you should have 3 to 4 goals for the other person agree that both of you will work on the goals without resorting to looking over the other person s shoulder that is you can t blame not achieving your goals on the other person not achieving theirs decide on ground rules once you ve had the conversation about the separation you need to have another about the rules of the separation you need to decide whether you re going to live apart how the bills are going to get paid and who s going to do what with the kids 7 x research source you should also discuss whether dating is allowed and how far you can go on a date for instance if you expect to get back together you may decide to rule out dating or sex these rules will need to be very specific for instance if you re talking about who gets to spend what time with the kids you need to lay out what days and nights of the week the kids will spend with each party remember that the ground rules you set for a separation may affect what happens if you get a divorce such as custody arrangements for instance if your kids are mostly living with one parent or the other that parent may be granted primary custody talk to a lawyer to make sure that your ground rules are fair to both of you and your kids you may need some help laying out these ground rules if you expect to get back together you re going to both need to compromise on the rules also put your rules in writing doing so can make sure everyone is on the same page 8 x research source don t let it drag on together set a time limit for your separation it could be 3 months half a year or a full year after you ve set a limit on how long your separation will be you can decide to let it go for longer however you don t want to keep dragging it out if you keep asking for more time over and over it may be that it s just time to end the marriage if neither of you are willing to fight for the relationship anymore it may not be worth it 9 x research source consider a therapist if you re having enough trouble to want a separation a third party mediator such as a therapist can help a therapist will help you to discuss your problems without getting so heated and hopefully work on finding common ground a therapist will expect both of you to be emotionally present working hard to put your relationship first 10 x research source ask around for recommendations for a couple s therapist from friends you trust more than likely some of your friends have had problems too and may have seen someone who s good for you and your spouse too a therapist can be objective about your relationship whereas it s harder for the two of you to be objective about something that you are both so emotionally invested in therefore suggest to your partner that you consider going to a therapist another option for a mediator is a pastor you could say given all i ve said about a separation i think it s important that we talk to a mediator i was thinking we could talk to a couple s therapist once a week to see if they can help us sort out some of our problems i really want to make this work but i do think we could use some outside help get a lawyer a lawyer is also important when you re separating once again it s good to ask your friends who ve been through a divorce if they have any recommendations for lawyers a lawyer will go over the legal ramifications of your separation so you know what to expect if you do get a divorce in addition your lawyer can act as a mediator for you if you need one 11 x research source you can also look up reviews of lawyers online to find one that most people have been happy with meet with the lawyer before deciding to engage him or her as your personal lawyer ask the lawyer if they re willing to act as a mediator if you need it and how often they ve worked with people on a trial separation plus you want to make sure you connect with your lawyer and trust him or her as a person as noted in the step about laying out ground rules it s important to remember that what you do in your separation can affect your divorce what you decide about who takes care of the kids now for instance can be used to decide who gets custody of your kids continue to talk if you have a trial separation without spending any time talking you won t be able to work through your problems if you really want to get back together you re going to need to spend time talking through your problems preferably with a third party 12 x research source for instance you could try talking on the phone twice a week consider addressing specific issues each time you talk talking on the phone cuts out some of the emotional charge in the situation if you re really emotional you may want to start with emails and the move up to phone calls if you ve engaged a therapist or you re visiting with a pastor that can be one way you can continue to connect with each other keep it to yourself of course telling your close friends and family that you ve separated is appropriate however now isn t the time to post a huge announcement on social media you are trying to decide if things will work out and having the whole world or at least all your friends including the person you never liked from high school weigh in isn t going to help what happens going forward should be between you and your spouse and possibly a good therapist 13 x research source sort out your feelings you re obviously feeling like something is wrong with the relationship however you need to be able to put your finger on why not just put it in general terms that needs you need to spend some time thinking about what you think has gone wrong with the relationship 14 x research source some areas you can think about are whether you still have fun together and laugh and whether you still have similar goals sex is also an area that can cause problems another area you can look at is the way you communicate has communication broken down in your marriage can you identify where it started breaking it down also consider the ways you care for each other happy couples enjoy doing things for each other if you find you are doing all the work in the relationship both the emotional work and the physical work of living together that could a large part of the problem your spouse isn t holding up her or his end of the marriage be able to lay it out in concrete terms that is you have figured out why you re unhappy to be fair to your spouse you need to be able to lay out in exact terms what s not working for you the best way to do that once you figure out what s wrong is to give concrete goals and ask for the same in return 15 x research source for instance maybe you re unhappy because you don t feel like your spouse pays attention to you anymore a concrete goal would be to spend alone time together at least twice a week come up with 3 to 4 concrete goals that you can discuss with your spouse 16 x research source decide what you want from the separation that is are you almost certain you will get a divorce after the separation that s something you need to be up front about however if you really want a separation to help you decide if you still want to be in the relationship it s okay to bring that to the table too 17 x research source have a time frame in mind in many cases couples who have a trial separation set a certain time frame when that time frame is up the couple either decides to get back together or to divorce one therapist recommends 3 months as a good time frame but you should have a time frame in mind when you talk to your spouse along with a good justification for that amount of time 18 x research source for instance you might feel like half a year is better to figure out your feelings alternatively you may want to separate for 3 months to give your spouse a chance to go through rehab if they don t you may choose to divorce at the end of that period of course you can reevaluate after the time period if you re both still unsure you
