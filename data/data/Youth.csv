give your emotions one week to cool off before making any big decisions often we let our emotions make decisions for us when we think we re being rational this can be a good thing but sometimes it s bad because we trick ourselves into thinking that we re being rational to let your emotions cool off and really give yourself time to think about your possible life changing decision wait a week before doing anything reach out to people you can trust and perhaps talk it over with them after a week your rational brain will probably have had time to make a decision this is different for each case and so you should weigh the consequences for running away if your parents were to find you some parents get mad at you instead of trying to help you 6 x research source plan ahead think of what you will do if any part of your plan goes wrong and make up excuses for everything here are some things that you always need to consider what will you do if you get sick what will you do if you are caught what will you eat how will you maintain good hygiene how will you stay off the streets and out of harm s way how will you earn enough money to survive try to find a safe place to stay with someone you can trust if you have someone who s helping you run away and can stay with them at least for a little while you re pretty much set however if that s not a possibility where will you take shelter pack up a bag with some essentials travel light bring only the bare essentials now is not the time to set a record for pounds carried bring food money extra changes of clothing a jacket or coat in case it gets cold clothes with pockets a toothbrush toothpaste soap shampoo and anything else you will need if you don t want to be recognized take with you only the clothes you wear least often some other things that might be useful in your quest utility knife maps umbrella combination lock blanket a jacket try to bring some of your allowance but don t take enough to get you noticed maybe 10 for a bus or other transportation and 50 just in case if you plan to steal the money find a place where you can get it fast without being spotted by your parents if you have a credit card definitely take that as it s much harder to steal and use and you can cancel it at any time be prepared for your parents to possibly cancel it however when they find out that you ve run away don t use it as your only source of money also using a credit debit card can give away your hiding place the bank can track down your card and see what stores and shops to which you ve been also the same with cell phones they can track your location you need to be aware of these things and use them wisely wait until you have the right opportunity to make a run for it make sure you have plenty of time to get away before anyone notices you re gone try making your move as soon as you get to school in the morning or as soon as everyone in your home leaves and you know they won t be coming back for a long time when you do book it make it snappy the last thing you want is for anyone in the neighborhood to notice you leaving find a method of transportation you will likely want to have a quick and easy way of getting around the city bus is your best bet or a long distance traveling bus if you re leaving the town city make up a story you ll have to accept that at some point someone is going to want to know where you came from or what you are doing you re probably going to need to do some thinking about this think of something reasonable and realistic but don t say you ran away keep it simple you ll want to remember it everywhere you go because word gets out quite fast in this world about anything so you should probably keep your story the same all throughout your life as a runaway just to avoid arousing suspicion avoid inconsistencies by thinking out the details ahead of time if you are really serious about running away permanently change your name have fun with it but don t choose anything too wacky but think about it something common would probably be best because it ll be harder to remember and your main aim is not to become too well known live near large grocery stores or candy stores these places will usually have food samples open to the public which you can snack on though make sure you take a cart with you and try to look like you have a purpose don t hang around also you can use the public bathrooms to wash yourself and do your business it s not glamorous but you can always go dumpster diving at the back of large grocery stores you ll be seriously surprised about what people throw away the more you dumpster dive the more your system will get used to food that s past its prime in the beginning it might be quite uncomfortable but it should get better find shelter if you haven t if you don t have a place to stay you ll have to find shelter elsewhere try finding a reasonably safe spot under a bridge in an alcove in an abandoned building somewhere or perhaps in a public building that stays open 24 7 if these don t work out try looking for the nearest homeless shelter and check their availability if you just need a place to stay in order to pass the time public libraries churches college buildings airports and train stations are all possible options these places are safe while generally having enough people about to make it easy for you to go unnoticed in the winter months you may want to try to find a building with an elevator if you are in a downtown area try climbing the stairs next to an elevator shaft all the way to the top you may find a room that is nice and warm that not too many people go into stay away from the woods or the desert these places are generally very rural and make it easier for other people to victimize you as romantic as it may seem it s really hard to make a living off of the land nowadays especially if you know nothing about plant and animal species try to find places with other people around they re usually safer you ll probably begin to need money at some point so learn how to panhandle panhandling is asking other people for money there s not much pride in it and many people will flat out ignore you but with the right strategies you could be quite successful and maybe even get enough to save some money choose the right location find a busy place where people walk such as outside a mall area a convenience store or a place where people come out with change ask patrons for money after they come out of the store not before alternatively ask drivers for money on a busy intersection make sure you re on the left side of the car where the driver s side is smile and ask people for change politely and softly you won t get very much money if you look mean or frustrated or unhappy when someone does give you money thank them with a smile and a friendly remark don t use the foreign accent ploy some people find faking a foreign accent tempting but this is typically a bad idea a foreign accent draws attention to yourself people will want to know more about you and your culture when you should really be trying to be as invisible as possible moreover faking an accent is extremely difficult it doesn t matter how good you think your foreign accent is it matters how much everyone else does maintain yourself this part is by far the hardest particularly maintaining a healthy diet and a good hygiene hospitals are known to keep exceptionally clean restrooms and offer good privacy here are some other tips that you can use to keep your hygiene high even if your spirits are low use bathrooms in big grocery stores there s not much privacy but there s very little foot traffic think about it how often do you use the restroom in a grocery store you ll probably be able to give yourself a nice little hand bath here and use some of the free soap provided use generic sex lube for shaving and straightening out hair it sounds weird but it works put a dab of lube on your skin and work it in gently with a bit of water shave up being careful to wash the razor out immediately if you need to straighten or tame your hair in the morning a little bit works wonders and it doesn t look noticeable afterwards shower at public swimming pools as well as colleges and universities if you pretend to be a student colleges often won t ask you to show your id this won t work all the time but it s worth the try especially if you trick a regular into believing you belong there decide what happens when you run out of food come up with a plan and if you run out of suitable options consider returning home or if you re really true about running away try to start a new life get a job some shelter no matter how bad all you need is protection from the weather and some friends in your new city or town control any desperation productively when you re down on your luck and you have nowhere else to turn you can begin to feel pretty desperate try to control that emotion instead of letting it push you to do rash things get some good food into your stomach even if it means spending every penny you have take a deep breath even if it feels like wasting time think back to a time when you felt powerful and resourceful ready to take on the world control your desperation by controlling your attitude there is no problem that can t be tackled by a little bit of imagination and pluck avoid hitchhiking keep in mind if you do decide to hitchhike that there are drivers that will do some bad things to you they could abandon you or even hurt you however on the flip side there are also really nice people out there who would gladly take you with them it s all about reading the driver and making a decision try to hitch rides with a nice lady a family with several children or a car with passengers they will probably want to ask you where you are going or what you are doing so have a nice little lie handy do not tell them that you ran away from home and say as little to them as possible if a sketchy or scary looking person offers to give you a ride ask them where they re going first when they answer tell them you re going to a different place preferably far away if they say that they can take you there politely refuse and cut off communication after that wait for them to drive off protect yourself if you are in a big city with many people know that there are likely people who could pose a threat to you bring something with which you can defend yourself such as pepper spray cleaning chemicals or perfume because perfume contains chemicals which can cause blindness being aware of dangers and avoiding them is usually better than having to confront them however walk away from people who pose a threat to you stand upright and tall and keep your composure but don t argue or aggravate them try to get to a public well lit area where there are a lot of people there s usually strength in numbers don t get pulled into prostitution don t let anyone do anything to you that you are uncomfortable with and if you get desperate enough that you feel you need to resort to this seek help local charities and churches will help you without asking too many questions prostitution is a common outcome of running away actually a study showed that one in four of runaways both boys and girls were victims of trafficking or used sex to get things like food and shelter 7 x research source because of the high chance of prostitution and also because of the poor sanitation conditions runaways are significantly more likely to get hiv aids be very careful avoid drugs and alcohol homeless youth are significantly more likely to fall into drug and or alcohol use this can lead to diseases like hiv aids or even death from overdose this is just aside from the other side effects of drug and or alcohol use be careful and do not use drugs no matter how bad you feel try to avoid getting arrested homeless people are much more likely to be arrested usually for being a nuisance loitering or trespassing you want to avoid having to spend a lot of time in jail so be careful where you go and how you look and act be careful around the other homeless people many people are homeless because they just hit some hard times and these people can be perfectly wonderful but there are also a lot of homeless people that are very desperate or mentally unstable especially in the us where mental health care is notoriously inadequate many mentally ill people end up on the streets these people can be dangerous and may attack you for no reason try to avoid being around other homeless people to keep yourself safe,Youth

in the middle of a concert and shout i love your singing you can wait until a good moment e g after the concert or tell other people about your thought people always feel happy when they learn you ve been saying good things about them behind their back look for the best in everyone everybody has positive traits so look for them in each new person you meet treat them with the assumption that they are well meaning and intelligent in their own way they may just rise to meet your expectations keep doing this and you will be a ray of sunshine that inspires others to be their best a few people are mean and rude no matter what you do keep a safe distance from these people and continue being positive it may rub off on them or it may not treat everyone with respect including those who are different from you it can be tempting to write people off as weird stupid or stuck up don t everyone has a story and is struggling in a way that you might not notice treat everyone like they are good at heart be respectful to everyone including the people you don t like they may warm up to you be polite courtesy will show others that you are considerate and mature use the phrases please thank you and may i let other people go first get a book on everyday etiquette or ask someone who appears to be particularly knowledgeable on it practice patience when you don t understand people may say things that don t make sense to you but they probably have a good reason instead of giving up or getting mad at them ask questions this works in a variety of perplexing situations from a person who is acting strange to someone who is being mean that s interesting why would you say ask do that i don t understand could you explain it i m surprised that an educated and considerate person like you would stereotype transgender people like that compliments can defuse rude behavior leave or defuse the situation if there s an argument nobody can truly win an argument calm yourself down or excuse yourself if you don t think you can handle it calmly you can always continue the discussion later when you have a cooler head i need to take a break i don t know how to respond to that i m so upset i don t know how to handle this i m going to take some quiet time surround yourself with people who make you feel happy you won t get along perfectly with everyone and that s okay spend your time and energy on the people who build you up and make you feel good they can help you feel happy and remind you of the person you want to be you re allowed not to be best friends with everyone if you feel upset when you re around someone be polite to them and focus your attention elsewhere be mindful about your romantic relationships a good girl doesn t rush into romance and makes sure that she is ready before trying something new communicate with your partner and talk about kissing and intimate touching before you do them learn how to say no an i don t want to not tonight i m not ready for that or just plain no makes it clear to your partner how you feel learn to recognize danger signals some people are disrespectful they push your boundaries laugh off your discomfort or worries or trash talk

kind words sometimes so they know how much you care,Youth

shapes and sizes and if you re tall you should be proud of your long legs and beautiful looks here s how to know if you re tall and how to make the most of it,see if you re taller than most of the girls you know if you re standing around a group of your friends and you re towering over them then yeah you re tall check out a photo of you and your friends and see where you stack up if you re a head above the rest of your friends then yep you re probably tall but remember that it also depends on who you hang out with you won t look so tall if you re hanging out with members of the volleyball team instead of regular girls see if you have a hard time finding clothes that fit you if you regularly have a hard time finding pants that fit you because they are always too short then yeah you re tall you may even hear your girlfriends complaining about always having to hem their pants because they are too long and may wonder what the heck they are talking about you may also have a hard time finding shirts that don t look like belly shirts when you put them on 1 x research source as for shorts if you re tall then it may be hard for you to find shorts that cover much of your legs if your school has a dress code where your fingertips have to reach the bottom of your shorts it may be nearly impossible for you to find a pair of shorts that is long enough see if everyone around you asks if you play basketball or volleyball if everyone around you asks if you play these tall girl sports then it may be a sign that you are taller than average this can be annoying if you don t actually play those sports or any sports at all people love to assume things about others because of their looks and you shouldn t get too discouraged by this see if you re taller than 5 6 though this

people in general girls hit puberty between the ages of 8 13 and boys hit puberty between the ages of 9 15 this means that if you feel tall but you re only 11 you may just be developing faster than a lot of your girl friends and may be taller than the boys around you who will take a bit longer to catch up if you re still in the midst of puberty and many of your friends haven t hit puberty yet then don t worry in a year or two you ll be surprised by how quickly you stop feeling like the tall girl see if you can never blend in when you re in a crowd if you re in a room full of people and your friends can spot you right away from across the crowded space then yeah it may be because you re so tall that you stand out easily there s nothing wrong with that who says that standing out is a bad thing see if you never have enough legroom whether you re sitting on a plane or in the passenger seat of your friend s car if you always feel like you have to move your legs to one side recline the seat or just contort your body to get your feet on the ground then you may be a tall girl see if you tower over most of the guys your age if those middle school or high school dances are awkward because any guy you dance with is just short enough to be eye level with your chest when it s time to sway to a slow song then yeah you re a tall girl but don t be discouraged there s a good chance that a lot of the guys you know haven t stopped growing yet see if you feel guilty for always blocking everyone s view when you go to a concert or the movies you can t help being tall but still you find yourself feeling guilty whenever you go to a concert or the movies because you just know that the person behind you can t see a thing there s not much you can do about it except slouch in your seat if this sounds like you then you re probably a tall girl remember that tall is beautiful and hey so is being short don t think that being tall means you have to be gangly awkward or unappealing

intimidated by you because you re so tall but that doesn t mean you can t talk to them or show them how awesome you are don t think that you have no chance with a guy just because he s shorter than

yourself is so important don t let ego and status stop you from treating others as you would your own brothers and sisters don t be close minded love all people of all religions races sexual orientations and beliefs don t swear or speak about inappropriate things or make intolerant statements you can t make a positive difference if you are cursing or making dirty jokes be respectful

others jesus showed love to people who were treated negatively by others or regarded lowly by society never give up on someone and especially never give up on god in the good times and the bad you

take root within others you have the relationships with the people around you already and you can be the one who encourages them offers prayers and lives out the bible so as to be an example of god s love and grace treat everyone as an equal whatever their status in life or profession remember that all people are god s creation and deserve a chance to be understood be able to take rejection or

s difficult for others to see the positive change caused by your faith read the bible you could try to read a scripture a day god s word is vital to a christian life because it provides guidelines you could also listen to podcasts or watch youtube videos on your faith ask questions you won t know everything there are many christians who have studied faith for their whole lives but they still don t know everything keep in mind that historical context language translation context or meaning can matter when reading christian teachings seek out older religious teachers and show them great respect such as a pastor or priest or a sunday school teacher ask them to help you learn more about your faith make sure that you keep involved in a bible study preferably involving kids your age this is much more effective in helping you learn and relate to the bible than attending only traditional worship services pray as often as you can and go to church you can simply start off by saying god i do not know what to do but i have this desire in my heart to make a difference god doesn t care what you say to him he just loves to listen to you 6 x research source you could start a prayer journal so that you can remember what you prayed for and then see how god has answered your prayers don t forget to pray for others too not just for yourself you should attend church as much as you can and ask your parents if they can drive you try memorizing some important prayers and saying them before you go to bed and every meal just take time out of your day to relax and think about god what are you thankful for and what you did wrong and could improve ask god what to do through prayer god knows all your abilities strengths and weaknesses and he knows what s right for you to do to make a difference don t let your age or comfort zones get in the way of doing what god calls you to do lead a fundraiser to help someone in need maybe you start out by collecting spare change or donating your allowance find a worthy cause and help collect donations for it or just give whatever money you have to a good cause 7 x research source you could use an online donation site you can also help by joining or helping a cause that revolves around helping people know about god and his word there are many organizations that cater to the needs of less fortunate people all across the world as well as teach them about christ perhaps you do car washes or lemonade stands sell your old books it s not necessarily how much you donate that counts it s the fact you re giving most or all of what you have that matters join a youth group or mission this is another way that you can give back by getting involved with group activities associated with your church try to get involved in your local church s mission trips whether they are around the world national or local if your church does not have these types of trips you could bring the idea to the congregation 8 x research source try tithing giving 10 of your money to your church or donating some of the stuff you don t use anymore inviting your friends to church or youth group are great ideas too don t treat youth group like school and don t act like it bores you dedicate yourself to god and show this by always staying happy and cheerful and giving what you can to the group you could also start join a christian club at your school if it s allowed remember that a mission doesn t have to be across an ocean you could go on a mission trip to a local college or high school and help out staff with some church friends and talk about jesus to anyone willing to listen be open about your faith and principles at times this might be very difficult you might feel like the only christian youth around who is open about faith stand your ground actively develop your relationship with christ get out and interact with people and develop relationships christian youth are ambassadors not secret agents in order to change people s hearts you first need to interact with them be as outward as possible about your faith you could wear shirts that spark conversations stand up for and voice your moral beliefs you can do this in a way that sounds positive not negative be willing to stand up for what you believe in be a witness to what god has done for you as a christian a lot of young people have some little or absolutely no faith in god whatsoever by being walking proof about what the word has to offer you are making a difference somewhere give back by volunteering your time you could help the homeless take care of an elderly or disabled person or work at an animal shelter help at your church school and in your home too you can also give back in smaller ways by simply being a positive force in your environment help classmates with schoolwork out of class for example you can organize park cleanups or volunteer for blood drives help your church basically just volunteer to help your church it could be something as simple as holding the door for people visiting your church you could offer to clean up after the services share your faith if you think it will help others this doesn t mean that you try to push your beliefs on others however if someone asks you about what keeps you strong in all you do gently tell them you believe in god and you put all your worries fears pain onto god so that you can help others with theirs also don t be afraid to share your testimony talk to your youth minister pastor about opportunities to share your story and where you can help within the church the important thing to remember is that simply letting people know you are a christian can sometimes be enough as long as you are happy and friendly and don t force anything down anyone s throat it s a good idea to let more people know that god has their back if you perceive that a person is struggling and receptive to the message however understand that being a christian is not about beating out other religions christianity is a peaceful and loving religion learn to love the people around you for who they are and that you cannot change them by shoving a bible down their throat if you want to show how christianity has made you a better person be kind to those around you regardless of their beliefs,Youth

how to be a normal teenager,when you re a teenager there is not one way to be normal it depends on your interests likes and dislikes all teens experience a range of different emotions and experiences up to and including joining or avoiding groups feeling alienated or inclusive bored having fun physical changes you may experience an intense desire to fit in with some group to be accepted by your peers of similar age level and interests even self proclaimed weirdos who celebrate their individuality have like minded friends it s normal to feel like you re not normal enough we all want to fit in somewhere and fitting in doesn t mean you have to become a mindless drone with a relentless drive to conform embrace your inner weirdness and become the truest version of yourself that s normal,spend time with people who are doing positive activities that you want to do it s getting increasingly easy to spend too much time alone while some solitude can be good even loners have to come out to work play or eat sometimes to act normally and behave in a well adjusted manner not too different it s important to spend time around other people socializing and learning from them so you can interact more directly and easily get involved just being around a variety of people in a coffee shop or at a restaurant or at the movies can help you learn about others and feel less isolated this will make you more comfortable in your own skin which in turn will make you more experienced at opening up and interacting find places where you re likely to run into like minded people love comics quit buying them online and hit up your local comic shop love to make art head to an art class craft store or the museum take a class in one of your interests and talk some with others learning the same topic or skill get in a choir or take music lessons some churches have music school and sport activities online friends exist in a gray area they re real a lot of the time but our interactions online are much different than our up close mano a mano interactions try to balance your time socializing online with at least as much if not more face to face interactions be happier by not hanging around people who act out in negative too wild or crazy ways having a pessimistic excitable or silly friend is fine but if being around them makes you uncomfortable consider whether you should keep them as a friend

something offer up your help to those who may need it when asked for give your opinion or assistance don t go looking for trouble let it come to you and try to stay out of it pay attention to the body language of others when you re around people keep an eye out for any clues they might give regarding how to behave normally in situations mirror the behavior of others if it makes you comfortable when you re in the library and everyone looks very studious quiet and absorbed in their work it s probably not the best time to start cutting up and trying to make jokes if everyone s dancing at a school dance it might be normal to dance but you don t have to it s normal to feel both ways if your neighbor at the lunch table keeps trying to make eye contact and smiles continuously at you it s probably a good time for a conversation if you feel open try being friendly available communicating people often have open posture shoulders back head up not too relaxed relaxing but not acting open may be about instead acting tired sleepy angry shy or grumpy arms and legs crossed may be a sign that they are satisfied to sit alone not looking to be friendly learn to recognize and not act that way in your own interactions if people are uncommunicative or closed off to you head down arms crossed they probably don t want to talk if you press the issue it s possible that you might make them feel uncomfortable learn to recognize this and disengage from the conversation or interaction give them some space be a good listener and wait for your turn to speak when you re talking with someone or with a group of people try to balance listening and talking in equal measure you don t have to be the one to contribute the most if you want to be noticed it s just as important to be an active listener look at the person who s talking nod your head to show that you re listening and really listen to what is being said 1 x research source stay on topic if everyone in a group is going around telling stories about their weekend tell a story about your weekend if you have one it would be kind of strange to break the spirit of the moment i had to watch my dad eat pickled herring he eats weird stuff all the time hopefully that s not really about your weekend don t hijack a conversation and take it elsewhere or else expect groans and protests at your sense of humor breaking the line of thought unless it s time to change the topic listening doesn t mean looking across the room or thinking of what you re going to say until a moment of silence appears in a conversation for you to fill however listening means actively receiving and responding to what the other is saying nicely not just trying to think of what you re going to say next to top that bit accept the others points as worthwhile even if you ve heard it already then without a yawn or cut down say hey yeah excellent point that s true but have you ever been to done this ___ 2 x research source draw your personal boundaries a teenager is an individual who wants to be seen as mature and experienced as one s peers due to this while you strive to become the best you it can often be tempting to get pushed or pulled into things you might not be ready for or even interested in smoking drinking experimenting with the thrills of asking for dates actually going on dates when parents permit holding hands hugging kissing and deciding your approach to love expressing your new found state of being a teen balancing all these aspects is what normal teenagers confront in their everyday lives while there s not just one set way to approach each of these aspects what you should know is that it s your decision to stand for your values beliefs and to accept your responsibility to understand the consequences of conduct and behavior in close relationships it s your life make your choices the right ones to draw your best boundaries close to your heart the closer you set your daily life boundaries to your present norms and accepted truths where you re coming from the sooner you can be well adjusted in your way you ll be able to avoid other way out freaky or boring stuff and be able to expand and extend your near boundaries launching out near your everyday unusual stuff keep it real keep it simple is easier than going off track or out into the far off unknown wanting to fit in is normal and it s true that engaging in risky behaviors seems like a way to fit in and get people to respect you but why would you compromise your personality and beliefs if you re not being yourself it s not you they re respecting or even noticing keep it cool another good boundary to keep in mind is secrecy it s okay to keep some things to yourself it s almost too easy to put every event success and failure every frustration anger and joy up on facebook as a status update does it all really need to be there for everyone to see and dis you you give the answer make your room an awesome sanctuary for a teenager there s nothing more critical than having a space all to your own make your room as unique as you are filled with posters or candles records or drawings fill it with yourself paint it whatever color you want and fill it with things you like to look at take some time thinking about what would make the ideal room and get permission to make it that way if you don t have your own room find somewhere

and khaki pants look good you re in safe waters the important normal constant is that whatever you wear is clean and form fitting 3 x research source learn some about contemporary fashion it s a good idea to pay attention to what other kids are wearing not because you must conform and wear the same thing but so you can at least have some concept of the average dress wear then if you choose to go in another direction you ll be aware of what you re doing and not end up wearing plaid grandpa pants and golfing shoes to school because you think it s normal you don t have to go to expensive stores to dress normally box stores like target walmart and other outlets usually have sale items that are affordable and current at thrift stores try to find the newest cleanest clothes available that are in your size in middle school especially it can seem that all anyone cares about is getting the next must have clothes trend which are usually expensive and will be forgotten in another six months

express yourself being a teen is a time of experimenting trying on new identities until you learn which one fits you the best in a given year you might switch back and forth between thinking you want to be a doctor and loving your position on the soccer team to wanting nothing but to write poetry and hang out with painters and paint your fingernails black that s ok that s normal try out being an art kid take some art classes and learn the fundamentals to see you if you d like to spend your days in the studio creating strange masterpieces try out the exciting world of mystery lots of teenagers

well hang out in school and outside of school support each other and lift each other up emphasize forging a few strong relationships over lots of meaningless ones it s not worth having 800 facebook friends if you can t talk to any of them in real life alternatively it s also a good idea to meet lots of people who you don t necessarily have a lot in common with if you re a sporty athlete hang out with some of the art kids every now and then to see what you have in common try to make all sorts of different friends make room in your life for school and work having fun is important but taking

example moving from simple writing to writing poetry or literature don t be afraid to try new things it s never too late to check out a new interest and who knows maybe you ll even find your life passion by doing so consider balancing your interests so that you have a wide variety for example if your biggest hobby is computer programming maybe try a more art oriented hobby like painting or learn a language just because you re a tech nerd or an art geek doesn t mean your interests have to stick firmly in that area it s boring to have interests that are only in one area explore your style and your interests now is the time to experiment don t feel the need to stick to just one niche from fashion to hobbies to music and movies you can explore all kinds of possible interests don t feel bound by tradition or labels if you like to dress like someone who likes rock music and you really love country music that s fine do what you enjoy let go of your prejudices even if you think you re not prejudiced sometimes negative thoughts about groups of people can root in your mind buried prejudices against religious groups racial groups lgbt groups and so on can taint your ability to see the world clearly let go of these nobody is exactly like a stereotype and seeing groups of people as just like those other ones inhibits knowing people for who they truly are work on your work ethic yes

nerds do find it enjoyable you don t have to be an all a s student that s taking only honors or ap level classes but you should at least do your best to pass the classes you re in avoid slacking off as this hurts your grades don t rush on your homework because you want to hang out with friends work on it to learn new things a largely forgotten fact is that school is meant for learning not trapping you in a classroom for a few hours each day avoid rushing to figure out who you are your teenage years are hectic ever changing and chances are your interests will constantly shift and change

what you are at your age anyone who tells you that you need to figure out what college you re going to or what you plan for the future is wrong even if you think you ve decided on what you re going to do don t be surprised if your plans change you never know where life is going to take you work to improve your social skills some teens have trouble with social interaction with the reasons behind it varying since social interaction is necessary in order to succeed it s important to learn how to cope with shyness and social anxiety consider working with a friend or a family member of close age to

with disabilities can be charming in unique ways especially if you work on being kind and developing good habits refuse to judge people for harmless traits while you may feel tempted to write someone off as annoying or difficult this can result in you judging them unfairly work on being accepting and patient when someone is different in ways you don t expect keep in mind that there may be something going on that you don t know about a clingy guy may have been abandoned by a parent during childhood a hyper girl may have adhd and be struggling to keep friendships try to be understanding remember that just because you ve had a bad experience with a person doesn t mean that they re a bad person be polite towards others including people you don t know well every day you ll likely see people you don t know whether it be in school or out in public it may seem funny to make fun of those that you don t know but it s rude and word will probably get back to them eventually later in life you ll have to work with people you don t know it s best to be polite towards strangers if you can manage it be friendly as well it s appreciated by those around you even if you don t see it don t laugh at people when they make mistakes like dropping or spilling things instead offer help this can help turn around a bad day even if they don t show their appreciation outright find a few good friends you don t need to be at the top of the social food chain and know everybody at school but you should at least try to have a few loyal friends throughout your teenage years friendships are a

friends who make you feel good and inspire you to be your best hang out with friends you really like and worry less about maintaining relationships with people who don t improve your life friends come and go and you may have different types and numbers of friends that s okay how many friends you have isn t important it s the quality of the friends you do have that matters as cliché as that sounds if you struggle to find friends try looking in areas where people are similar to you are you lgbt for example see if there s a teen lgbt group in your city or if your school has a gsa that you could join if you prefer writing over socializing see if you can find writer s groups if you re autistic try seeking out other autistic people to befriend try going on social media if you can t find friends face to face however be very careful with this online friendships develop much differently than face to face friendships and many people online are not who they say they are you never know what goes on behind the screen sometimes it may not be even an actual human you are talking to exercise caution when making friends online and never agree to meet up with somebody in private avoid giving out personal information to people you meet online unless you are sure that they can be trusted it is best to meet people in real life first before meeting them on the internet take romance slowly some but not all teens are interested in romantic relationships and may want to find a partner if you get into a relationship take it slowly and communicate with your partner well this leads to the healthiest relationships in the long run you don t need to be tethered to your partner either make sure the relationship allows the both of you to have your own friends and interests you don t need to rush into anything before you re ready 5 x research source make peace with things when a relationship doesn t work out it s normal for it to hurt for a while remember that just because the relationship wasn t right doesn t mean that you re a bad person sometimes two people are just a bad fit and if you did do something wrong you can learn from it for next time it can be okay be wary of abusive relationships if you feel like you have to constantly walk on eggshells around your partner to try and avoid them getting angry at you or hitting you or if you can t talk to anybody else without your partner accusing you of cheating these are huge red flags that the relationship is unhealthy and that you need to get out of it the same applies for toxic friendships keep good relations with your family as much as possible 6 x research source family members especially parents probably worry about you during your teenage years many teenagers become sullen withdrawn and stop valuing family as much as they used to try to avoid this family is one of the most important connections in your life it s the building blocks for all relationships you develop whether they re friendships romantic relationships or a family that you choose to have later on in life and plus you see them every day why not make it nice to spend time with them you don t have to be best friends with everyone in your family but be kind to them and spend time with them once in a while play a video game with your sister help your brother with his writing offer to go on a walk with your mom or play a board game with your dad don t just stay in your room all day and only see your family at meals improve your relationship with your siblings it s fine to argue and bicker with siblings here and there but remember that your sibling relationship is usually one of the longest in your life siblings can be great allies mentors and friends not just now but also when you re old and grey watch out for abusive family members your family can be some of the closest friends you have but they can also negatively impact your life if your parents constantly make you feel down they may be emotionally abusing you if your brother constantly hits you that s a sign of physical abuse usually talking things out with a close friend or confronting your abuser can lessen the hurt but know when to report child abuse keep close to your extended family such as your cousins too make an effort to spend time with them when you can you probably don t see your extended family often so take advantage of the time you do have to hang out with them consider volunteer work you may not be interested in volunteering or attaining a job that s okay helping out others is only a recommendation however many volunteers report that their work makes them feel good some volunteer work can even help with self development 7 x research source consider the benefits and drawbacks of volunteer work or jobs and use this to decide whether you ll help others out avoid thinking that you can t help anybody you don t have to get a job when you re a teenager and when you re under a certain age it s nearly impossible to find one but that doesn t mean that you re unable to help out consider volunteering doing odd jobs for others or helping someone to learn something they don t know this can do wonders to help other people it will be helpful for future employment after college to have a job or volunteer so you can have valuable work experience volunteering doesn t have to happen outside of the home if you have an internet connection you can volunteer online for example editing wikihow articles about your favorite subjects build off of your interests and talents are you interested in animals volunteer at an animal shelter or collect supplies for your local non profit shelter are you good with people find a job or volunteer work that s oriented around talking to others can you design complex web pages with minimal effort offer to help others learn web design take your talents and interests and find something you can do based around those it can be a great help to volunteer or work and have fun at the same time consider tutoring younger kids if one of your talents is that you re an all a s scholar see if there s a program at your school that allows you to tutor struggling students if not try asking families that have younger kids or advertising a tutoring service you may get some great opportunities it s okay to turn down a tutoring offer if you can t tutor the neighbor s son because he s too loud and disruptive or if you aren t good at a subject that somebody needs help with it s okay to politely say i m sorry i can t do that job or i don t think your child and i work together very well you can either choose to get paid for tutoring or do it for free if you do choose to make it a job however don t overcharge few people will hire you if you charge ten dollars an hour participate in fundraisers and activities for causes you support some organizations will host activities to donate to certain causes for example walks to support cancer research collect money and donate it to groups that do cancer research other activities seek to spread awareness of illnesses or acceptance of disabled people consider participating in these be sure you know what group the activity is supporting some groups are well known for being surrounded by controversy do careful research on an organization before participating in any of their events you don t want to support something that causes more harm than good do things that make others happy you don t need to participate in giant volunteer organizations to make a difference consider doing basic things to help people have a brighter day compliment your classmate s poem tell someone they look fantastic help somebody pick up their things if they drop them hold the door open for others who are struggling to carry things and so forth something that seems little to you can turn someone else s entire day around get out there and help to make the world a better place by making others lives more enjoyable,Youth

how to act at a girl s house,you are super excited that your girlfriend friend or crush has invited you over and suddenly the nervousness hits you whether meeting the family just spending quality time together or moving in for a longer period of time the number one rule is to be honest courteous and respectful,ask for a tour to get a lay of the land this is an especially good thing to do if you feel awkward or unsure what to do when you first arrive keep an eye out for decorations old pictures and music or book collections all excellent conversation starters and places to stop and chat let her take the lead on activities and fun more often than not she ll have some specific things she might want to show you or favorite activities around the house if she invites you over remember to be a good guest and let her be a good host if things are shy or awkward you can of course suggest things to do but try and step back and let her take the lead respecting her and her house before blurting out the things you want to do don t worry if there is some shy awkwardness early on this is normal it will pass help out with any chores or activities she has like cleaning dishes after a shared meal just because you re a guest doesn t mean you have to let her do all of the work if she s got some chores to do offer to lend a hand instead of flipping on the tv and zoning out until she s done think of it this way the faster chores are done the sooner you can hang out want to really impress her don t ask to help just start pitching in tackling the dishes while she mops grabbing clean towels changing the laundry when it beeps etc leave things how you found them never assume that it is no big deal just because you might leave the toilet seat up at your house don t use a coaster or leave books out on the counter when you re done with them assume her level of cleanliness not yours the best approach is to return things to their condition when you arrived allowing her to dictate what things are important and what things she doesn t mind you exploring or tampering with you don t have to act like you re in a museum just be courteous and don t leave a mess behind you make sure you re not creating more work than when you started if you don t know where the dishes go don t just start sticking them places to get them out of the way be respectful and honest with any romantic advances just because a girl invites you over is not an invitation into her bed this fact may seem obvious but it can be confusing if you re visiting for the first time and are unsure what she wants to do the best advice is to move slowly escalating romance one step at a time cuddling kissing making out etc instead of just assuming you ll be going all the way once you walk in the door like any other situation you should always ask for consent before moving on romantically or sexually talk about how long you ll be alone together if her parents or siblings are expected to walk through the door make sure you both know in advance talk about whether they are okay with you being there as well as the appropriate behavior when they arrive you should know for example if her parents don t want you together in her room talk to her about any important family information before you arrive you don t need an encyclopedia on the family but you should know if there are any topics to avoid around the dinner table be inquisitive what do her parents do what hobbies do they enjoy are there any special circumstances to be aware of showing you care enough to ask questions will make everyone s experience much smoother does she know any common ground you might have with her family or places where you might naturally find conversation is there anything you can bring as a small thank you gift while a bottle of wine is the classic choice it won t go over well if they don t drink or you re a minor offer to help do the dishes and aid with small tasks even if they refuse it is the thought that counts to be a truly considerate guest just start helping clear the table once dinner is over taking the initiative and showing your respect while you aren t there to become a temporary handyman just asking if you can lend a hand will go a long way 1 x research source keep physical contact pg rated but don t feel like you must avoid it completely it will look a little strange if you re suddenly distant with your girl while you don t want to be lewd holding her hand occasionally or putting an arm around her is a simple sweet way to show your affection check in with her if you think her family would frown on any physical contact if you re in doubt let her initiate anything and just follow her lead 2 x research source be yourself instead of trying to be a perfect partner you re going to be nervous or stressed and that is okay but don t convince yourself that you need to shape your behavior to become a perfect partner they don t exist mind your manners introduce yourself with a smile and firm handshake and then be yourself imagine you re meeting a professor or teacher for the first time or a new business contact instead of your potential in laws tell stories about yourself be honest about your goals and hopes and don t be afraid to crack a low key joke or two if it feels right stop second guessing every action and just be yourself 3 x research source embrace the culture and atmosphere of her family with an open mind if a new food is put in front of you try it with a smile when the family has a moment of prayer bow your head respectfully even if you don t share their faith your overriding principle is to just go with the flow you are being welcomed into their family so accept that invitation with open arms the more you learn about a girl s family the more you also learn about her this doesn t mean you need to lie or change your personal beliefs in order to fit in it simply means trying to listen and learn instead of making things about you 4 x research source help out with general house chores and maintenance if you re going to be a good house guest you need to help out around the house most importantly don t wait for her to ask you to do something if you notice it needs to be done staying with someone requires both sides to work together to keep the space happy and livable some chores to look out for include watering plants doing dishes washing sheets blankets and towels tending to pets vacuuming defer to her preferences when tending the house there are going to be some things that she likes a particular way even if they don t make sense to you maybe her spice rack is particularly organized for easy cooking or she likes the towels folded particularly everyone including you has little quirks and preferences for your living conditions so be sure to respect hers being considerate is not so much about the spice rack or the towels it is about understanding her personal space and preferences she likely has her things in very particular orders and places be respectful and ask questions when storing your own stuff you may have ways of doing things you may think are better or more logical but remember that this isn t your house at the end of the day her preferences for her stuff take priority 5 x research source discuss a fair way to split any expenses such as food early on if you re staying at her house you should be willing to help cover at least some of the expenses particularly food while she may have it covered she may also want to split rent or utilities depending on how long you ll be staying don t just assume that everything s good make a point to ask her about finances before unsaid arguments become a problem talking about money is never fun but it is essential to preserve a strong healthy relationship establish ground rules about any specific living quirks or desires maybe she needs a little quiet time when she gets home from work perhaps you both really like to shower before leaving but need to work out a way that you both have enough time the best way to handle these situations is to talk about them as they come up finding compromise early on instead of waiting until one of you is upset common things to cover include who does what chores or house maintenance tasks etiquette for inviting other people over for visits dinner hanging out etc your usual routines including sleep schedules and how to be respectful of them 6 x research source talk openly and honestly about any romantic expectations talking about romance may be the least romantic thing you can do but it is absolutely necessary whether you re sharing a bed with a partner or just friends living together sit down and talk about physical intimacy together early on if you re a couple think about how often you d like to be together and promise each other to be honest about your mood and feelings if one of you says no remind each other that is a firm no not something to be negotiated if you re just friends talk about when and how it is acceptable to bring someone home with you and the etiquette about dating and the house treat her house with respect not like your personal property staying with someone for a long time whether you re dating them or not tends to lead to some relaxed rules and ideas but just because you get comfortable in the house doesn t mean it is suddenly yours all of your basic manners still apply clean up any of your messes put things back where they belong and respect her rules and preferences and you should be more than okay how to act at a girl s house is about being a considerate kind person it s not rocket science keep in mind that you re in her house meaning your footprint is going to impact her directly if for example you know that she pays the water bill don t take 30 minute showers,Youth

them then even better don t gossip 13 x research source one way to avoid any kind of conflict is to not gossip whether you re gossiping about your teachers your classmates your friends in the neighborhood or even your cousins gossiping about other people only sends bad vibes and this will inevitably get back to people in the end you should focus on saying positive things about people even if nobody else is feeling very positive if you want to stay out of trouble 14 x research source if you re saying bad stuff about people it s more likely than not that it will eventually get back to them and if it does you may be in for some big trouble be careful on social media too you may trust people but later it come around and get you don t try to reason with unreasonable people 15 x research source one of the reasons you may be getting in trouble is because you find the need to defend or explain yourself to people who just aren t willing to listen if you and a kid in your gym class or down the street just don t get along then stay away resist the urge to set the record straight tell people why they re acting poorly or just to stick your head somewhere where it doesn t belong instead get as much distance between you and volatile or annoying people as possible and you ll be much more likely to stay out of trouble reasoning with people who don t want to hear it is guaranteed to get you nowhere fast it s a waste of both time and energy avoid fighting obviously if you re the kind of kid who always gets into fights then this is easier said than done but if you really want to stay out of trouble then you have to know how to walk away from a fight if someone is trying to provoke you calling you names or just getting all up in your face learn to take deep breaths walk away and keep your cool pouncing on those people getting hurt and getting sent to the principal s office or to your room is just no fun so the next time the opportunity to fight presents itself remind yourself that even if it may feel good to punch someone for a few seconds long term it ll only do you harm literally just walk away if someone is coming at you put your hands up and leave this does not make you a coward it makes you smart don t talk back to your teachers you won t be best friends with all of your teachers no matter how hard you try and there will always be a teacher or two that you just don t get along with even if you really disagree with everything your teacher is saying you should just be polite try to do the best you can and avoid any arguments that may arise if your teachers asks you to do something do it unless it s completely unreasonable this is not the time to look tough or to say what s really on your mind when you re in school it s time to be well behaved and to get on with your studies when you become an adult and start your own career path you can begin to question authority and the world around you a bit more openly but in the beginning you have to play the game be polite to everyone being kind and polite can go a long way in helping you stay out of trouble say please and thank you and be polite to everyone from a random neighbor who passes by you every morning to the crossing guard developing a habit of good manners and good social skills will help you throughout your life and it s a great way to keep yourself out of trouble if you re rude or mean to people you ll develop a reputation of being a bad seed and no one will be in your court when you are called into question 16 x research source this means be nice to your family members too don t think that they know you too well for you to really be polite around them take good care of yourself you may not think that getting enough rest eating three healthy meals and getting some form of exercise every day has anything to with staying out of trouble but you re wrong taking care of your body means you re taking care of your mind 17 x research source and if your

something rude to an adult without meaning to 18 x research source also if you re focusing on your own well being then you won t have time to cause trouble,Youth

is about her dating that is causing each emotion thinking deeply about your feelings can help you untangle them when you talk to your mom about what s bothering you you ll be able to express yourself more clearly 2 x research source sometimes it can be helpful to write down all the different emotions you are feeling to keep it all straight for example if you write down that you are feeling betrayed follow that thought what is it about your mom dating that makes you feel betrayed do you feel betrayed because you think she is trying to replace your dad and create a new family think about different outcomes what do you think will happen now that your mom has started dating try to imagine and work through different scenarios maybe she will meet someone and get married or maybe she will meet someone and get her heart broken what role do you play in each of those scenarios thinking through different scenarios can be a good way to feel like you have some control over the situation ultimately you really don t but it can be helpful to feel like you know what role you will play in several different scenarios talk to someone you trust dealing with this new situation can be really tough especially if you feel that you can t talk to your mom about what s going on instead talk to a friend or trusted family member about the situation tell them why it s bothering you they may be able to point out things you hadn t thought of or offer guidance 3 x research source it may be very helpful in this situation to get help from a professional counsellor who can help you understand what you re feeling avoid talking to your other parent about your mom s dating even if they already know about it it s unlikely that they ll be able to approach the subject without putting their own emotions into it recognize that you are not responsible for your mom s decisions when your mom is dating she may make choices that you believe to be poor ones she may go on dates with lots of different people she may stay out very late or she may date people that are obviously wrong for her however it is important to recognize and remember that she is an adult who is able to make decisions

and challenging time for her dating can be hard and emotionally draining try to remember this and be understanding of the situation although it may not feel like it sometimes you are the child in this relationship it is not your responsibility to keep your mom from making poor decisions or mistakes talk with your mom about how you feel it s important when you do this not to accuse your mom of neglecting you or not caring about you instead focus on talking to her about how you feel are you feeling scared that you ll lose her to someone maybe you re worried she will get hurt are you worried she is trying to replace your dad pinpoint exactly what you re feeling 4 x research source try to do this at a time when you are not fighting with your mom or angry about something otherwise you risk saying things you don t mean which may really hurt her feelings address your concerns when you are talking with your mom this will be the time to address any concerns you have about her decisions related to dating or about the person she is dating do this respectfully it may be helpful to say something like i know it is not my place to tell you what to do but i have noticed that hopefully this will help her see that you are only trying to look out for her even though it isn t your job for example if you notice that she often comes home sad after her dates point this out to her say something like mom i m trying my best to be understanding of this new chapter in your life but every time you come home from a date you seem less happy than when you left i just want to make sure that you are doing what makes you happy point out any changes you might like to see related to your relationship with her for example if you feel like she isn t spending enough time with you then say i understand that going on dates means you won t be home as often and that s ok but i also want to spend time with you can we schedule some time where it s just you and me doing something fun once you have talked about your concerns related to her dating leave it be it is ok to do this once to get it out in the open after that you should respect that your mom is an adult listen to what she has to say it is just as important to give your mom a chance to express her own feelings try to hear what is going on in your mom s life and why she wanted to start dating you may find for example that your mom has felt very lonely for a long time and that dating has made her feel happy and cared for if you are able to listen your mom will see that you aren t just trying to make everything difficult listening to your mom s feelings will also help make her feel like you care which will hopefully bring you closer together write her a letter if you feel as though talking to your mom will only end in a fight or that she won t listen to you try writing down all of your feelings in a letter as you would when talking to her try to be respectful and avoid accusing her of one thing or another just explain how you re feeling the advantage here is that it will give her plenty of time to read and re read your thoughts and will give her a chance to think about the best way to react to your feelings 5 x research source ask to spend time with her if you feel like your mom is spending too much time with her new love interest try asking her if you can spend some time alone together she may simply not realize that you want to spend time with her too she may have thought you d like to have your alone time ask if you guys can go see a movie together or make dinner together 6 x research source if she tells you that it is a great idea and that she will invite the new boyfriend along explain to her that you d really like to spend some time with just her if she asks why you want to spend time together in the first place just tell her that it s because you love her and you want to stay close with her avoid comparing your mom s new love interest to your other parent it can be easy to notice how her new partner is not as good as your other parent keep in mind though that they re not there to replace your other parent so it doesn t matter if they re the same or different 7 x research source instead try to notice the things that you really like about your mom s new partner maybe they like going outside and playing catch with you or maybe they treat your mom really well and it s apparent how happy they make your mom it s always a good plan to look for the qualities in other people rather than their flaws be supportive this is a tough one but if you are constantly fighting with your mom about her dating and telling her she shouldn t do it then there will be a lot of tension in your relationship if you can try to remind her that you love her very much and that you want her to be happy but that you also want to have your own time with her too if you like someone that she is dating tell her if you don t like them then just try to be polite you don t have to be best friends be open to the person she is dating remember that this person isn t there to replace your dad they are there because they care about your mom too you don t have to treat this person as you would your parent but treat them as you would any other adult that you have no reason to disrespect greet them when you see them and remember to say please and thank you when necessary 8 x research source if you give them a chance you might find that you like them more than you thought you would this can be scary and you might feel angry or resentful when you meet this person if you need to go to your room for a while to reflect on your encounter with the new person but try not to be rude avoid talking badly about the person your mom is dating to your other parent this can be tempting but try not to do it it isn t fair to your mom or the person she is dating and it may even be painful for your other parent to hear about it it may create even more tension between your parents as your dad may question your mom s ability to make her own decisions 9 x research source if you feel like you need to vent bad feelings about the person your mom is dating try writing all of it down in a journal or talking to someone such as a friend who is not involved in the situation,Youth

how to be a well rounded teenager,being a well rounded teenager is a balancing act imagine you re in a circus and riding a unicycle the ringmaster throws you one ball and then two then three and four which you re expected to juggle all at once while riding a unicycle it s tough stuff which is why so many people look for guidance during their teenage years if you want to take a hold of your life again and be the person you want to be here s some guidance,pay attention in class and get good grades school may seem boring but it is important to try to do well good grades will give you more options in the future make sure to jot down any homework or test deadlines when you get them so that you don t forget to complete them and prioritize your study deadlines when it is recommended to write notes from your classes write notes as this is one of the best ways for informing your revision before writing essays and sitting exams if there s something you don t understand ask somebody read it through carefully again and then if you still don t get it ask a friend or a teacher despite what people might imply there is never such a thing as a dumb question it is better to get clarity than to stew in the dark unenlightened when you get home from school do a quick recap on what you learned that day this will help you for when you need to revise it as it cements the day s learning and is much easier than cramming at the last minute and while it may not seem like it now learning as you go creates long term remembering whereas cramming trains only short term memory and prevents you from truly learning and having access to that information in the future do your homework this sounds like a no brainer but doing your homework effectively doesn t just mean sloppily writing something down and handing it in do your best on every assignment and as already stated ask questions when you don t understand something plan a homework schedule so that you don t get yourself into a time crunch build good relationships with your teachers this is especially important in high school because you may need to ask a few of your favorite teachers to write recommendations for your college applications the better they know you the better those recommendations will be but more than this these people can serve as mentors and guides as you move through high school and you can learn much from their knowledge and experience take your time to find the right friends the best friends are friends that you feel comfortable goofing off with and being serious with you shouldn t have to change your personality to please them good friends can be hard to find so remember that it s not uncommon to change your group of friends several times during your teenage years watch out for peer pressure many people experiment with a lot of things in high school and middle school and it is important to learn how to say no to anything you are not comfortable with listen to your instincts and do what s right sometimes people pretend to be friends just to get you to do something they re unwilling to do themselves such as steal things buy drugs or cheat none of these things are worth founding a relationship on and if you re caught it s you who gets into trouble and you ll find the so called friendship fails instantly build a relationship with your parents although it often seems as though they don t take you seriously letting your parents know that they can trust you will usually lead to you having more freedom recognize that this is a hard time for your parents remember that they re not out to make your life miserable while you feel like you should be treated like an adult your parents are struggling with the realization that you re not their baby anymore they are also likely to be struggling with working paying a mortgage raising your siblings as well as you and doing their best to be good parents it s not an easy job but you can make it easier by being understanding and friendly get to know your siblings your little sister might seem like the most annoying person in the world now but you re likely going to spend the rest of your life with her plus being at home will be much more fun when every night is like a sleepover with your best friend help out around the house some chores take less than five minutes to complete when many hands are applied to them and your parents and siblings will be in a much better mood if there is one less thing for them to do you can even morph chores into a fun way to spend time with your family by turning them into a contest try blasting music that everyone enjoys or having a nice conversation while you work and setting time limits for completion if you have winners for properly completed chores prizes can include things like choosing the dvd or movie to watch as a family or choosing what gets cooked for dinner for that evening when asked to do a task do it this can save many arguments around the house and when the chores are done you re free to do whatever you want arguing can take up a lot of time and creates emotional friction that nobody wants to feel schedule some me time life can get pretty busy as a teenager but it s important that you spend time with yourself as well figure out your hobbies and interests find something you love and make sure you do it regularly this will allow you to be refreshed and happy when it comes to other parts of your life don t be surprised if your interests change in the space of months or years that s natural while you re still working out what you enjoy most but don t try too hard just follow your interests to see where they lead and remain open minded about new possibilities too stay happy depression is a very common condition that tends to show up in your preteen or teenage years seek professional help if you think you may be depressed you may or may not get family support to help you through depending on your family circumstances but don t let a lack of such support stop you from caring for your mental health there is always someone who can help you sort out depressive or negative feelings and problems and the earlier you are treated the easier it will be to recover and gain both confidence and resilience for a happier future allow yourself to goof off from time to time always trying to be serious or focused can make you feel unhappy give yourself space to do fun things regularly to balance your studies activities and relationships listen to music this can help you relax and relieve some of the stress from a busy day at school or with friends music is a good way of expressing yourself too if you don t already know how to play an instrument consider learning one now such as the guitar piano or keyboard and don t forget that your voice is an instrument too learn ways to enjoy solitude learning to enjoy time spent alone is an important part of realizing that you re whole without another person this can help to prevent the development of co dependent relationships or to seek to make another person the source of your life s happiness solitude also helps you to learn more about what makes you tick as a person and what your life s values are some ways to find effective and enjoyable solitude include meditation walks by yourself writing in a journal and spending time with pets take care of yourself wash your face take regular showers eat home cooked meals instead of ready made ones etc always make sure to brush your teeth 2 3 times a day this will keep them clean and your breath smelling good exercise you don t have to go crazy but a little bit of physical activity each day such as biking to school will help keep both your body and mind healthy eat well eating too much or too little will make it hard to focus and cause you to do poorly in other areas get enough sleep having about 9 hours sleep is the best thing to be doing even on weekends it will prepare you for school and make yourself feel better the following morning try to schedule each week so that you get your homework done at a reasonable hour if you know you re going to have a lot on a given night talk to your teacher about getting an extension or even better handing it in early this will make your body more aware of what s going on and will make any dreadful bags under your eyes disappear wake up on time make sure you have enough time to have some breakfast wash your face have a shower if you need to etc before school starts packing your bag and hanging up your outfit uniform the night before will make everything a lot faster and more organized don t forget to lay out a clean pair of socks underwear and a pair of shoes also join boy scouts girl scouts 4 h or similar programs and stick with it these programs will give you a sense of community and teach you life skills they also open up a range of opportunities that might not be offered at school or through your social networks such as public speaking drama life or outdoor skills etc join a club school clubs are a great way get involved without sacrificing things you re passionate about they can also help you work out what sorts of hobbies and interests you enjoy most try a few over your teen years and don t be afraid to admit when one doesn t work for you and to keep looking try for a sports team this will teach you how to work in a team and you will become good friends with your team members alternatively if team sports don t do it for you at least find a sport that interests you be it athletics triathlons swimming tennis cycling or other more individual but still excellent sports even individual sports have team elements when you play on behalf of your school or region martial arts can be another excellent outlet for physical and mental development they are also a good way of developing self discipline while it s a good idea to begin in one martial sport it is possible to do more than one once you re proficient in your first martial art consider volunteering another extracurricular activity that benefits both you and others is volunteering choose something you re passionate about and set regular times to help out it might be something that fits in with a sport or activity you love too so it doesn t have to be about over stretching yourself while getting a job is a wonderful way to spend your extra time don t feel like it s necessary the things discussed above come first relationships studies and extracurricular activities a job is not worth sacrificing any of those aspects of your teen years and it is very hard to juggle a lot of different responsibilities with a job on the other hand if you feel you can manage to fit in a part time job with your other activities getting a job will help show your parents that you are responsible and can give you money to save or buy things that your parents can t spare the money for some common teenage jobs include babysitting if you have little siblings you can babysit them if not set signs over houses where anybody under 12 lives you can usually make pretty good money babysitting and this is a good weekend job that still lets you study or call friends on the phone

how to deal with an annoying situation,we always get stuck in situations when things are just too annoying in life from broken cell phones to people yelling at each other while you re waiting in line to buy lunch how do you deal with an annoying situation effectively without blowing your own gasket,practice immediate self restraint breathe deeply and if need be walk away and return later when you don t feel so ballistic about the situation try making fun out of situations that will most probably change your mood and then deal with it in a creative way tell yourself that the situation will pass good and bad things always come and go in life remind yourself that there are more important battles to be won and this isn t one of them put it into the big picture perspective of being a passing inconvenience not a total derailment of your day or life shift your concentration find an interesting part of a tree or shrub maybe even your hand and play with it you will find that while you are concentrating on that your anger will fizz away like bubbles in a glass of pop forgive yourself if you lost the plot if you ended up screaming cursing or stomping your foot the embarrassment is probably riling you let it go many people have bad moments including letting the annoyance show remind yourself that it s over now and that you won t repeat the performance again store the memory away to remind you of how it feels to you and looks to others when you do lose it so that you can recall it when needed again learn from what has happened this is only an immediate reaction to try to quell an annoying situation where you feel ready to explode to stay sane and not continue to find situations so annoying that you re apoplectic you ll need to take a longer term view about why you re finding any situation annoying so that you can deal with it in future the rest of this article tackles the longer term solving of coming across an annoying situation figure out what you mean by annoying before tackling any problem you need to be able to identify the real source of your frustration it s easy enough to huff that the situation is annoying but what is it really about other people s actions or behavior that bothers you so much assess what is bothering you for example are your co workers being noisy is your property being inappropriately used is something preventing you from getting somewhere on time are you being forced to wait for someone else s input before you can complete what you re doing whatever the reason pinpoint the frustration you re experiencing don t complain complaining to the person in question or to anyone who will listen that they are annoying won t fix anything try to be specific as you identify the problem to yourself it bothers me when dad treats me like i m five when i visit and won t let me watch the walking dead even though i m twenty five spend time reflecting over the issues that annoy you write them down and consider them in detail to try to find what you might be doing to make the situation worse or to see where you might be making something out of nothing consider other people s perspectives when dealing with any sort of interpersonal conflict it s important to try to sympathetically identify with the other person this means that you need to try to put yourself in their shoes and attempt to understand their perspective try to figure out why the other person is acting as they do you may eventually need to have a direct conversation with the person in which you air your grievances but you ll be better prepared for this if you first make some educated guesses on your own do you think that maybe the behavior has its source in the other person finding certain things too hard uncomfortable or unpleasant for themselves perhaps they are trying to avoid something by making their life a little easier without realizing the toll their actions takes on other people around them could it be that the annoying situation has arisen because the other person cares about or misses you and is trying to be helpful or get to see you more often learn more about the background to the situation you have your own unique take on the situation however you may not have a wider contextual understanding of it it is important to try to gather as much information as possible about the situation and those involved in it to gain a better understanding of what is motivating any problem behaviors comments attitudes or actions it is only when you really understand the wider picture and motivations that you can tackle the annoying aspects fruitfully once you do this you may be able to identify ways to begin to improve the situation and any future recurrences of it ask questions of others why do you see it this way why do you do it this way what outcome were you hoping for how would you rather we did this do you see my input as helping ask questions of yourself should i have been more patient could i have come at a different time do i treat people reasonably were my expectations reasonable am i trying to control the uncontrollable ask questions of the system is the system set up to handle this well is the system capable of fixing this is the system a part of the problem how can the system be tweaked to improve things what is different about the system this time from previous times assess what you could do differently next time it s rare for problems to be one sided so you do need to work out how you re contributing to the situation perhaps you re impatient with yourself and with others this is a fault and an attempt to gain a form of control over the often uncontrollable being patient is a way of self calming and showing self possession despite what is going on it s a sign of maturity perhaps you dislike the person or people involved in the situation this isn t an excuse to be annoyed it s a reason to rise above the dislike and to prove that you can handle what is happening in a responsible and neutral manner you don t have to like people in order to get along with them and make things work rely on being respectful and courteous instead of being emotional about it perhaps you re sending mixed messages to other people on the one hand you want your hot coffee with triple flavoring right now on the other hand you expect the blend to be perfect and not messed up good things in life come to those prepared to accept that good quality takes more than a snap of the fingers and you certainly can t demand that you have your cake and eat it too perhaps you re transferring your own traits that you don t like into the situation and feel irritated because you re seeing your own negativity reflected in this case you ll need to extricate your own issues from those of the situation perhaps it s nowhere near as bad as you think it s just your dour overlay from prior experience that is dampening things is your own track record at dealing with such situations spotty check your language the use of hostile arrogant snide sarcastic irritable or snappy language will make situations worse the more annoyed you are the more your body language displays this annoyance disarming others and potentially making things worse be calm and thoughtful accepting that remedying things requires kind words and a good level of patience knowing that you re someone who gets frustrated easily can cause others to produce the annoying situation out of fear or anxiety to try to do the right thing ball right in your selfish court on this one learn to remain calm and not respond immediately people with a cool mind tend to deal with problems in a much effective manner so develop tricks to cool it down practice counting to 10 and considering the words you use with care remember that it is often best to say nothing than to let out a string of invective that stirs up the situation and makes it worse try to see the positive side of the situation what have you learned about yourself and the situation will you know what to avoid or change next time are other people always going to behave this way and if so how can you react in a more constructive way that manages the behavior instead of responds to it with irritation you get the drift,Youth

how to be the girl everyone likes without changing who you are,being the girl who has friends in every clique and across the school or college without having to become like anyone in those cliques is a tough call but it s a challenge that an independent minded and spirited girl can achieve by keeping her mind focused on who she is what she wants in life and knowing where she s headed,be yourself this cliché is often stated but it s based in the reality that without knowing who you are stay yourself because if you re a follower people will take advantage of you nobody will ever be able to know the real you if you follow the actions of others this can lead to shaping yourself to fit in with them and it can also leave you open to being manipulated by selfish or uncaring sorts it takes time to grow into your own skin so don t fret about not knowing yourself yet indeed it s an ongoing process because a healthy person remains flexible and accepting of personal change being yourself is important for some of the following reasons it allows you to follow your own path and to be guided by good advice not swayed by people with bad intentions you can change on your own terms because as hard as it sounds you can forget who you are it means that you can handle criticism from other people it doesn t mean you don t have feelings rather you understand better that unless people have decent advice to offer their barbs are not worth taking on board you know what you want from life and won t be willing to change who you are just to fit in with someone else s plans or likes you are free to reach negotiated compromises that don t leave you any worse off in the spirit of sharing and getting along with others but you don t compromise who you are treat others with respect value the dignity of other people around you and accept differences being liked by many people is about showing a genuine interest in them for who they are and making it clear that you re not judgmental show interest openly by asking questions about things they care about or are interested and making an attempt to remember what they tell you when you see them again ask how whatever it is they like is going to show them you ve cared enough to remember and follow up avoid judging people by appearances give people a second chance if you feel instant discomfort around them maybe they need someone like you to reach out and let them be heard this will get you another friend find things you have in common with people in each group remember to stay sincere though if everyone only listens to rock but you only like it sometimes make sure you tell them that it s most likely that they will value you even more for freshness you bring to their clique be realistic not everyone will like you no matter who you are or how you come across there are many reasons for this but this reality is never a reason for you to put yourself down or feel unwanted you may never know why some people choose to dislike you and even if you do know it s just one of those things and not a reason to feel less worthy or to try to change to fit in with them leave them be it s their loss anyway sometimes they ll come around when they realize you really aren t affected by their put downs or choice to ignore you so stay strong aim to not care about their attitude but still respect their dignity as a person this includes staying polite and helpful and not spreading rumors or being mean towards them be sincere changing what you think or believe in for each clique will quickly earn you a bad reputation as people compare notes and realize you ve been pretending to like all sorts of things and it soon becomes clear you ve been stretching the truth somewhat when seeking to be liked do not seek to simply say what you think others want to hear or mistake being liked with being the exact same as the others you can show sincere interest but that doesn t mean you have to agree with or like the same things learn how to politely say that you find the other person s point of view approach or hobbies interesting but that they re not your personal way this is being sincere showing genuine interest in the person listening carefully but not leading them into thinking you have the same viewpoint or interest for example jenny tells alice that she loves going to movies every weekend alice personally thinks this is both expensive and a waste of time rather than saying yeah i love the movies every weekend too alice says that sounds like a really cool way to enjoy your weekend i am sure you know lots of movie trivia it d be great to have you on our quiz team for the movies section i only see movies about two to three times a year i just find i m so busy with other things in this way jenny s interest in movies is validated as a good thing to do alice has shown interest and made it clear that she s appreciative of the interest but doesn t do the same thing herself jenny might offer to tag along when alice does want to go to the movies some day but she won t expect alice to come to the movies every weekend now enjoy the company of others don t turn wanting to be liked into a chore or your

how to motivate kids,kids are curious creatures so you may think that they can motivate themselves sometimes though kids need a helping hand to stay motivated and focused on things that are important learning how to motivate your kids can help you keep them on track to a fulfilling and meaningful childhood,set clear goals with defined consequences a good way to motivate your child is to have goals that are well defined and to offer both rewards for when the goals are met and punishments if the goals aren t met it s best to avoid bribing your child but having rewards and punishments in place can help instill a sense of duty and obligation in your child 1 x research source be absolutely clear with what you want your child to accomplish use specific means of measurement like getting a b or higher on a test or finishing all of his her homework or chores by a certain time set clear consequences that will take effect if your child doesn t do what s expected of him or her for example you might take away tv and or internet privileges or suspend your child s allowance for the week enforce the rules with your children if they don t do what s expected of them they will need to learn that there will be consequences your child will come to realize that getting things done feels good while not doing them leads to feeling bad and your child will eventually learn to motivate himself or herself it s important to recognize when you re putting too much pressure or any unreasonable pressure on your child if you show any kind of disappointment when they fail for example you re probably pushing your children too hard and making them feel tremendous pressure if you offer rewards as an incentive make sure you re not offering physical prizes treats instead offer your child quality time together perhaps through a day spent together at the park or additional time at something he or she already has like extra tv time use positive reinforcement instead of bribery bribing kids may seem like a good idea and it will get some results however it only motivates kids to earn a treat or prize rather than instilling any kind of real work ethic or desire to help 2 x research source rewards only work for as long as the rewards keep coming or as long as a parent guardian is in the room to see the kid working using rewards like physical treats whether they re toys snacks or other prizes is not an effective long term strategy and it won t help your child develop his or her own self motivating skills positive reinforcement like earning time to play video games or go out with friends is more successful as a motivator than simple bribery 3 x research source if you want to offer healthy meaningful rewards try offering quality time spent with one or both parents as a way to motivate your child 4 x research source this type of positive reinforcement can help motivate your child while also avoiding a bribe based reward system teach value induction to get kids motivated value induction means explaining your values and imparting those values to your child by teaching your child that he or she should do something for specific reasons with long term repercussions it s much more likely that your child will end up being able to motivate himself or herself 5 x research source value induction has been proven to produce lasting effects in kids once a child has learned a value system that kid will be more likely to take up some or all of that value system and act out of real motivation values can be as simple as education is the most important thing without an education you won t be able to accomplish your dreams when you grow up you can help your kid develop his her own motivational value system by asking who or what that child wants to be when he she grows up you can then remind the child if you want to be like ______ you need to finish your homework ________ always put his homework and chores ahead of play time lead by example if you want your child to do something you re probably going to have to do it yourself as well this is true of work cleaning or finishing projects that have been started rather than leaving yourself open to accusations of it s not fair show your child that you do the same things he she does and find those activities rewarding 6 x research source many kids idolize adults if your child sees you doing chores and you tell him how satisfying it is to have a clean house he or she is more likely to help out if you re trying to lead by example with school work take an active interest in your kid s education you can also try taking a class at your local community college in something that interests you so that your kid will see you prioritizing education learn about your child s interests and help them develop every kid has something they find interesting weird or cool most of those interests can be tied to some area of study often science especially for kids who like playing outside and catching things as a parent the best way you can encourage those interests is by learning about what your child finds interesting at the moment and encouraging your child to fully explore that topic 7 x research source ask your child from time to time what he or she is most interested in try to get beyond cartoons or toys to find out what subjects and ideas he or she finds most intriguing explore your child s areas of interest together by visiting museums planetariums and or wilderness areas show interest and enthusiasm in the things your child gets excited about for example if your child is interested in stars learn as much as you can about stars and buy your child a telescope or astronomy books geared towards kids if your child is interested in art take trips to your local art galleries and buy your child drawing or painting supplies this can get your child excited about existing art while giving your child the tools to make his or her own art foster a learning environment at home learning extends beyond school your child brings home schoolwork and studies at home but it s important to encourage other areas of interest as well whether your child is interested in reading math history art or something else entirely make time and space at home for your child to explore those interests 8 x research source give your child as many books magazines and reading supplements as he or she can read spend time reading either together or separately in the same room if your child is still struggling with reading on his her own help out and read a book together help your child engage with different learning styles for example playing with blocks can help kids with sorting sequencing and problem solving especially kids who have a more tactile learning style be enthusiastic about the new things that you learn and show your child that it s good to be excited about learning new things make your expectations clear to your child every child has areas that they excel in and areas they struggle with this is normal but as a parent you ll need to help motivate your child to do really well in both areas 9 x research source talk to your child about how you expect him or her to do well in school expecting your kids to perform well can help them succeed while expecting them to perform poorly can lead a child to stop trying ask your child for honest input on what subjects he or she feels come easiest in school then ask about which subjects are the most difficult for your child focus your greatest expectations on the subjects your child does well in and give your child extra attention and study homework help on the subjects your child struggles with 10 x research source sit down with your child to reassess his or her strengths and weaknesses every two to three months and adjust your areas of expectation accordingly as your child s interests and strengths develop offer your support when your child struggles some children may feel like they can t ask a parent for help out of fear that it may come across as a sign of weakness avoid that pitfall altogether by taking an active role in your child s education and helping him her out with difficult assignments before your child has to ask for your help 11 x research source help your child with homework every night but be on the lookout for things that your child is struggling with more than others those subjects and activities will need the most guidance and instruction if your child isn t good at something help out and provide instruction guidance kids might say they find something boring or dumb when they don t know how to do that activity if your child says something along the lines of our homework assignment was dumb you may need to offer extra help and guidance praise your child s efforts even if he she doesn t succeed children need to know that they are loved no matter what happens some children may fear that doing poorly on a test will disappoint their parents while you ll need to convey to your child that a poor grade is bad and needs more work it s important to acknowledge your child s efforts regardless of the outcome 12 x research source praise can help keep kids motivated but if your child is struggling in school he or she may not be getting very good grades rather than discouraging your kid for trying and failing celebrate his or her efforts while also motivating your child to do better next time take more of an active role if your child is struggling in school offer support and help your child work through difficult assignments encourage hobbies of all kinds it s good for children to have things they re excited about no matter what your child wants to explore you should be supportive and encouraging as much as possible some kids will want to take up musical instruments while others may want to play sports some kids will want both and some won t want either find out what your child is interested in and encourage him her to explore that interest if your child shows an interest in something sign him or her up for lessons classes or in the case of sports try to enroll your child in a youth league for beginners you should also try to enjoy the things your child enjoys watch sports matches together listen to music together and go see live performances set daily or weekly goals with specific outcomes having specific goals makes it easier to motivate your child no matter what hobbies your child is interested in taking an active role should mean setting attainable goals for your child and pushing him her to achieve those goals 13 x research source goals with specific outcomes can be more challenging and therefore more engaging than just general goals like practice times for example instead of having your child practice a musical scale a certain number of times give your child a concrete and challenging goal like practicing until he she can play the first four or eight measures of a song without error motivate your child to get physically active your child doesn t necessarily need to get involved in sports although if he or she wants to you should encourage it kids do need plenty of exercise though as being physically active will help your child feel better have a more positive outlook and get a more restful night of sleep 14 x research source physical activity helps build strong muscles and bones while managing preventing weight gain these are results that your child can see and feel good about most kids will get active if they re given the right tools take your child to the park or a playground give him her equipment to play ball with and make it a fun activity that you can join in on if your kid wants you to 15 x research source encourage your child to get active with his her friends take them to the park to play ball together run obstacles through the playground etc teach your child to ride a bike using training wheels at first and gradually riding without them this is a great form of exercise and can allow your child to ride to from friends houses and the park as long as it s safe to ride a bike in your neighborhood always have your child wear a helmet whenever riding a bike and teach your child basic safety measures like wearing visible colors staying out of traffic and using hand signals to let others know when your child is stopping or turning remember that your child s interests will change most kids go through cycles of interest where something new and exciting takes the place of an older interest this is natural and it s normal no matter what hobbies your child pursues it s important to remember that the greatest thing in the world today may be old news in a few months and that s okay 16 x research source don t discourage your child from exploring new interests and don t force your child to keep participating in a hobby or sport he she doesn t enjoy any longer it may be frustrating especially if you spent a lot of money on instruments or equipment for this reason it may be best to rent equipment and instruments until your child knows it s something worth sticking with especially with equipment which your child will outgrow remember that forcing your child to keep doing something he she no longer enjoys will discourage your child from exploring interests and may make hobbies feel unfulfilling convey the importance of communal chores some children only do chores because it gets them an allowance while you may choose to give your child an allowance money alone shouldn t be the motivating factor explain to your child that you can t do everything by yourself and that your child s help would give him her some big grown up responsibilities 17 x research source chores can help your child have a sense of purpose at home chores can also let your kid feel like he or she is contributing to something bigger kids think of parents as running the household but many kids love to play house and chores let them actually help manage the home use chore charts or make your own chore charts are a great way to track what needs to be done each week and which tasks have already been accomplished you can find chore charts for free online to download and print or simply make your own at home 18 x research source chore charts can help your child see the tasks you expect to be completed on a list rather than just thinking about them in his or her mind as your child works through each task on the chore chart have your child check them off or mark them complete with a sticker checking off items on a list can bring a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment which is vital to your child s motivation in helping with chores make chores fun for kids chores may not be fun in and of themselves but you can make chore time a fun family time together try to make your child see chore time as quality time with room for play and conversation as long as the work gets done as well 19 x research source listening to music while you cook or clean together can turn chores into a fun dance party you and your child can pretend to be robots while you do certain chores or reenact scenes from your child s favorite movies using cleaning tools like a feather duster spray bottle or vacuum cleaner can be fun for kids because these tools are so foreign yet familiar largely from cartoons and movies 20 x research source keep chores manageable as you assign chores to your child it s important to remember that a chore being finished by your child may not look the same as it would when finished by an adult that s okay and over time through several years your child will get better and more skilled at cleaning cooking and other household tasks for the time being though make sure your expectations are reasonable and the workload is manageable for your child 21 x research source don t expect a perfect sparkling home your children are still kids not professional cleaners and there are limits to what they re capable of break chore time into smaller more manageable chunks instead of having a consecutive hour of cleaning for example you might set a timer for 15 minutes of cleaning and take little breaks together between each chunk of time change up the chores from time to time veering away from a predictable routine will help keep chores interesting and hopefully fun for your child if you have multiple kids you can alternate their chores if you just have one kid you can make him her a new chore chart every two weeks or every month that way your child will get used to changing assignments and get exposed to a wider range of tasks 22 x research source switching out tasks between multiple kids or between one kid and one parent can keep things interesting if your child has to do the same chores every week it might get repetitive and stop being fun one way to switch out chores if you have more than one child would be to have each kid clean their sibling s room instead of their own this may make older kids uncomfortable especially if they value privacy but for younger kids it can help change things up don t be afraid to give kids some more difficult tasks many kids find these tasks fun while easier chores are sometimes seen as being boring 23 x research source praise completed chores and celebrate the effort don t take your child s work for granted it takes a lot more work for your child to finish all of the chores you assigned than it would take for you and if you want your child to stay motivated you ll need to give him her praise and some sense of accomplishment 24 x research source praise your kids when they finish their chores and thank them for their work let your child feel like part of the household by saying something like thank you for all your hard work we re a good team and i couldn t have done it without your help 25 x research source do something fun with your kids when they finish all their chores you might try taking them out to see a movie or going out for ice cream sundaes if your child hasn t finished the chores he or she was given wait until those chores are completed don t let your child go to his her room or play until the chore is complete and withhold celebrations that week since your child didn t stay motivated,Youth

paper hang them up in their bedroom as a reminder make the rules as simple and positive as possible for example ask nicely before borrowing a toy and treat other people s possessions with respect and

rule like with rules you and your children can also create and agree on the appropriate consequences for each rule 9 x research source for example if a child plays with a toy longer than the scheduled time the amount of time they went over will be subtracted from the next round of playing additionally if the children begin to fight over a toy make the toy off limits until they can figure out a way

you should monitor the conflict to see if they can work it out on their own if they try to involve you remind them that because they are responsible for creating the conflict they are also responsible for resolving the conflict praise and reward your children if they resolve the conflict on their own if you see that one of your children is afraid of or avoiding the other sibling and always the victim then you may need to intervene to prevent the conflict from becoming emotionally violent try to encourage win win situations where each child gains something if your children are young for example toddlers then you will probably need to intervene to help resolve the conflict intervene if a conflict becomes violent you must stop the fight immediately and separate the children once your children have calmed down bring them back together to talk about what happened let them know that violence is not a valid solution and will not be tolerated under any circumstances 11 x trustworthy

how to become a trustworthy person,being trustworthy is admirable and desirable it s a trait other people look for in a person and it s confirmation that you re reliable supportive and honest if you d like to become more trustworthy and have others come to rely on you there are some great ways to go about doing this,be of good character have more than good intentions in life while it s nice to mean well it s far better to show people that you re a person who is reliable tries their best at all times and thinks clearly meaning well can end in all sorts of problems including excusing oneself for failure to follow through on the other hand good character lets other people know that you have traits they can always rely upon actions prove far more than words good character is forged in good caring and thoughtful actions be reliable and keep your word when you say that you will do something for someone then do it people rely on a promise and seeing it through is the hallmark of a

in everything you do honesty is the keystone to people knowing where they stand with you honesty includes having good manners though when being frank at least be polite sometimes it is necessary to sugarcoat the truth so that its bitter pill is swallowed with greater ease some honesty can be hard but is still essential for example your least favorite coworker has spinach stuck in his teeth after a work function do you tell him of course you do he deserves to know that your arch enemy has her skirt tucked into her knickers after visiting the bathroom do you tell her of course you do she deserves to know that you may have qualms because you initially think it s funny payback or just desserts but realize that by being honest here you gain respect from people who would otherwise be thorns in your side they owe you one and know you are someone solid even in hard situations always tell the truth be compassionate kind and considerate these traits feed into trustworthiness because they let people know that you give people the time of day and that you re willing to give second chances compassion must be felt from within and learned through experience by standing in other people

like you support each other and help each other to continue growing as good human beings throughout life quality over quantity applies to friendships as much as anything else in life while being friendly to all is a great trait having quality friends who are close to you will often mean the group is much smaller don t deceive people don t lie there will be times when deception and lying seem

the reality to others when they lack the facts but mouth off anyway 5 x research source move away from the gossip clan gossiping clans make sure you take turns to dish out garbage about those not in

of the old ways that involved hurting people maintain the long term relationship in place of the short term gain cheating on lying to or sneaking around someone you care about because you re focused

poor attitude and bad ways of reacting to others earning trust takes time too especially if you have been a difficult human being in the past yet it will happen especially as you continue to prove through your actions that you are reliable honest and of good character remind yourself at all times that being trustworthy is a valuable asset to your life and to the lives of the people you care

up to and including joining or avoiding groups feeling alienated or inclusive bored having fun physical changes you may experience an intense desire to fit in with some group to be accepted by your peers of similar age level and interests even self proclaimed weirdos who celebrate their individuality have like minded friends it s normal to feel like you re not normal enough we all want to fit in somewhere and fitting in doesn t mean you have to become a mindless drone with a relentless drive to conform embrace your inner weirdness and become the truest version of yourself that s normal,spend time with people who are doing positive activities that you want to do it s getting increasingly easy to spend too much time alone while some solitude can be good even loners have to come out to work play or eat sometimes to act normally and behave in a well adjusted manner not too different it s important to spend time around other people socializing and learning from them so you can interact more directly and easily get involved just being around a variety of people in a coffee shop or at a restaurant or at the movies can help you learn about others and feel less isolated this will make you more comfortable in your own skin which in turn will make you more experienced at opening up and interacting find places where you re likely to run into like minded people love comics quit buying them online and hit up your local comic shop love to make art head to an art class craft store or the museum take a class in one of your interests and talk some with others learning the same topic or skill get in a choir or take music lessons some churches have music school and sport activities online friends exist in a gray area they re real a lot of the time but our interactions online are much different than our up close mano a mano interactions try to balance your time socializing online with at least as much if not more face to face interactions be happier by not hanging around people who act out in negative too wild or crazy ways having a pessimistic excitable or silly friend is fine but if being around them makes you uncomfortable consider whether you should keep them as a friend they may get themselves and you into unwanted difficulties and disgrace so to speak avoid getting closer or hooked up with hateful troubled mean destructive or violent persons if you re good at something offer up your help to those who may need it when asked for give your opinion or assistance don t go looking for trouble let it come to you and try to stay out of it pay attention to the body language of others when you re around people keep an eye out for any clues they might give regarding how to behave normally in situations mirror the behavior of others if it makes you comfortable when you re in the library and everyone looks very studious quiet and absorbed in their work it s probably not the best time to start cutting up and trying to make jokes if everyone s dancing at a school dance it might be normal to dance but you don t have to it s normal to feel both ways if your neighbor at the lunch table keeps trying to make eye contact and smiles continuously at you it s probably a good time for a conversation if you feel open try being friendly available communicating people often have open posture shoulders back head up not too relaxed relaxing but not acting open may be about instead acting tired sleepy angry shy or grumpy arms and legs crossed may be a sign that they are satisfied to sit alone not looking to be friendly learn to recognize and not act that way in your own interactions if people are uncommunicative or closed off to you head down arms crossed they probably don t want to talk if you press the issue it s possible that you might make them feel uncomfortable learn to recognize this and disengage from the conversation or interaction give them some space be a good listener and wait for your turn to speak when you re talking with someone or with a group of people try to balance listening and talking in equal measure you don t have to be the one to contribute the most if you want to be noticed it s just as important to be an active listener look at the person who s talking nod your head to show that you re listening and really listen to what is being said 1 x research source stay on topic if everyone in a group is going around telling stories about their weekend tell a story about your weekend if you have one it would be kind of strange to break the spirit of the moment i had to watch my dad eat pickled herring he eats weird stuff all the time hopefully that s not really about your weekend don t hijack a conversation and take it elsewhere or else expect groans and protests at your sense of humor breaking the line of thought unless it s time to change the topic listening doesn t mean looking across the room or thinking of what you re going to say until a moment of silence appears in a conversation for you to fill however listening means actively receiving and responding to what the other is saying nicely not just trying to think of what you re going to say next to top that bit accept the others points as worthwhile even if you ve heard it already then without a yawn or cut down say hey yeah excellent point that s true but have you ever been to done this ___ 2 x research source draw your personal boundaries a teenager is an individual who wants to be seen as mature and experienced as one s peers due to this while you strive to become the best you it can often be tempting to get pushed or pulled into things you might not be ready for or even interested in smoking drinking experimenting with the thrills of asking for dates actually going on dates when parents permit holding hands hugging kissing and deciding your approach to love expressing your new found state of being a teen balancing all these aspects is what normal teenagers confront in their everyday lives while there s not just one set way to approach each of these aspects what you should know is that it s your decision to stand for your values beliefs and to accept your responsibility to understand the consequences of conduct and behavior in close relationships it s your life make your choices the right ones to draw your best boundaries close to your heart the closer you set your daily life boundaries to your present norms and accepted truths where you re coming from the sooner you can be well adjusted in your way you ll be able to avoid other way out freaky or boring stuff and be able to expand and extend your near boundaries launching out near your everyday unusual stuff keep it real keep it simple is easier than going off track or out into the far off unknown wanting to fit in is normal and it s true that engaging in risky behaviors seems like a way to fit in and get people to respect you but why would you compromise your personality and beliefs if you re not being yourself it s not you they re respecting or even noticing keep it cool another good boundary to keep in mind is secrecy it s okay to keep some things to yourself it s almost too easy to put every event success and failure every frustration anger and joy up on facebook as a status update does it all really need to be there for everyone to see and dis you you give the answer make your room an awesome sanctuary for a teenager there s nothing more critical than having a space all to your own make your room as unique as you are filled with posters or candles records or drawings fill it with yourself paint it whatever color you want and fill it with things you like to look at take some time thinking about what would make the ideal room and get permission to make it that way if you don t have your own room find somewhere you feel comfortable that you can spend time in take a walk out into the yard or the woods find a great sitting park bench or find a table by a window that you love at the library or spend time in a friend s basement den try to find somewhere quiet and available to you where you can find peace wear clean clothes that fit you properly there s no normal type of clothes to wear styles change all the time and it can be very difficult to keep up wear whatever is comfortable and affordable for you but make sure the clothes are as flattering as possible skinny jeans and crop tops may be in but just because they re popular or normal doesn t mean they re necessarily right for your body type wear clothes that will flatter your figure and feel comfortable not something that will leave you feeling unconfident or exposed don t be a wannabe don t be afraid to have your own style if you think throwback basketball jerseys and athletic shorts are cool you re in good company if you think rugby shirts and khaki pants look good you re in safe waters the important normal constant is that whatever you wear is clean and form fitting 3 x research source learn some about contemporary fashion it s a good idea to pay attention to what other kids are wearing not because you must conform and wear the same thing but so you can at least have some concept of the average dress wear then if you choose to go in another direction you ll be aware of what you re doing and not end up wearing plaid grandpa pants and golfing shoes to school because you think it s normal you don t have to go to expensive stores to dress normally box stores like target walmart and other outlets usually have sale items that are affordable and current at thrift stores try to find the newest cleanest clothes available that are in your size in middle school especially it can seem that all anyone cares about is getting the next must have clothes trend which are usually expensive and will be forgotten in another six months

parents about when it s appropriate to start wearing make up if you want to use a small amount of natural coloring to highlight your beauty if you choose to style your hair and keep it clean your hair is just as important as any other part of your body it takes some work to keep it healthy and clean your hair should be washed at least every 2 3 days to keep it strong and lustrous both boys and girls should comb their hair regularly to keep it untangled and healthy if you use products don t go overboard a little mousse gel or hairspray can go a long way you don t want a crispy frosted flat top like it s 1996 aim for a natural look that highlights your normal hair experiment with new haircuts going for a buzz or growing it out like a rocker if you want being a teenager is the one time you can experiment with your personality and your identity take care of your body when you re young it seems like you re invincible you can eat like there s no tomorrow stay out all night and go through your day like it s nothing and recover from injuries super fast unfortunately it won t last it s important to build the good habits that will ensure your health throughout your teenage years and further on too pay attention to what and how much you re eating most teenagers have crazy high metabolisms due to growth spurts meaning that you ll be able to eat lots and lots of high calorie food without gaining extra weight especially if you re physically active and play sports when that high metabolism ends though or you stop playing sports it s possible to suddenly gain lots of weight it s important to develop a love of physical activity early on so you can build the good habits that will keep you healthy in the long run 5 x research source you don t have to be one of the jocks to enjoy exercise if you love basketball but don t want to play on the team go to the park and shoot hoops who cares if you miss more than you make if you don t love playing any competitive sports try out hiking around the woods and getting into nature or see if you don t enjoy rock climbing or other solo adventures find hobbies that help you relax as a teen you should have hobbies and interests to keep you occupied and engaged school probably won t cut it try to find extracurricular hobbies that will let you blow off some steam and find enjoyment some kind of extracurricular activity can be a great way of meeting other kids your age and socializing without having to meet people yourself many teenagers take sports very seriously find out what team sports are offered at your school and consider trying out for the team if you don t like any of the sports offered tennis lessons golf lessons or other individualized sports might be more appropriate for you heck check out learning how to fence check out clubs at school sports aren t even close to being the only way to socialize at school foreign language clubs chess clubs art clubs ecology clubs and all sorts of organizations are available to students for fun and learning outside of school if you don t like any of the clubs at your school check out after school programs at the ymca or other youth center in your town or check out a youth group at a church 6 x research source try playing music whether in marching band concert band or by starting your own garage band music can be a great outlet for teenagers studies show that teens who study music learn more efficiently and have a great amount of fun and camaraderie playing broaden your worldview as you get older it s important to learn as much as you can about other people and learn to exercise your empathy skills a child thinks only of themselves and an adult is able to think more selflessly but a teenager is somewhere in the middle it can be tough mission trips and exchange programs can be excellent and effective experiences for many teenagers if such opportunities are available likewise getting a part time job and learning to work for your keep is an important growing up step that you can learn in the summer time or on the weekends after school read as much as you can about as much diverse topics that you can travel from the comfort of a chair by checking out novels travelogues sci fi fantasy whatever you like reading read some things that are challenging and some things that are easy read all the time read everything try out different ways to express yourself being a teen is a time of experimenting trying on new identities until you learn which one fits you the best in a given year you might switch back and forth between thinking you want to be a doctor and loving your position on the soccer team to wanting nothing but to write poetry and hang out with painters and paint your fingernails black that s ok that s normal try out being an art kid take some art classes and learn the fundamentals to see you if you d like to spend your days in the studio creating strange masterpieces try out the exciting world of mystery lots of teenagers take solace in the dark clothes and powerful vibes of a mysterious person while it might seem weird it s pretty normal embrace your inner athlete jocks don t have to be the villains from high school drama movies be a well adjusted athlete who takes sporting seriously make it your thing find like minded people find a community of people you like and people who are like you and get to know them well hang out in school and outside of school support each other and lift each other up emphasize forging a few strong relationships over lots of meaningless ones it s not worth having 800 facebook friends if you can t talk to any of them in real life alternatively it s also a good idea to meet lots of people who you don t necessarily have a lot in common with if you re a sporty athlete hang out with some of the art kids every now and then to see what you have in common try to make all sorts of different friends make room in your life for school and work having fun is important but taking your responsibilities seriously is just as important a part of growing up save enough time in your busy teenage schedule to complete your schoolwork and work as hard as possible at doing well even if you think you re sure what you want to do in life and that plan doesn t involve algebra trigonometry give it your best shot you never know how you might regret blowing off that welding class or zoning out during sewing down the road make sure you take excellent notes notes force you to pay attention improve your memory and provide you with a helpful study guide do your homework don t slack off on it because believe it or not it really does help you learn pay attention in class and ask questions to stay engaged respect your teachers and try to make the best of it give some thought to the future where do you want to be in ten years in twenty what do you want to do with your life tough questions for anybody and uncomfortable questions for most especially teenagers but it s something you re going to have to struggle with the more you struggle with it the better you ll prepare yourself for your teenage years and the more normal you ll be it s something everyone struggles with before transitioning into adulthood if you want to go to college start researching affordable places you might attend that seem to be full of people like you or places that offer the kinds of specialties you d like to study many teens who struggle to make friends or fit in during high school really come into stride during college it s also normal and perfectly fine to have no idea what you want to do with your life don t worry about it too much that s perfectly normal when people ask tell them that you re just trying to get through your teens first,Youth

how to convince your parents to let you switch schools,school is an important part of your life 1 x research source you want to make sure that you re somewhere you feel comfortable and enjoy it might take time to convince your parents that you need to switch schools but if you have good reasons and a good argument you can successfully help them to understand why you want to change schools,write down your primary reason for wanting to change schools 2 x research source before you can make a good argument with your parents you need to understand why you really want to change schools you need to be able to state this reason clearly some reasons you might want to change schools include you ve been dealing with bullying and you don t think it s going to get better or you don t feel comfortable staying around those people before asking your parents make sure your certain you d like to switch writing pros and cons may help if you know this school will cost money show them how much you want to go to this school despite the cost you feel lost in the crowd of a large school with large classes and you d like a smaller environment you don t think your school is helping you academically you might need a more challenging school or a school where you could help more individualized help there s another school that has programs you re really interested in like a superior drama music art band or sports program the social environment is not what you want maybe you don t have a lot of friends or have different views than your peers when presenting this reason word it carefully so it doesn t give your parents the idea that you just want to party don t say it like the only thing in school is about having friends either tell them you need a study buddy and no one at your current school is willing to help you out as you are writing down this reason make sure it is important enough to switch for example if you just don t like math and your school gives you a lot of homework that s not a good reason to switch or if your boyfriend or best friend goes to a different school this is not necessarily a good enough reason to switch outline timeliness for changing schools this will affect how you approach your parents about your situations if you give your parents exact dates that you want to change schools it will make it easier for them to say yes and not put off letting you switch if you re being bullied you might want to make a mid year switch however if you want to change to a school that will push you more academically then you could consider switching for the next academic year as this will be easier to arrange make a calendar on a piece of paper or print out a calendar and write the date you want to switch schools then write down a date to have a conversation with your parents about changing you want to give them as much advance notice as possible at least a few months look at schools you d like to attend 3 x research source before you talk to your parents about switching schools you want to look at alternative schools you might like to attend that way you can tell your parents why you d like to go to a different school look at schools based on your reason for switching for example if you want to change schools because you don t feel challenged academically look at schools that have a lot of honors programs write down your positive reasons for changing schools it can be tempting to only talk about all the bad things about your experience at your current school while it s important to tell your parents what s going on to make you want to switch you also want to show them the benefits of changing write a list of all the good things you find out about other schools if you have friends or even friends on facebook that go to schools you d like to consider ask them to tell you what they like about the school so you can pass it along to your parents write it out and practice you should approach this conversation almost like you are preparing to give an important speech 4 x research source you want to write out how you want the conversation to go visualize it going well practice saying all your reasons out loud to yourself in the mirror or to a friend come up with an introduction you want to get your parent s full attention as you convince them to help you in switching schools say something like hey mom and dad can we all sit down at the table together i have something i d like to talk about with you and i d really love to hear what you think you want to let your parents know that this is important to you and that you appreciate them listening to your thoughts keep your words calm and mature even if your parents don t respond at first you don t want to come across as whiney because this will make it less likely that your parents will support you in switching schools at the same time be honest 5 x research source you want them to know how much staying in your current situation will hurt you make your statements sincere and to the point if you re being bullied don t be too embarrassed to show them how much it s affecting your performance at school and how much it hurts you say something like there is a group of kids in my class that writes mean notes to me every day and steal things out of my desk they call me names and it makes me sad i ve asked them to stop and i ve talked to the teacher but they still do it behind her back i have a hard time enjoying school or focusing because i can t stop thinking about it if you think you need a school with more academic attention say something like i ve been having a hard time finishing my work in school because i don t understand it there are so many kids in my class that the teacher usually doesn t have time to help me or if you want more of a challenge say i get all a s at school because the work is too easy i finish all my work first and i end up just sitting there in class my teacher doesn t have time to make special assignments for me write out your positives these are the reasons that changing would improve your overall life some examples of positive reasons to practice might be i m really interested in learning to play music jackson middle school has the best band program in the state and it s only ten minutes away i d really get to work on my skills there st john s school only has 10 students in each class if i went there i d be able to get more help with my work and my grades would get better central middle school has a lot of science and math classes i could take they even have a physics class i want to be an engineer one day and it s never too early to start learning make your conclusion open ended you don t want your parents to have to decide right then whether you can change that pressure will make them more likely to say no out of convenience end the conversation with a statement like thanks for listening to me take some time to think about what i said and let me know what you think i really hope you ll think about letting me change schools bring up the subject gradually when you sit down to talk to your parents about schools you don t want them to be completely surprised by the fact that you want to change if you have an emergency like severe bullying you should talk to your parents immediately otherwise let them get a sense of your situation before you ask them to talk with you make it clear to them that you re unhappy in your school every day tell them one little thing that bothered you at school when they ask about your day for example let them know we got our math tests back today and i didn t do so well i went to ask my teacher a few questions about what i got wrong but she didn t have time to talk to me do nice things for your parents before you try to talk to them 6 x research source this is a classic part of persuasion in any situation be especially kind to your parents in the few weeks before you want to actually ask them to switch schools don t argue with them or talk back to them do the little things they ask the first time like cleaning your room and picking up after yourself pick a good time to talk you don t want to sit down and talk to your parents about switching schools while they are stressed or in a hurry find them when they are relaxing and ask them if they have a minute to talk to you for example a good time to talk might be after dinner once everyone is full and the house is clean write them a letter sometimes it can be difficult to talk to your parents about certain situations this especially helps if you re not sure how to let your parents know you re being bulled after you give them the letter they ll come to approach the conversation with you this can take some of the pressure off of starting a serious conversation especially if you re being bullied you can use a letter to let your parents know exactly what your bullies are doing to you so you don t have to say it out loud but your parents will still know how serious your situation is,Youth

will need to find some new ways to get organized develop strategies for getting the most out of class time and incorporate some good habits for passing your english tests if you are willing to put in a little extra time and effort then you can pass your english class,ask questions before you begin asking yourself some pre reading questions can make it easier for you to retain what you read before you start reading a text determine what you need to discover from the text some instructors will provide students with a list of questions to help them stay focused as they read you might ask your instructor about good questions to keep in mind as you read you can also develop your own questions for example you might simply ask what is the focus of this chapter take your time give yourself plenty of time to read and take breaks as needed it is better to go slowly when you read a text than to rush through it and have to re read it later on 1 x research source make sure that you provide yourself with plenty of time to read and understand what you read for example if you have to read 40 pages of a book by friday start reading on monday and just read 10 pages per night don t put off reading until thursday night write in the margins making notes in the margins whenever you encounter something important is more effective than highlighting or underlining the passage try reading with a pen in your hands instead of holding a highlighter you can write key words in the margins ask questions or comment on something that just happened summarize what you have read writing summaries of what you just read can help you to commit the information to memory as well after you finish reading a chapter of a book or a short story take a minute to write a brief summary of what you just read in your summary don t worry about including every little detail instead try to provide a nice overview of the action you also might want to include a paragraph where you discuss your ideas about the reading for example if something surprising happened in the chapter you might talk about how you reacted to it and why summaries are also a good place to record information about symbols themes and characters for example you might note that the author uses nature symbolism to describe certain characters use online study guides after reading there are many online guides that you can utilise in order to better comprehend the literature that you re assigned to read websites like sparknotes and cliffsnotes provide summaries character analyses interpretations helpful hints essay tips and more for many different books read these after completing your reading assignment to feel more confident in understanding the material 2 x research source don t rely solely on reading sparknotes or cliffsnotes reading only these guides will usually not give you enough information to be successful tell someone about the reading teaching someone else about the text that you have been reading is a great way to commit the information to memory as well try telling a classmate or friend about the chapter you just read when you tell someone about the reading try to summarize the main ideas and explain anything that might be difficult to understand if you have not read the book make sure that you explain the reading in your own words don t just repeat parts of what you read word for word take time to prewrite prewriting also known as invention is what you do to generate ideas before you actually write a paper while it may be tempting to skip prewriting and just start drafting your essay for english class it is worth taking the time to prewrite by spending time developing your ideas before you write you can improve the quality of your work freewriting this is when you write as much as you can without stopping even if your mind is blank you should write my mind is blank until you get an idea to write about after you finish writing read over your freewrite and identify any important ideas that might be useful for your paper listing this is when you create a list of all of everything you can think of that is relevant to the essay topic when you have listed as much as you can read over your list and identify any useful information clustering this is when you use lines and circles to connect your ideas on a piece of paper for example you can begin by writing your topic at the center of the page and then draw lines coming from this idea keep drawing more lines and making connections until you are out of ideas 3 x research source research your topic some english papers will require you to conduct research before you write if you have to write a research paper then make sure that you spend some time finding quality sources and reading them carefully search your library s databases rather than just doing a basic internet search you will be more likely to find quality sources by using your library s database check with a librarian if you are not sure how to use your library s databases create an outline an outline provides the basic structure for an essay outlines can be as detailed as you want and this can be a great way to keep yourself focused when you start drafting your paper 4 x research source outlining your essay before you get started can help you write a better paper as well draft your essay drafting is when you take your notes outline and all of the ideas in your head and put them onto paper in essay form if you have done adequate freewriting research and outlining then this step should not be too difficult keep in mind that if you struggle with the drafting phase of the writing process then you can always return to one of the previous phases and come back to the drafting phase when you feel ready remember to use your outline to guide you as you write revise your work revising is when you go over a piece of writing before you submit it to determine if you need to add delete reorganize or clarify something revising your work can help you to develop your ideas and catch minor mistakes as well make sure that you allow yourself plenty of time to read over your work and revise it as needed you can always swap papers with a friend and provide feedback for each other just make sure that the friend is someone who you trust to provide good feedback you might also consider asking your instructor or a writing center tutor to look over your paper for you and give you revision suggestions having a few days to revise is ideal but if you can only spare a few hours then that is fine as well all essays benefit from revision so do not consider this as an optional step try to give yourself a break before you revise even taking a few hours away from the paper will allow you to return to it with fresh eyes ask to re write unsuccessful essays if you tried your best but didn t do as well as you wanted on an essay assignment ask to meet with your instructor about how the essay can be improved after getting extensive feedback ask your instructor if you can rewrite your essay and apply their revision suggestions for partial or extra credit this may be an opportunity to improve your grade and your writing abilities and the worst they can say is no make flashcards if you need to master certain vocabulary words for a test then making flashcards is a great way to commit these words to memory to make flashcard write the word on one side of an index card and then write the definition of the word on the other side you might also find it helpful to provide yourself with an example of how to use the word in a sentence keep the flashcards with you and study them whenever you have a few spare minutes for example you can study your flashcards while waiting in line or riding the bus 5 x research source read for fun reading is an excellent way to improve your vocabulary and grammar skills 6 x research source try to discover a book or series of books that you enjoy and read during your spare time read as much as possible and choose books that are slightly challenging for you look up words that you do not understand when you are reading make sure to make a note of the word s definition as well use new words in conversation and in writing using new words will help you to remember them and figure out how to use them try to use the new words that you learn as often as you can for example you might try out a new word in a conversation with a friend or include a few of the new words that you have learned in an english essay keeping a journal where you try out new words is another great option consider getting a tutor if you struggle with english sometimes then getting a tutor from the writing center at your school may help you to develop your skills a tutor can work with you on any areas that give you trouble such as grammar vocabulary or reading most schools provide tutor services to students as a free benefit your fees and tuition help to cover the costs of providing these services learn what is expected of you when the semester begins read over the course materials and make sure that you understand everything that is expected of you if you do not understand something then ask the instructor to explain it to you highlight important details in your assignment sheets and other course materials for example you might want to highlight key words for assignments such as describe argue compare etc 7 x research source copy down all of the important due dates for your english class in your planner or on a wall calendar to make it easier for you to remember them plan ahead figure out how much time you will need to complete your assignments read books and essays and study for tests make sure that you set aside plenty of time to complete these objectives every week procrastinating is a sure way to fail your english class if possible start your assignments at least a week before they are due having plenty of time is especially important for writing essays starting early will provide you with more time to develop and revise your work 8 x research source keep in mind that in college level english courses the majority of your grade will come from assignments that are later in the semester for this reason make sure that you do not burn yourself out early in the semester take good care of yourself and reserve plenty of energy to finish the semester 9 x research source find a study partner or group studying with a classmate or a couple of classmates can improve your grades and make it easier for you to pass your english class plan to meet at least once per week to study and quiz each other try to team up with classmates who are good students studying with someone who is a good student will make it easier for you to excel in english class than studying with someone who is struggling 10 x research source if you plan to study with a friend or group of friends it can be easy to get distracted talking about other things to prevent this from happening try studying at the library the quiet environment should make it easier for you and your study group to stay focused 11 x research source come to class attendance is essential for passing any class but it may be even more important in an english class where participation may make up a large part of your grade make sure that you are present in body and mind whenever you attend your english class never sleep in class silence your cell phone and always keep it stowed away during class avoid chatting with your classmates especially when your instructor is talking take notes in class much of what your english instructor talks about during lectures will end up on your tests and exams for the course this information can also be helpful when you are writing papers make sure that you take good notes during class to earn as many points as possible on your english class assignments 12 x research source write as much as you can during class to help you retain the information things that your instructor writes on the board or includes on a powerpoint may be even more important to remember so be sure to write these things down if you have trouble keeping up then you may consider recording lectures with your instructor s permission or asking a friend to compare notes with you after class speak up if your instructor ever says something that does not make sense or that you d like to know more about make sure that you speak up raise your hand and ask your instructor to repeat explain or expand on what he or she just said keep in mind that most instructors are happy to elaborate on a point if it will help you to understand it just make sure that you are listening closely because an instructor may find it annoying if you are always asking him or her to repeat things that have already been explained meet with your instructor outside of class your instructor probably has regular office hours where you can drop in or make an appointment to meet with him or her one on one make sure that you take advantage of this valuable resource 13 x research source meeting with your instructor outside of class is a great way to get some extra help with assignments ask questions that you didn t want to ask in class or just get more information about something try to meet with your english instructor at least once per semester go above and beyond if you really want to excel in your english class then look for ways to go above and beyond your instructor s expectations if your instructor ever says that something is a good idea but that it is optional do it anyways these extra assignments can help you to increase your knowledge and that may improve your grade some instructors even offer extra credit for completing optional assignments 14 x research source for example if you are assigned a short story and your instructor says it might be a good idea to get a little background on the story s reception after you read it then do it if your instructor recommends flashcards as a good option for improving your vocabulary then make some flashcards study in short sessions rather than staying up all night for one big cram session the night before a test try studying in small sessions over the course of a week studying in smaller sessions will make it easier for you to retain the information that you take in and it will be less stressful for you as well 15 x research source for example if you have a test on friday and you expect that you will need to study for about six hours to get a passing grade on the test then break your study sessions into three two hours sessions over the course of the week make sure that you take a short break every 45 minutes as well most people can t concentrate for more than 45 minutes at a time so taking a short break about 5 to 10 mins will help you to reset and stay focused 16 x research source attend any review sessions that are offered some instructors offer review sessions before an exam to go over the material that will be on the test make sure that you attend these sessions whenever they are offered it can be tempting to skip review classes since it is a review of old material but you will increase your chances of passing english if you attend take a practice test before you take the actual test taking a practice test may be beneficial try asking your instructor for some practice test questions to help you prepare or come up with some practice questions of your own you can create a practice test based on your knowledge of what will be on the test 17 x research source when you take the practice test make sure that you simulate an actual test environment put away your notes books etc and time yourself check your answers when you are done and use your results to help you figure out what you need to spend more time studying get a good night s sleep before the test being well rested is one of the best ways to ensure that you will be able to focus on a test make sure that you go to bed a bit earlier than usual the night before your english test for example if your usual bedtime is 11pm try going to bed at 10pm instead,Youth

to her at home if she is your significant other or you could make plans to meet her for lunch for example avoid letting on that you want to talk to her about her secretive behavior if you are making plans in advance this will likely cause her to decline your invitation and make it harder for you to talk to her to find out what is going on bring up the topic calmly and rationally there is the possibility that she could become explosive when you bring up the topic so do your best to diffuse the situation by remaining calm however this does not mean that you should be evasive or vague about what you are getting at you need to be clear and straightforward about her secrecy so that she fully understands the conversation i get the feeling lately that you re keeping something from me my relationship with you is important to me so i d like to talk about it you ve had some interesting reactions to comments i ve made lately i don t want to offend you but it seems like you might be

book until you fell asleep but stacy said that the two of you went out dancing i m hurt that you lied to me and i m wondering why you felt the need to do that listen attentively to her response remember to stay calm and give her the opportunity to respond to you without interrupting if she continues to appear secretive let her know that you are observing particular behaviors that indicate she might be lying like an inability to maintain eye contact making frequent pauses in her response or giving too many details then ask her again to be honest with you if she continues to withhold what is really going on then you need to consider the value of this friendship or relationship what does it say about your relationship with her if she will not tell you the truth i heard you say that i understand that you feel i appreciate that you agreed to talk about this with me but i get the sense that you re still not being completely honest can you share the whole truth with me i m really glad that we re getting the opportunity to talk about this however it seems like you have more you want to say but haven t yet go ahead and share give yourself time to process what she shares in the event that she does share with you what she has been hiding give yourself time to process it especially if it is something negative consider her reasons for hiding it from you and the validity of

how to date without your parents knowing,everybody s parents have some time when they want you to date but sometimes it s not when you want generally disobeying your parents and going behind their backs is not encouraged but if you must do so do it the right way this guide can help,consider how dating without telling your parents affects your relationship with your parents you re going to be lying to your parents constantly about something that is a big deal yes it is a big deal it matters enough to them to consider that you re not yet ready to date so you must really think through the consequences of lying constantly and the potential of being caught out think about the following before going ahead with dating without telling them you cannot share the joy of your feelings with your parents you are lying all of the time not just once twice or thrice but constantly that will wear you down eventually things are bound to slip up somewhere a mistaken word a chance meeting another parent making a comment your parents have a good reason for forbidding the dating perhaps it s best to talk about that reason thoroughly before making your decision remind yourself that you re still young you have decades ahead of you to find that special person this isn t a do or die decision even if it feels like it at the time think carefully about actually asking if you can date tell your parents that a guy or girl would like to date you and that you would like to do so explain that you understand they don t wish to permit it but give them plenty of reasons why you can be trusted and give them plenty of leeway to make conditions that control the dating such as being in a group only and getting home early after each date this may be much better than creeping about and lying all of the time read how to tell your parents you have a boyfriend for more information to help you hang around your date with other people this way your parents won t get suspicious as your date will be just one of the group use your best friend as an excuse if your boyfriend or girlfriend asks you on a date tell your parents that you re going out with your best friend who has to be the same gender as you your best friend must be willing to cover for you if needed another alternative is to say that you re going on a girls guys night out avoid using social media to connect think twice and even three times before using facebook or myspace to talk to your boyfriend girlfriend don t text your date loving stuff if your parents check your phone so often don t do anything that would make the fact that you re dating easy to notice like getting hickeys stay calm and on an even keel once you start dating a guy girl it s probable that you ll be feeling really excited and happy most people will notice this change or glow that has come over you and will surmise what s up it s going to be even more evident if you re normally morose or glum if your parent asks you what s up just say something like i just don t think that it s right to be gloomy all the time i m trying to change and be more appreciative of everything keep covering as best you can realize that this charade may have to go on for ages and that s something you ve got to carry within you and keep acting as if things are normal on the outside try to hide your relationship as much as possible until the pair of you break up or your parents decide you can start dating when they tell you that you can start dating come home from school the next weekday and tell them the news just be sure not to tell them you have a boyfriend girlfriend too quickly or you parents will get suspicious on why you happened to date right after them allowing you deny it if your parents pop the dreaded question do you have a boyfriend girlfriend tell them that you don t nor have you thought about getting one it s an outright lie and if they have evidence to the contrary realize that you ll have walked right into a trap and things will probably not proceed that well from here keep it from friends if possible if you can t hide it from your friends only explain it to a few mutual friends and make them swear not to tell anyone if they do tell someone tell them that you are upset and not to tell anyone else if the person that your friend told starts telling people tell them to stop if they don t stop tell them that it was a joke that you and your friend are playing on each other if your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to meet your parents be ready to explain explain why you can t do this at the time,Youth

you strike up a conversation with a girl learn to calm yourself down in the moment be as natural as possible keep it simple and straightforward by keeping the conversation short lots of times you ll be nervous because you think you won t have anything to talk about or you ll say something dumb we ll cover that in the next section ask questions instead of talking about yourself lots of people especially guys talk too much about themselves in conversation if you tend to do that when you re nervous try to switch tactics instead ask more questions and keep her talking about herself this helps to take the pressure off of you and lets you learn a bit more about her make your questions complication and probing but relatively light it s always good to ask what did you think of that test in chemistry did you feel good about it immediately asking a deep question about what she thinks of religion might be a little awkward use open ended questions if you ask how are you today it s easy to answer fine which doesn t give you much to work with ask a specific question that will take some time to answer how s soccer going this year look for something you have in common if you want to start a conversation and get to know a girl better look for something that you share this helps to build trust and companionship if you can talk about something regularly she ll know she can come to you about that subject if you re in class together you ve always got that to talk about talk about how you re doing how dull the teacher s lectures are and other class related topics try to study together

of humor it s much easier to talk to someone when you know what makes them laugh is she sarcastic goofy does she appreciate a good random line try to find out more about what she thinks is funny check out her facebook page or other social media what movies does she seem to like what makes her write lol be careful if you want to get to know a girl in a real way complimenting her space pants or asking her if it hurt when she fell from heaven usually isn t the way to go pick up lines while sometimes funny are the most shallow way possible to start a conversation unless you want eye rolls avoid using with lines 1 x research source follow up on something she has already said sometimes the second and third conversation can be a lot more difficult than the first once you ve covered the basic topics what do you talk about learning to follow up is an essential conversational skill ask about what she s been doing since you talked last how did that test go or how was your weekend are good follow ups even just asking hey it s been a while what have you been up to since we talked if you talk about a movie band or some other subject do a little research and bring it back up i listened to that band you mentioned i really like their second record what s your favorite don t argue even to be funny picking on a girl you like is what kids do in elementary school it s not a good way to get to know someone on a more personal level if you like someone and want to get to know them better avoid controversial topics and avoid an argument a common pick up artist tactic is to try to subtly insult girls to make them more vulnerable this isn t a good way to get to know someone eventually you can and should disagree with people that you like if you know her well you don t have to always be agreeable but at first don t make a point of picking on someone or they may get defensive or offended don t write a script when you get nervous sometimes it seems like having a script would be helpful most of the time this will come across as more awkward and uncomfortable than talking more naturally even if you re not a great conversationalist don t be a robot reading a script spend some time together one on one it s hard to get to know someone well in a group if you want to deepen your bond spend time alone together go somewhere you can have a quiet talk like a coffee shop or a restaurant in the middle of the day if you go to school together just finding a quiet place to sit away from other students can be a great way to have a private conversation it doesn t have to be a date and calling it one can put a lot more pressure on things just find an excuse to hang out together and talk ask more complicated questions eventually your conversation needs to deepen beyond talk of school and bands and movies if you want to get to know someone better ask about her opinions on serious issues find about what she thinks about talk the real talk stay informed about world events and politics ask about her opinions regarding recent elections or talking points find out what she cares about ask about her anxieties and fears what kind of a person is she what keeps her up at night

for a little cash doesn t need to turn into a major financial transaction if you need eight bucks for a movie ticket try asking one of your parents if you need more like 50 it may need to involve both of them small amounts of money may not be much of a debate for larger sums of money they will appreciate that you approached both of them and take the allowance seriously you may have one parent who is more sympathetic to childhood or teenage hobbies if you are only asking one make it that one prepare to explain yourself your chosen parent will want to know why you want money your answer will be crucial in determining whether you get it it will probably not be successful for you to lie about the reason so be honest there is nothing wrong with wanting a few bucks to get milkshakes with your friends or go to the movies a parent is more likely to give you money to fund an activity they support something school related an educational trip a reputable event etc after all this is the same rationale nonprofits use asking for charitable donations 1 x research source asking for money to buy an item might be easier to explain for example if you just made the school soccer team needing a ball to practice at home is pretty self explanatory if you re asking for something just for fun don t say it s not fair or i need it do say i know it s not something i need but i m willing to earn it have reasons to back up your initial request the ideal scenario would be that once you tell your parent what you want money for s he would give it to you without further questions however this won t always be the case tell them why the event is important to you and why it isn t just a regular saturday afternoon for example come up with two or three supporting reasons why the money is important for example if you need money to go to a movie you might have a few reasons ready like nicole wants to see a movie for her birthday and i promised her i would come to this birthday since i missed the last one or we ve been fighting a little bit lately and i really want to make it up to her by going to the movies with her on her birthday have an exact amount in mind this is where you get to show off your early budgeting skills which they should respect tell them exactly how much it will cost and leave buffer room for unpredictable expenses be honest about adding that amount in and they should be impressed with your ability to create a budget for example look up the exact price of a movie ticket add the two bucks you always give your friend for gas money finally say you want an extra three bucks for a soda or snack though you don t know for sure if you will need it if it is a more substantial cost for a road trip or dinner out with a date come up with as precise a number as you can your parents don t want you not to have fun they just need to know you have a mature understanding of budgeting be prepared to negotiate your parents may not be excited about throwing you the entire cost of your dinner date but they still want to help don t be intimidated by negotiation if you re honest about your needs and are willing to concede negotiation can easily help you get more than nothing 2 x research source if your parents give you an absolute no don t keep negotiating do leave politely and wait for a chance to bring it up again by offering a new favor offer something in exchange be willing to offer to do something you know your parents want for example they may want you to do the lawn more often so offer something chore related this part of the conversation will likely become controlled by your parents if they ask you to study more and pull up your grades this month in exchange agree to it 3 x research source following through with your promise will make them much more likely to barter with you like this in the future be polite nothing says i don t take money seriously more than rolling your eyes when they seem skeptical convey to them you value their parental guidance and concern by asking nicely and saying thank you making this an exchange between two mature parties will do wonders for your relationship with your parents consider whom you will ask by this point in your life you probably have an idea of which parent is more likely to give you a few bucks on the other hand if you need a substantial amount of money approach both of them together let them talk it over before you even make your case you also might ask both parents together if they tend to be more indulgent as a couple than as individuals don t mention this to your friends especially if they know your parents do talk to your siblings if your parents end up giving you money if you keep it secret and they find out it could cause resentment prepare to talk about your budget and spending as much as you might like to think that your budget is no longer your parents business asking them for money makes it their business they probably won t expect you to present them with a printed out spreadsheet of your projected and actual monthly expenses however giving them a rough estimate will go a long way in demonstrating that you have a mature relationship with money 4 x research source allowing your parents to see a basic breakdown of where your money goes may help them feel more confident in giving you money as long as your expenditures aren t frivolous in their eyes include a list of activities you participate in to earn money whether it be a job a freelance writing gig classes to further your education etc your parents will want to see that you re making an effort not just mooching 5 x research source don t lecture your parents about how to budget their money do make sure they can afford what you re asking for without affecting their safety net demonstrate your interest in school or work show them how you are doing well in school to make it even more enticing show them how you even plan to improve this makes your financial situation seem like a temporary problem not permanent it also makes you seem grateful for the support they have already shown you in your academic or early work career 6 x research source ask for a loan your parents may not deem it necessary for you to pay them back they may instead see this as an investment on their part however telling them you are prepared to work hard to pay them back will further demonstrate your financial maturity on the other hand actually agreeing to pay them back for money will teach you valuable lessons in money management you and your parents can negotiate the repayment plan as necessary they may want the money sooner they may want to charge interest etc be willing to work with them to set up a repayment plan you re all comfortable with,Youth
how to fall asleep for kids,the average kid between ages 6 and 13 needs 9 11 hours of sleep per night but nighttime fears general worries and poor bedtime routines can make this tough to achieve 1 x research source creating a consistent pattern for going to bed and a calming place to sleep can help a lot if fears or nightmares are your main problem comforting activities or talking to a trusted adult may solve your sleep troubles,place comforting items within view of your sleep space comfort items like teddy bears aren t just for little kids some adults rely on them too whether it s a favorite stuffed animal in bed or your favorite posters or drawings on the wall nearby choose a few key items that will help ease your mind as you drift to sleep 2 x research source a hanging mobile with butterflies action figures or whatever you like might also help once again these aren t just for babies try not to overload with comfort items though if your bed is packed with stuffed animals it might become a less comfortable sleeping space use a dim night light if you re scared of the dark a dark room is best for sleeping but a little bit of light is ok if it helps to calm you place the night light in a spot where it won t shine in your face and won t create any potentially scary shadows on the wall or ceiling 3 x research source if you have a major fear of the dark it may help to keep a small flashlight that isn t too bright nearby that way you can quickly check your surroundings if needed try a white noise machine if random sounds bother you if creaky floors street traffic thunderstorms or chirping crickets keep you awake a white noise machine might help quite a bit you can try using calming ocean waves raindrops or other soothing sounds to drown out the noises that prevent you from dozing off 4 x research source white noise machines provide a continuous background sound that can block out other noises without being distracting themselves alternatively you could try using the continuous hum of a fan a room humidifier or an air purifier skip scary shows and stories if nightmares are a problem it s best to avoid any screen time for an hour or more before bedtime but especially avoid scary shows videos or games this kind of content may make you have more frequent and more frightening nightmares 5 x research source the same goes for books skip the ghost stories and curl up with reading material that is familiar and calming talk to a grown up and draw pictures if you have nightmares if you wake up from a nightmare and can remember at least some of the details tell a parent or other trusted adult about it either the next morning or if necessary during the night talking about what you ve dreamed can help you to realize that it wasn t real and isn t something to fear 6 x research source it can also help to sketch a picture of your nightmare it might become less scary when you see it drawn out and you can even rip up the paper afterward if that helps discuss worries that keep you awake with a trusted adult if stress about schoolwork the big game coming up talking to that girl you like or your parents arguments keeps you up at night talk to someone about it you can talk with a parent or grandparent teacher school counselor or another adult you know and trust 7 x research source just telling someone about what is worrying you can be a big relief and might help you sleep better if stress is a major problem for you talk to your parent s about seeing a licensed counselor or child psychologist make your bed an inviting place to sleep add a soft pillow or two a comfy blanket and maybe a single stuffed animal to keep things uncluttered you want it to feel as though you could just melt away into sleep as soon as your head hits the pillow 8 x research source also try to use your bed only for sleeping instead of as your spot for homework checking your phone building legos etc this will help you associate your bed with only one thing sleeping keep pets tvs and other distractions out of your room it might provide some initial comfort to have a favorite dog or cat cuddle up with you in bed but pets tend to move around a lot and become distractions a stuffed animal that never needs to get up to use the bathroom is a better choice 9 x research source it s also best to keep distractions like tvs computers and cell phones out of your room especially at bedtime if you have to do your schoolwork on a tablet or laptop in your room for instance move the item to another room when it s bedtime if you need an alarm to wake up use a standard alarm clock so you can keep your cell phone out of the area it s also best to keep the alarm clock out of reach so you have to get out of bed to shut it off make sure the room is mostly dark and comfortably cool use blackout shades or curtains to keep the room as dark as possible use just a small nightlight if needed also use fans air conditioners heaters or just heavier or lighter blankets to reach your ideal sleeping temperature 10 x research source most people tend to sleep better in a slightly cooler room with blankets for warmth but you might have different sleep preferences manage the best you can if you share a bedroom if you share your sleeping quarters with a sibling you may find that your notions of ideal sleeping conditions are very different if they like it cooler than you add a blanket to your sleeping spot if they like it warmer point the fan toward you if they need a nightlight ask your parents to plug it in away from your sleeping spot 11 x research source if you can convince them to work on establishing a consistent relaxing bedtime routine along with you you ll both sleep better go to bed and wake up at the same time every day you ll sleep better and wake up more refreshed if you set up a consistent sleep schedule for every day weekdays weekends even summer vacation if you stay up late and sleep late on weekends for instance your body has more trouble figuring out when it s sleep time and awake time 12 x research source in the best case scenario you ll be able to convince everyone in your family to adopt their own consistent year round sleep schedules otherwise see if everyone can agree to slowly adjust their schedules for instance from the school year to summer vacation over several days or a couple of weeks that way the entire household routine isn t changed dramatically overnight move your bedtime back until you can wake up on time without help if you sleep on a consistent schedule say 9 00 pm to 7 00 am and are getting enough sleep for your body s needs you should rarely if ever need an alarm clock if you struggle to get up at the right time it nearly always means you re not getting enough sleep 13 x research source move your bedtime back by 15 minute increments every 3 nights until you start waking up on your own at the right time then use this as your consistent sleep schedule don t drink any caffeine within 5 hours of bedtime even small amounts of caffeine can affect people especially kids for hours after drinking it try to keep your caffeine intake to a minimum anyway but especially avoid things like energy drinks and soda after mid afternoon 14 x research source if you need caffeine to help you wake up or stay awake you aren t getting enough sleep avoid eating sugar before bed sugar will make you more energetic and make it harder for you to fall asleep instead of having a sugary nighttime snack try having lightly seasoned popcorn or nuts exercise for at least 60 minutes each day but not after dinner exercise is great for your health but working out too late in the day can give you a burst of energy and alertness that will keep you awake at bedtime instead aim to fit in your hour or more of daily exercise anytime before dinner 15 x research source the goal is to do moderate exercise which means you re breathing heavier but can still carry on a conversation gym class recess and play time after school can all count towards your 60 minutes exercising earlier in the day will help to tire you out for bedtime stop looking at electronics screens at least an hour before bedtime the blue light emitted by electronic devices with screens affects your body s internal sleep mechanisms and can keep you awake at night turn off the tv and put away your phone and tablet well before you start your bedtime routine 16 x research source reading an old fashioned paper book is a far better choice for bedtime take a soothing bath or do other relaxing activities develop a consistent routine that signals to your mind and body that it s time to calm down slow down and prepare to sleep a warm bath maybe with some calming bubbles added could serve as the first signal that your bedtime routine has begun 17 x research source you might also try deep breathing exercises meditation prayer or simply having a calming chat with a loved one read happy stories and write in a journal to clear your mind reading something that s calming and pleasing can help push your worries away for bedtime sometimes though it s even better to write in order to clear your mind pull out a journal and pencil and jot down what you accomplished today and what you look forward to doing tomorrow 18 x research source it s great to be able to focus on happy things in your journal but it s also ok to write about your concerns or fears taking the time to put them down on paper can help to get them out of your head just try to end your writing session on a positive note play relaxing music or count backward in your head put on a cd of your favorite soothing songs or sounds if that s what helps you drift off to sleep or try one of the time honored tricks like counting sheep or counting backward from 100 believe it or not they really can work 19 x research source focusing on something simple and inconsequential like 62 61 60 59 will help clear your mind of

how to become the most popular girl in your class,so you re sitting in class you look around you you see a group of girls sitting near each other laughing and having fun you re alone once again at your desk feeling sad and left out if you want to be and feel as much admired as those girls continue reading,be amicable and remain true to yourself an important key to gaining popularity is to remain friendly and optimistic as it can cause you to appear confident and draw people towards you make positive comments about others and be willing to help your classmates but remember to take care of yourself as well additionally when necessary express your true feelings and thoughts in an appropriate manner although being amicable can be a vital element to building a strong reputation you should be cautious about reining in too many emotions for the sake of maintaining an optimistic appearance otherwise you may eventually appear fake to others or pile unnecessary stress and pressure upon yourself build confidence even if you may feel insecure appearing self assured of yourself increases the chances of gaining attention approval and perhaps admiration small changes such as straightening your posture and walking with long quick strides can transform your appearance and cause you to appear confident when speaking to others you can maintain eye contact and speak in a slightly firm voice if others attempt to bully or demean you give them an assertive polite response for instance if a classmate calls you ugly you can tell them something along the lines of thanks for sharing your opinion or you can think whatever you want about me befriend different people a good way to gain attention and get gals and guys talk to you is to become friendly with your classmates as well as people outside of your class although it may not be possible to become close friends with everyone you can try to at least be on amicable terms with the majority of your class so that they think of you in a positive manner even if you dislike someone remain polite and neutral so that they cannot accuse you of being negative when maintaining friendships remember to be realistic and avoid overwhelming yourself with too many meetings and events depending on how many friends you have you may not be able to see them every day so do your best to spread your time among them if you cannot spend a lot of time with certain friends be sure to at least stop and ask how they are doing so that they do not feel abandoned or left out have a pleasant relaxed personality you can try being open and friendly towards others as long as you are comfortable furthermore while you should not erase your personality for the sake of popularity assess yourself and decide if there are any highly negative habits that may upset your reputation for instance if you have a tendency to be overly loud around others or spread rumors you can do your best to stop doing that remain updated about gossip although you should not partake in spreading rumors or become heavily involved in others personal lives you can keep an ear out for gossip so that you know about current events in your school however avoid blackmailing your classmates tearing down their character or fishing too frequently for gossip otherwise your reputation may be tarnished and others might view you in a negative light maintain your grades although it can be easy to ignore your studies in favor of fun you should remember your priorities you are in school to gain an education so that you are well prepared and equipped for a future career which can lead towards success your current surroundings and social circles will not last forever so it is important to prepare for the future furthermore having good grades will boost your reputation cause you to appear intelligent and perhaps prompt people to seek your assistance use social media presenting a positive image of yourself online can help you gain people s approval and give them a better idea of your personal identity follow your classmates and friends so that they may follow you in return post appropriate images that reflect your personality and interests and be sure to include various pictures so that they are new and unique for instance instead of solely posting selfies try to take pictures of different subjects such as your pets delicious meals friends

how to avoid backpack injuries in kids,when you think of all the potential health hazards out there when you send your kid off to school the pack of books and supplies on her back probably isn t on the list however half of all schoolkids carry backpacks that are too heavy which can lead to pain or even injury to the neck shoulders and back 1 x research source when you add injuries caused by trips falls swinging straps or buckles and the like you ll find that backpacks are a common cause of pain and injury for school age children 2 x research source fortunately with some sensible shopping smart packing and proper wear and use backpacks can be made much safer so don t let your kid say he doesn t bring any books home because he s worried about his health,know that bigger isn t always better just like a purse wallet trunk or garage the bigger a backpack is the more stuff will be piled into it and the heavier it will be forget about logos designs or brand names and choose a well constructed age appropriate pack that is the right size for your child if that means doing the bag shopping without the kid so be it 3 x research source if you can t cinch the straps tight enough to stay snugly over the shoulders or if the backpack sags well below the waistline when worn it is probably too big for your child look for padding and secure straps a backpack that has padded straps and a padded back that is the side that makes contact with the kid s back will be more comfortable and may help prevent pinched nerves in the neck area choose models with waist straps as well as these help to ensure better weight distribution and pack stability 4 x research source check that the straps are made of strong material are well attached to the bag and have sturdy but easy to operate buckles leather straps for instance might be more fashionable but often simply add more weight without adding strength check a backpack in use for frayed straps ripped canvas or broken buckles pick packs with more pockets backpacks that have one giant pocket are more prone to be overloaded with an assortment of books and who knows what else alternatively packs with more compartments and pockets can help reduce the overall max load and ensure that the pack s weight is less prone to shifting out of balance which can cause falls or back injuries 5 x research source backpacks with more compartments and or pockets can also help a disorganized child find what he needs more quickly consider the pros and cons of wheeled backpacks the proliferation of overloaded backpacks even among young children has led to the development of packs with wheels and telescoping handles akin to carry on luggage such packs can reduce the likelihood of back or shoulder strains but also can increase the likelihood of trip and fall injuries they also tend to be heavier than traditional backpacks which can cause increased strain when they need to be carried 6 x research source using a bag with wheels can also put stress on the shoulder of the arm that is pulling the bag if your child currently uses a bag with wheels it s best to make sure they alternate hands rather than using one hand all the time some school districts ban the use of wheeled backpacks because of the increased risk of students tripping over them in the hallway or on stairs check your school s policy before considering a purchase indeed tripping is the most common cause of backpack related injuries that require emergency room visits 7 x research source weigh the full backpack how do you know if your child s backpack is too heavy experts tend to recommend that children not carry packs that weigh more than 10 20 of the child s body weight with 15 as a common standard maximum 8 x research source weigh your child without the backpack then multiply the result by 0 15 then weigh the loaded backpack alone if it weighs more than your multiplied result it s too heavy for instance say you have an 80 pound child with a 17 pound backpack 80 x 15 12 since the bag weighs more than this amount it is too heavy by at least five pounds if your child has to lean forward to hold the pack on his back or complains of neck shoulder or back pain the backpack is likely too heavy regardless of what the scale says weed out unnecessary stuff once you determine that a backpack is too heavy your next task with your child s help should be to take everything out and decide what must stay and what can go use i have to have this in there because as your criteria not i might possibly need this sometime if 9 x research source remember every little bit of weight shed helps how many extra pencils does your child need does she really need that backup calculator a lot of seemingly important stuff can actually be ditched not to mention the superfluous stuff toys keepsakes last thursday s unfinished lunch that you ll find in a kid s backpack conduct a regular weed out every couple of weeks or so to prevent unnecessary accumulation of stuff balance the load as you refill the weeded out and lighter backpack pay close attention to how you fill it unbalanced or shifting loads can throw a smaller kid off balance easily and are more likely to cause discomfort or injury put heavy items like books in first then distribute smaller items throughout the additional compartments and pockets 10 x research source ensure a snug and secure fit in addition to reducing the overall load carried you can also decrease the likelihood of soreness or injury by making sure that your child wears the backpack properly the weight of the pack should be distributed primarily over the shoulders and upper back with the chest in support these are some of your strongest muscle groups 11 x research source straps should be snug without cutting into the shoulders the bag portion should be centered on the mid back with the bottom of the bag sagging no more than four inches below the waistline the bag should never touch the child s backside while being worn don t carry everything all the time ask your child to think of the backpack as a temporary conveyance like a delivery truck and not as a permanent home for her stuff like a motorhome she should use it to carry what she needs when she needs it to where she needs it load and reload it frequently with what she needs right then kids should use a locker and or desk as their primary storage spaces not their backpacks recommend that she make more frequent trips to lockers or desks in order to unload and reload the backpack with what she needs at that moment procrastination can also cause overload problems by causing a kid have to bring all her books home on friday for instance work with her to make sure homework and assignments don t back up to the point where everything needs to be done all at once it may be a long shot depending upon your school s budget situation but you may want to ask whether your child can have two copies of her textbooks one for school and one for home the adoption of e textbooks at least as a supplement for homework may be a more practical and cost effective solution 12 x research source avoid carrying a backpack on one shoulder make sure you educate your child about avoiding carrying a bag on one shoulder some kids may want to switch from a backpack that rests on both shoulders to one shoulder such as a messenger bag this can put stress on that shoulder in addition to the child hiking his shoulder up to keep the backpack in place this can lead to shoulder and neck pain if it is done on a regular basis both shoulder straps must be used to effectively balance the load even if slinging the pack over only one shoulder is considered cooler know the most common hazards most of the prevention measures for backpack safety involve strains and injuries caused by overweight loads however when it comes to injuries that lead to emergency room visits less than one fourth involve the shoulders 12 or back 11 and the most common cause of significant backpack injuries is tripping over one 28 13 x research source the majority of all er worthy backpack injuries involve the head or face hands wrists or elbows all likely spots for trip and fall injuries 14 x research source what does all this mean while it is important to take precautions against your child lugging around a backpack that is too heavy make sure she is just as vigilant about paying attention to her surroundings to avoid injuries caused by tripping over a backpack or being struck by a swinging bag strap buckle etc 15 x research

how to have a healthy sex life teens,sex or sexual experiences can be a great part of your relationship an enjoyable one time experience or something you re saving for later no matter which you choose this is a major decision that you and your partner should make together on equal footing and while it s no one s favorite topic you must be mature enough to face the risk of stds as well as the possible decision to raise a child abort a pregnancy or give up a child for adoption,understand pregnancy whether you are male or female you should educate yourself about pregnancy before any heterosexual activity here are a few basics that all sexually active people should know about pregnancy pregnancy can occur anytime that semen enters the vagina almost all pregnancies result from unprotected penetrative sex with the penis in the vagina pregnancy is extremely unlikely during oral sex anal sex or non penetrative sexual activities 1 x research source precum a fluid the penis releases in small amounts when aroused typically does not contain viable sperm unlike semen precum is unlikely to cause pregnancy 2 x research source learn about sexually transmitted diseases all types of unprotected vaginal oral and anal sex can spread sexually transmitted diseases stds 3 x research source you can only get an std by sharing fluids with someone already infected however many people have an std that does not cause visible symptoms and this can still be transferred during sex and cause major health problems such as female infertility the center for disease control recommends annual std testing for sexually active women under 25 and for men who have sex with men 4 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source men who do not have sex with men are at lower risk but should still be tested after risky sexual behavior some stds can take six months or longer to show up on a test if you and your sexual partner only have sex with each other you only need to be tested once get tested again if you suspect your partner has had sex with someone else or if either of you have used injected drugs with a shared needle use condoms condoms are the most common method of birth control among teens 5 x research source they are cheap easy to use and protect you from both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases make sure you are using them correctly male condoms reduce pregnancy chance to 2 per year when used perfectly but during typical use mistakes or lapses increases this to 18 6 x research source female condoms are slightly less effective reducing the chance to 5 when used correctly do not use a female and male condom at the same time 7 x research source using condoms and one of the methods below is an excellent way to protect yourself and your sexual partner consider birth control pills birth control pills are very effective at preventing pregnancy when a woman takes one every day 8 x research source they do not protect against stds the pill is available over the counter in many countries in the u s you need a doctor s prescription u s law prevents your doctor from telling your parents about your birth control however they may find out if you pay for it using your parent s health insurance birth control typically costs 15 50 per month so you and your sexual partner may be able to pay for it yourselves 9 x research source these pills are very safe for most women but may cause health issues if you have serious health issues related to your heart or blood smoking increases this risk birth control pills make your menstrual cycle more regular and may reduce unpleasant side effects such as acne and cramping track the fertility cycle women are most fertile during ovulation and for a few days afterward this usually happens on days 11 21 of a 28 day menstrual cycle where day 1 is the start of menstrual flow 10 x research source it s important to realize that most women do not have regular cycles so you can t predict exactly when this happens in advance this tells you when pregnancy is especially risky but you shouldn t skip protection at other times of the month sperm can survive for a few days in the vagina so sex before ovulation can still lead to pregnancy to track this keep a menstrual cycle calendar with signs of an approaching period if you want to be extra safe track your ovulation research other forms of birth control there are many other forms of birth control available from diaphragms to intrauterine devices for more information visit a reproductive health center such as planned parenthood or talk to a doctor or gynecologist teens are exposed to many myths about birth control and stds so don t assume everything you ve heard is true the withdrawal method where the man pulls out before ejaculation is not recommended by most experts while it does reduce pregnancy somewhat when followed correctly there is a risk the man will not pull out in time or change his mind after sex has started this method also offers no protection against stds 11 x research source decide whether you re ready for sex take some time alone to think through this decision ideally you should answer yes to all these questions before you have sex 12 x research source 13 x research source do you and your partner understand how pregnancy and stds work can you talk openly about the risk and agree on a method or methods of protection do you and your partner trust and respect each other would your partner listen if you changed you mind and said stop are your personal values compatible with the sexual experience you re considering would your family and community be okay with this if they knew if you answer no are you comfortable accepting that fact avoid sex for the wrong reasons sex can be a great way for two people in a healthy relationship to have fun and express their connection this isn t always the reason sex happens however be honest about why you want to have sex and understand which reasons are no good 14 x research source 15 x research source 16 x research source only have sex when you and your partner genuinely want to if one of you is pressuring the other put this to a stop and wait until both of you are ready don t have sex because you think everyone else is doing it most high school students have not had sex and the ones that do don t have sex very often don t have sex to save a failing romantic relationship it won t work talk with your partner once you re confident you re ready for sex talk to your partner you need to talk about previous sexual experiences possible stds what to do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy and your views on abortion and adoption tell each other why you want to have sex if you cannot talk to your partner about these topics you may want to postpone sex until the two of you are able to have the conversation make sure you re on the same page about what sex means to your relationship is it just for fun do you love each other is this an exclusive relationship plan ahead if it s the first time for one or both of you or even just your first time with each other you re going to need privacy and time to yourselves arrange your agreed upon method s of protection in advance so you don t miss an opportunity finding privacy can be difficult but try not to do it in your car this is illegal in some areas try to restrict yourselves to one of your homes while there are no other people around take your time there is nothing worse than a rushed first time go slow and explore each other s bodies foreplay is necessary to help you become aroused and comfortable this is especially important for women as arousal causes the vagina to become lubricated without lubrication penetration can cause significant pain go as far as you are comfortable a sexual encounter can mean playing with each other with your clothes on helping each other masturbate or having penetrative sex enjoy each other however you both agree to doing something once does not mean you have to do it again you and your partner are allowed to have a different comfort level on a different day have realistic expectations don t be mortified at a failure to orgasm or at rapid ejaculation these are common occurrences during first time sex or when you re feeling nervous also understand what a typical sexual experience is like instead of believing what you hear in boasts porn or romance novels the typical man lasts five minutes during penetrative sex before ejaculating 17 x research source some women take longer to orgasm than their partner or have trouble achieving orgasm from penile vaginal sex alone they can still enjoy sex and may choose to orgasm through assisted masturbation or non penetrative sex let each other change your mind if you want to slow down or stop say so there s nothing wrong with feel nervous or uncomfortable or even in pain the best way to deal with this is to take a break and go back to something you re more comfortable with you can try again when you feel ready whether that means in five minutes or next month continuing intercourse with a partner who asks you to stop is morally wrong even if it began as consensual sex in many regions this is legally considered rape or sexual assault talk about the experience with your partner afterwards did you enjoy yourselves was there anything that you especially enjoyed or that made you uncomfortable the more you can talk about it the more comfortable you ll be with each other and the more enjoyable your next sexual experience will be if you decide to do it again understand healthy anal sex among some heterosexual teenage groups most

relaxation exercises and water based lubrication can improve the experience 19 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source roughly 10 of

ready to have sex perhaps you re just not ready now or you may have decided that you want to wait until marriage before you engage in sexual intercourse if you are avoiding sex for religious or cultural reasons understand that some of the practices in this section may be considered sex by your community s standards engage in heavy petting what is it heavy petting is erotic contact between two people that stops short of penetrative sex vaginal anal or oral the risk of disease and pregnancy are greatly reduced though there is still a very small risk in either case depending on the level of intimate contact engage in non penetrative sex this can range from all clothes on dry humping to all clothes off touching sessions including mutual masturbation and sexual satisfaction because orgasm is generally part of the process it s safe to say this is sexual activity and does carry a low risk of pregnancy or disease however neither result is likely neither partner should feel obligated to perform other sexual acts to avoid intercourse engage in oral sex while oral sex can be pleasurable for both partners it is not without its risks pregnancy is not an issue but disease transmission is still possible the cdc reports that over 60 of u s residents between the ages of 15 and 24 have had oral sex compared to about 50 who have had vaginal intercourse 20 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source the cdc study also reports that patients visiting std clinics have shown that 5 10 have gonorrhea in the throat and can raise the risk for infection by chlamydia herpes syphilis and cancer linked hpv and recommends using safe sex techniques when performing oral sex refrain from having sex this may seem counter intuitive to an article on having a healthy sex life but consider this if 2 3s of teenagers are engaging in sex that means 1 3 are not also abstinence does not mean not feeling sexual it means not having sex if this is the choice you and your partner have made then do not be ashamed of it neither should you be ashamed to have sexual urges with your partner it would be unnatural not to there are some things you can do to help calm those urges and still share the kinds of intimacies that people in love share enjoy the make out session but keep your limits firmly in place if his or her wandering hands land where you don t want them don t just try to block the move with your body language move them away with your own hands and say no i m not ready for that they should get the idea immediately and respect you enough to stop that approach break off the make out session if it gets too hot for either of you to handle it s completely natural to feel desire but it s not required that you act on that if you find yourself suddenly overwhelmed with passion but are committed to remaining chaste for now simply back off a bit and say something like wow that s hot but i m not ready to go further right now let s go watch a movie if your partner doesn t understand or is insistent don t be surprised they may not be quite as ready to stop as you are and might be a little confused and flustered however if they remain insistent or demanding or even attempt emotional blackmail such as if you loved me you would keep going send them home to cool down and re think if you want to be in that situation with them again understand the risks surprisingly abstinence actually has a higher failure rate than condoms in preventing stds and pregnancy this doesn t mean you can get pregnant from kissing of course what this means is that a large number of abstaining teens lose their resolve and have some form of sex in the heat of the moment often without protection educate yourself about pregnancy and stds understanding these risks can help you stick to your plan or run out and buy a condom if you change your minds,Youth
how to cope with a controlling parent,it is common for children to feel like their parents are too reserved in letting them live their own lives sometimes this is because the child is just pushing boundaries and maturing a little faster than the parent realizes and other times it is because the parent is attempting to control the child s life there are many reasons for the need to control your child from being a perfectionist to being afraid that they will repeat your mistakes and parents often do not even realize that they are harming their child instead of protecting them,identify controlling behaviors some parents are demanding of their children but this does not always mean that they are controlling people who are controlling use certain tactics to control others the tactics can be obvious or subtle the behaviors can vary from outright criticisms to making veiled threats some signs your parent may be controlling include 1 x research source isolating you from other family members and or friends such as by never allowing you to spend time with friends or other family members criticizing you constantly about trivial things such as your appearance your manners or your choices threatening to hurt you or threatening to hurt him or herself such as by saying i will kill myself if you don t come home right now giving conditional love and acceptance such as saying i only love you when you keep your room clean keeping score of your past mistakes such as by listing off mistakes you made in the past as a way to make you feel bad or to get you to do something using guilt to get you to do things such as by saying i spent 18 hours in labor to bring you into this world and you can t even spend a few hours with me spying on you or otherwise not respecting your privacy such as by searching your room or reading the text messages on your phone when you leave the room accept responsibility for your actions though your parent s may be controlling you are responsible for

change your parent s just as your parent s are not able to control how you think or feel you cannot change the way that they think or feel you can change how you respond to them and sometimes this will change how they treat you it is up to your parent s when and if they will change their personality 5 x research source to force your parents to change would be similar to the control that they are trying to assert over you if you remind yourself of this you will be forced to accept that they can make their own decisions about changing distance yourself physically from your parent s most of the time people use emotions to assert control over each other this can take place in the form of anger guilt or withholding approval if you want to break the grip of a controlling person parent or otherwise you may have to distance yourself from him or her such as by spending less time together and calling less often if you still live at home especially if you are a minor then building distance might be hard however you can set boundaries between you and your parent seek help from a school counselor or teacher try not to get defensive cutting down on the time you spend with your parent may cause him or her to get upset and lash out at you if your parent complains that you are not spending enough time with him or her or accuses you of not loving him or her then try not to get defensive 6 x research source try saying something like i am sorry that you are upset i understand how that might be upsetting keep in mind that things may get worse with your parents before you start to see any improvement however it is important to maintain your distance and avoid being drawn in by threats for example if your mother threatens to kill herself if you do not come over then tell her you are calling 911 hang up the phone and follow through do not rush over to her house or give in to her demands cut financial ties with your parent s another form leverage often used to control a child is money if you have the ability to make your own money separate your finances from your parents it might be difficult but you need to pay your own bills buy your own things and budget for yourself not only will this make you more responsible it will also lessen the grip of a controlling parent 7 x research source this can be hard for minors also but not impossible to do in small steps even if you don t pay your own rent and utilities try to earn your own money for extra outings that you would like to do this doesn t mean your parents have to say yes but having earned the money to go to the movies eliminates one more barrier that a controlling parent can use refrain from asking for favors from your parents asking a favor of your parent puts them in the position to bargain if you want them to fulfill your need you ll have to do something in return while this isn t inherently bad it can quickly lead to you giving up your decision making power to them ask friends or other family members if you need help 8 x research source identify abuse if you are a child who is being subjected to abuse call your local child protective services or talk to someone at your school like a teacher or counselor abuse may take many forms so if you are unsure about whether or not you are being abused then try talking to a school counselor some of the different types of abuse include physical abuse which includes slapping punching restraining burning or injuring you in other ways emotional abuse which includes name calling humiliation blaming and making unreasonable demands sexual abuse which includes fondling or touching in inappropriate ways sexual intercourse and other sexual acts resolve the past holding grudges against your parent s or yourself is not a healthy way to repair a relationship therefore it is helpful to forgive your parent s for any mistakes they made you may also want to forgive yourself for how you reacted to those mistakes keep in mind that forgiveness is not about the other person it is important for your own emotional well being 9 x research source by forgiving your parent you are choosing to let go of the anger you feel towards him or her but you are not saying that what your parent has said or done to you is okay 10 x research source to forgive someone you will need to make a conscious choice to let go of the anger that you feel one way to do this is by writing a letter to your parent that you do not send in the letter express your feelings honestly about what happened why it angered you and why you think that your parent did these things 11 x research source then close your letter by writing something to the effect of i am not okay with what happened but i am choosing to release my anger about it i forgive you you can also say this out loud to yourself confront your parent s respectfully you need to tell your parent s how you feel and why you became distant in the first place there is no way for them to work on a problem that they are unaware exists do not be accusatory or disrespectful tell them how you feel not what they ve done rather than saying you took away my rights as a person a more constructive thing to say might be i felt as though i had no right to be my own person set firm boundaries for both you and your parent s once you begin to repair the relationship you want to avoid backsliding into old habits decide ahead of time which decisions your parent s can weigh in on and which ones they cannot also boundaries should be set for which decisions you can weigh in on for your parent s or what things you can ask of them 12 x research source for example you might decide that you might consult your parents about major career decisions such as what college to attend or whether or not to take a job offer however you might leave them out of more personal decisions such as who to date and whether or not to marry someone you could also refuse to weigh in on certain issues that your parents bring up to you such as love life issues however you might decide to offer your support if a parent is dealing with a major medical issue such as cancer or heart problems respect your boundaries in the relationship once boundaries have been set you have to respect them you cannot expect your parent s to respect your space and boundaries if you cannot do the same for them if you are having trouble with the boundaries set discuss it openly with your parents and seek a resolution 13 x research source when a problem arises in your relationship with your parents using team building speech may be helpful 14 x research source try saying something like i respect your boundaries but i feel like you might not always respect mine what can we do to ensure that both of our needs are being met address any infringements on your personal choices if your parent s are violating your boundaries you have to let them know this does not mean you need to be angry or upset calmly and respectfully inform your parent s that they are crossing the line and ask that it stop if they are serious about respecting you they will give you your space using humorous language can also be an effective way to deal with controlling people 15 x research source for example if your parent is constantly criticizing your career choice then try making a joke about it by saying something like note to self career does not please mother got it anything else take a break if problems continue if things begin to go right back to normal you may need to cut down on your time with your parents again this does not have to mean cutting off all ties to your parent s it often just means that things have gotten too close for them or you to follow through with the boundaries that both sides agreed to spend a little more time apart and try again later 16 x research source consider seeing a therapist if things do not improve in some situations the problems might be so severe that you will need to see a counselor with your parents to see any improvement if you have tried to maintain boundaries and it is just not working then talk to your parents about the possibility of seeing a therapist together try saying something like our relationship is important to me but i think we might need some help to have the best relationship possible would you be willing to see a therapist with me,Youth

where you know there will be beer you can say no i m not going i m too young and that s trouble waiting to happen if someone is pressuring you to have sex when you re not ready then let them know that

about you don t let it get you stressed you know the rumors aren t true and the people who really know you and care about you won t believe the rumors either don t waste your time getting stressed about it just hold your head up and keep doing you 2 x research source remind yourself that you can t control what other people say and do and if people are going to talk and gossip there s little you

for your friend if you ask an adult you trust to help with the situation tell your friend i think we should let someone who can help us know what is going on you can even talk to an adult without using your friend s name if you need to for example mrs carter can i to talk to you about a friend who s hurting himself be calm and respectful with authority figures there will be times that your teacher principal or even your parents stress you out they may be nagging you about grades getting onto you about something you did or didn t do or just being generally annoying you may want to ignore them walk away or say something smart but that will just get you in trouble you can deal with authority figures stressing you out in school by staying calm and respectful instead listen to what they are saying to you there may be something useful in what is being said you can tell them that they are stressing you by saying something like i m sorry but this situation is really stressing me out right now take a few deep breaths to calm yourself down and remember that adults are here to help you if you need to respond to a question or explain something then don t interrupt keep your tone calm and remember to say excuse me please and thank you for example if your teacher yelled at you for talking when you didn t you could say excuse me mrs peters it wasn t me talking balance school and your relationship although having a boyfriend or girlfriend can be fun it can also be stressful when you are also trying to balance school don t feel rushed or pressured to be in a relationship just take your time focus on school and focus on having fun when you do get into a relationship learn to set boundaries when in a relationship this means defining first for yourself then communicating to the other person what you are and are not willing to accept in a relationship you can set physical boundaries such as what you are ready to do sexually boundaries about your time making sure the other person knows you have softball practice on weekdays and must study afterwards so you can only hang out on weekends boundaries about behavior if the person insults you or becomes abusive in any way you will end the relationship and so on make your boundaries clear to the other person if they continually violate your boundaries or pressure you to do things you have stated you will not do then you can feel confident that this person is not respectful and is not a very good partner you never have to be in a relationship with someone just because they or anyone else wants you to for instance don t go out with someone you don t like just because all your friends are coupled up and you feel left out make sure that being in a relationship doesn t interfere with getting your schoolwork done learning to prioritize is an important skill that you can practice now while you may want to talk to the person for hours each night ask yourself if this is really necessary focus on the quality of the time you spend together rather than the quantity for instance send a sweet heart felt text as opposed to spending hours texting about nothing make time to socialize spend some time with your friends and classmates outside of school being around people you can talk to who support and encourage you will help you handle a lot of the stressful situations you deal with in school hang out with people that make you feel good about yourself and encourage you to be a better person get to school or class a little early so that you can chat a bit with your friends and classmates spend time with your peers doing activities or something not related to school for example you could meet one of your friends from class for coffee or tea go for a bike ride together or take a pottery class make sure you are socializing at the right time during class or other quiet times is not the right time and can get you in trouble make amends when you do something wrong if you find yourself in trouble for doing something wrong the best thing to do is to admit what you did and apologize for it it will be much less stressful for you if you make amends than if you try to deny it or act rebellious be honest about what happened you will feel better about not lying and your teachers and principal will respect you more for example you might need to say yes i did cheat on my history quiz apologize and try to repair any damage that may have been done by your actions for example you might need to say brandi i m sorry i spread that rumor i didn t mean to hurt your feelings or for instance mrs mcentee i m sorry i wrote my name on the desk i ll clean it off balance work and school if you are working and going to school at the same time you may find yourself extra stressed you may be having difficulty getting enough sleep getting your schoolwork done or trouble getting to school and work on time taking the time to figure out how to balance work and school can save you a lot of stress sit down with your parents or your supervisor and create a plan for how you can work but also complete your school assignments without a lot of stress consider alternative ways of going to school if you have to work to support yourself for example explore taking online weekend or night classes be sure that you give yourself some time off from both work and school so that you don t burn yourself out try to save a half hour each day for you to do something you enjoy like read a magazine watch a tv show or play a game talk about stress that adults are causing you sometimes it s not just your schoolwork

range should be and how best to reach it be realistic you may want to believe that there is some miracle fix that will let you shed five pounds in the week before school starts however any fad diet that promises such results is either a lie or detrimental to your health 2 x research source also even if they do work temporarily quick fix diets don t produce lasting results aiming to lose 1 and possibly at most 2 pounds per week is considered healthy for most people consult your doctor or dietitian give yourself time if you really want to lose weight before the new school year starts your

those times when your cravings are getting the better of you or your confidence is low if an organized weight loss program provides the support you need by all means utilize one you can be part of

diet 9 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source don t think of summer as a time to indulge in

or candy drawer when hungry between meals indulge occasionally diets that feel like punishment are doomed to fail the goal is to retrain yourself to see treat foods double fudge brownies or double cheeseburgers for example as just that occasional treats and not signs of failure don t make any of your favorite foods completely off limits you ll only obsess about them more and feel even worse if

physically active for 60 minutes most at least 5 days of the week if you are sweating at least a bit and breathing hard enough that it would be a challenge to sing but you can still make conversation then you are probably exercising at a beneficial level the 60 minutes of exercise does not have to happen all at once doing 3 20 minute sessions seem to be just as beneficial as 1 60 minute session

and it is also especially important during hot stretches hydrate before during and after exercising plain old water is generally more than sufficient and comes without all the calories sugars and additives of sports drinks in especially hot weather either plan your exercise for early in the morning or later in the evening or move your exercise indoors try dvds youtube videos or even games like

once classes start back up you can take advantage of being in less of a hurry 18 x research source don t drive when you can walk or ride a bike sure it s less than a 5 minute drive to your friend s

lunches can sometimes be as short as 20 minutes so big portions might seem like too much to eat in the allotted amount of time and therefore be ignored for example instead of packing a whole turkey sandwich try providing just half of a turkey sandwich this portion may seem more manageable in the time your child has to eat lunch 1 x research source pack a wider variety of food if you are packing smaller portions of food you can also pack a wider variety instead of providing a sandwich and an apple you could provide half a sandwich a few slices of apple crackers and some raw veggies providing a wider variety of food in your kid s lunch may encourage them to eat more because in addition to the portions being more manageable it will also provide them with options of what they want to eat for instance say you pack your child a turkey sandwich and an apple but they only eat half the sandwich and a few bites of the apple it could be that your child just wasn t in the mood for what you packed them that day had you packed a variety of things there s a good chance your child would find something in their lunch they wanted to eat 2 x research source include foods with different colors textures and shapes these can include colorful fruits and veggies with dips proteins like hardboiled eggs chickpeas or yogurt and whole grains like bread muffins or crackers 3 x research source you can even change the shape of same foods from day to day for example on one day you can cut the sandwich into triangles the next day you can use a cooker cutter to make it a star shape pack food that can be eaten quickly if time is a concern for your child you can encourage them to eat more by packing foods that are easy to eat fast for example pack sliced fruit instead of whole cut sandwiches into bite sized pieces or provide food that can be eaten with their fingers in addition make sure food packaging is easy to open it might even help to practice opening containers at home 4 x research source separate foods children often go through stages where they don t want their food to touch if your kid is not eating their lunch it s possible this could be the problem try deconstructing the food you put into their lunch rather than providing already put together options for example pack sandwich fillings like lettuce tomato mustard or mayonnaise separately and let your child put their sandwich together it could be they just enjoy making their own sandwich or maybe the contents of the sandwich make the bread soggy when it is pre assembled 5 x research source ask your kid what they want for lunch it could be your child is not eating their lunch because their tastes have changed or they re simply bored with what you re packing for them ask your child if there are any specific foods they d like you to pack and if it s feasible provide those foods for example maybe your kid hasn t been eating their sandwich because they don t like the type of bread you ve been putting it on making the sandwich on the type of bread your child prefers could fix the problem 6 x research source if you re having trouble getting your child to pick foods that are feasible to pack for lunch try giving them two choices and allowing them to pick between the two for example ask them do you want an apple or orange for your fruit or would you like your sandwich on wheat bread or in a wrap this will allow you to control the types of foods they eat but still involve them in the process 7 x research source ask your child to help you pack their lunch in addition to letting your child help pick out what foods they want in their lunch they may be more motivated to eat it if they also get to help assemble and pack it after your child has helped you choose what to take in their lunch get everything out and ask them to help you pack it into their lunchbox this can give your child a sense of pride and a boost of confidence depending on their age your child may not be able to help with every aspect of packing their lunch for example you probably don t want your preschooler wielding a knife to cut their sandwich in half have them help with what they can like bagging up fruits and veggies and arranging everything inside their lunchbox 8 x research source allow them to choose how they d like to carry their lunch you can also let your child choose how they d like to carry their lunch in a lunchbox or a brown paper bag for example allowing them to choose a new lunchbox might make them more interested in what s inside or maybe they ve outgrown the cartoon lunchbox they carried last year and are embarrassed to take it to the cafeteria ask your child why they re not eating their lunch there could be any number of reasons for this for example maybe they are tired of certain foods are spending too much time socializing at lunch or are being bullied in the cafeteria the best way to get to the bottom of why your child isn t eating all of their lunch could be to ask them try saying something like this i ve noticed you re not finishing your lunch most of the time can you tell me why it s important to have a good lunch so you can have plenty of energy for the rest of your day 9 x research source discuss the importance of eating lunch kids may not realize how important lunch is to their daily energy and concentration it could be helpful to talk about how eating lunch can help them get through the rest of their day for example let them know that foods like carbohydrates and protein provide their bodies with energy in addition let them know being hungry can affect their concentration and performance skipping lunch could cause them not to perform to the best of their abilities in school sports or other extracurricular activities 10 x research source contact a school employee if you didn t get an answer from your child about why they re not eating lunch you might want to set up a meeting with their school principle or lunchroom attendant to see if they can shed some light on the problem for instance maybe your child is too embarrassed or scared to tell you they re being made fun of during lunch a school employee may be able to tell you what s going on and give you some suggestions on how to fix the situation if this meeting uncovers any new information bring it up to you child so you can talk about it try saying mrs smith told me you ve been having trouble with another kid in the lunch room i want you to know i m here for you and would like to help you resolve the issue so you can get back to relaxing and eating your meal during lunch can you tell me what s going on pack a bento box you can fill a bento box with a variety of healthy foods like meat rice vegetables and fruit arrange the contents into appealing shapes such as animal faces stars or flowers for example you can make rice balls by cooking short grain rice roll it into a ball and then shape it into a rabbit s face use sliced carrots and peas to make the face on one side of the rice balls put melon cut into flower shapes on the other you can put put carrot sticks cut a sandwich into the shape of a cat s head and use small pieces of cheese to make the face and ears stack crackers beside the sandwich and make a small mouse shape out of cheese to put on top 11 x research source celebrate holidays with lunch create special lunches for holidays and other occasions this will help make the day extra exciting and it will create variety in your child s lunch it may encourage them to eat more of their lunch on that day for halloween peel oranges and use a food coloring marker to draw jack o lantern faces on them they will look like pumpkins 12 x research source on st patrick s day put only green foods in their lunchbox make them a wrap in a spinach tortilla match it with green grapes and a green cookie for valentine s day make a raspberry or strawberry jelly sandwich cut a heart out of the top slice of bread so that it looks like a red heart is appearing in the middle of the sandwich prepare wraps if your child does not enjoy sandwiches or if they are not eating the bread you might try making them a wrap instead place the ingredients in the center of the wrap and roll it up you can slice the wrap to make smaller pinwheel pieces that are easy for a child to grasp and eat if your child likes fruit make a strawberry wrap spread a little bit of cream cheese on the wrap pile spinach and strawberries on top and roll it up 13 x research source cut up some turkey and put it in a wrap with lettuce tomato and provolone cheese slices add dressings to fruits and vegetables if your child is hesitant to eat fruit or vegetables you can dress it up by adding chocolate peanut butter or other dressings these will make the fruit taste more appealing and it can encourage them to eat more of it slice apples and smear a little bit of peanut or almond butter on each slice 14 x research source slice celery in half and fill the inside with cream cheese add either plain or yogurt covered raisins on top to make ants on a log 15 x research source melt chocolate chips and dip strawberries into them let the chocolate shell harden in the fridge before packing them in your child s lunch,Youth

how to get children to eat more fruits and vegetables,although it s important that children eat a healthy amount of fruits and vegetables it can be challenging to get kids to eat enough of these foods kids often dislike vegetables because of their texture smell appearance or flavor or simply because eating a variety of healthy foods can disrupt a child s dietary routine you can make fruits and veggies more appealing to children by serving them in an appealing way modeling healthy eating yourself allowing children to help with the food selection and preparation and having age appropriate discussions with kids about the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables,model a healthy diet for your children children often follow the behaviors that they see their parents performing and their diet is no exception if your kids see you snacking on celery sticks tomato slices fresh pears and berries they ll be more inclined to try those foods themselves 1 x research source eating well is especially effective if you and your children sit down to eat together invite them to join you over a plate of sliced tomatoes and carrots kids often want to imitate their parents behavior and will want to try what mommy s eating when they see you snacking 2 x research source institute a one bite policy children will often decline to try a new vegetable simply because they dislike its smell or appearance or on an abstract principle of automatically disliking anything new make a rule that your kids have to try one bite of any food including chewing and swallowing the mouthful then if the child genuinely dislikes the vegetable they don t have to eat another bite 3 x research source however if your child does not like the food don t give up on that food forever try again in a few weeks as it can take many tries before a child may decide they like a new food often kids will find that the new fruits and veggies taste better than anticipated and won t have a problem cleaning their plate after taking the first bite of something new take your children vegetable and fruit shopping with you often kids will enjoy the experience of shopping for food and they ll find the vegetables and fruits bright colors and fun shapes appealing let your kids pick out a few new fruits and vegetables that they want to try and allow them to watch as you prepare the food in the kitchen 4 x research source if your kids are old enough they could even help pick out a vegetable based recipe or help you prepare the meal 5 x research source depending on your location and the time of year you could also take kids to pick fruits and veggies in their natural environment for example an apple orchard or berry patch after you bring the produce home let your children taste fresh uncooked fruits and vegetables to show them that there s nothing wrong with the produce in question if you are able start a garden and grow some healthy vegetables and fruits with your kids incorporate vegetables into your cooking there are many delicious and kid friendly recipes that incorporate vegetables and fruits if kids find that there are fruits or vegetables in the food that is being served in front of them they may be more inclined to eat the fruits or veggies if your children dislike seeing the vegetables in their plates or bowls serve them in an unrecognizable form for example run the vegetables through a blender to make them less noticeable then mix the veggies into a soup or a curry try new methods of preparing vegetables if you kids haven t enjoyed vegetables in ways they ve eaten before change the way you re cooking veggies try roasting them roasting vegetables brings out their sweet flavor and changes the texture as well since the vegetables become crispy and slightly caramelized in the oven roast items including bell peppers carrots broccoli zucchini and tomatoes 6 x research source try cooking vegetables in a soup butternut squash soup is delicious and kids shouldn t mind the texture broccoli cheddar soup is another vegetable heavy option that kids may enjoy especially if they get to add more cheese to their own bowl of soup vary the vegetables and fruits that you cook this will have two benefits 1 you ll expose your child to a larger number of healthy foods and 2 you ll be able to feed your child different types of nutrients when planning daily or weekly meals plan to offer at least one veggie or fruit that s high in vitamin a like carrots or sweet potato one that s high in vitamin c like oranges bell peppers or broccoli and one that s high in fiber such as celery 7 x research source just like adults children will have natural likes and dislikes when it comes to fruits and vegetables if your child sincerely dislikes broccoli serve more dishes with a vegetable that you child prefers serve vegetables and fruits for snacks kids often get hungry during the day and will ask for a snack although they re likely to prefer an unhealthy option such as potato chips or a candy bar you can influence your kids to eat healthier by serving them fruits and veggies rather than giving them the option to choose the snack simply set a plate of fruits or vegetables in front of them if your kids are surprised and ask for a sugary snack instead try saying maybe you can have that next time you re hungry but right now we re having apple slices as our snack occasionally you may need to reward your children for eating healthy food such as fruits and vegetables rather than threatening to punish kids if they don t finish their vegetables say something like after you eat your corn you can have a cookie for dessert or better yet reward them with a non food item such as a sticker or time to play their favorite game let your kids eat fresh fruits and vegetables raw children are often put off by the limp soft or mushy consistency of cooked vegetables letting them eat the produce raw will let the vegetables retain their crunch a texture that kids often find amusing or fun if they like the texture well enough kids may even start asking for raw veggies as a snack 8 x research source cut up raw fruit and vegetables to make them easier and more fun to eat if your children struggle to eat raw vegetables such as carrots or celery serve them with a side of ranch dressing hummus or peanut butter although this will add some fat and calories to the raw veggies it may motivate your kids to eat the veggies 9 x research source sneak fruits and veggies into foods you prepare for parents with the pickiest children who may refuse to eat fruits or vegetables in any form you may need to add vegetables to your child s food without telling them for example if you re preparing kid favorites like pizza macaroni and cheese or hot dogs top the dishes with veggies before serving basil leaves and chopped tomatoes for pizza peas and chopped carrots for mac and cheese and pickles onions and bell peppers for hot dogs 10 x research source smoothies are also a great way to add fruit and vegetables to your child s diet try making your child a smoothie with some fresh or frozen fruit and a handful of greens like spinach or kale some vegetable based breads are sweet and may remind children more of eating cake than of eating vegetables banana bread or muffins carrot bread or carrot cake and zucchini bread or variations on these breads may be tasty enough to make kids forget that they re eating vegetables if you re desperate pureed vegetables such as tomatoes squash can be served in pasta sauce kids usually won t notice the slight change in texture and flavor another option is mixing some carrot juice into orange juice kids shouldn t notice the difference you could also try prepared vegetable and fruit juices such as v8 present dietary facts in a way that your child can understand inform your child that eating a balanced diet is important fruits and vegetables are a great source of vitamins minerals and dietary fiber you ll need to take your child s age into consideration with this strategy state the importance of a healthy diet in a way that your child can understand 11 x research source some of the many benefits of eating fruits and vegetables every day include helping children and teenagers grow and develop boosting vitality and energy reducing the risk of obesity and other chronic diseases such as heart disease and high blood pressure 12 x research source teach your children to eat sugar in moderation too much sugar in a diet may increase the child s chances of developing diabetes and other problems such as obesity and cavities convince your child of the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables most kids aren t too concerned about their health and find words like fiber vitamins and nutrition to be abstract terms 13 x research source be imaginative with your explanations explain that vegetables will help kids grow bigger and stronger for example pretend that your child is a dinosaur who needs to eat several trees of broccoli to stay strong try telling your child something like i bet that batman always eats carrots that s why he s so strong you could bring sports into the discussion if your kids are athletic explain to your children that doing sports and having an unhealthy diet just doesn t work say something like if you don t eat enough vegetables you won t have the energy you need to play soccer encourage your child to eat their daily recommended serving size the american academy of pediatrics has established guidelines stating that children should eat two to three servings of fruit per day as a broad rule children should eat fruits and veggies with every meal and these should fill roughly half of their plate 14 x research source this breaks down by age group toddlers 1 3 years a single serving of fruit equals ¼ cup of cooked frozen or canned fruit ½ piece of fresh fruit half an apple or pear for example ¼ to ½ cup of fruit juice young children 4 6 years a single serving of fruit equals ¼ cup of cooked frozen or canned fruit ½ piece of fresh fruit half an apple or pear for example 1 3 cup of fruit juice older children 7 10 years a single serving of fruit equals 1 3 cup of cooked frozen or canned fruit 1 piece of fresh fruit ½ cup of fruit juice,Youth

how to avoid chavs,this article is to help those who do not wish to be bullied verbally and or physically by those we call chavs,recognise what a chav actually is surprisingly a stereotypical chav is somebody who wears burberry polo shirts with upturned collars tracksuits bling and listens to hip hop rock n b drum n bass etc they are normally rude to everyone including if not especially their best friends have extremely bad manners and a terrible command over the english language the almost total inability to talk properly is a staple of chavs a chav can also be identified as someone who tries to act like they are black or possibly jamaican but ironically sometimes secretly or not so secretly harbours racist views they have also proved time and time again to be bullies avoiding someone simply because they look like a chav or enjoy chavvy things is no better than being a chav who often hate or at least look down on those who display different characteristics to their own someone who dresses like a chav may even be a nice person by instantly judging anyone that looks like they may be a chav you are in fact no better yourself avoid chavvy areas it is well known that chavs are usually found in large groups gangs and even posies it is well known that chavs can be found in poor urban areas it is often a fair judgment to say that any poor urban or suburban area is likely to contain a large number of chavs spend as little time in such places as possible or better still steer clear of them altogether chavs are infamous dwellers of council houses and these too are likely to have at least one chav in every one of them keep away from large or notorious council estates as much as you can city centres are often favourite haunts for chavs who will gather there in large groups especially in the evenings avoid chavs at school many schools especially those in deprived areas have a large population of chavs they are often seen as the toughest kids and may even dominate the school this can be a problem if you wish to avoid them do not panic this can be easily achieved think to yourself where would a chav choose to hang out at school where would a chav rarely go it is likely that there are quiet corners of the school that can act as a refuge or safe haven for you and your friends if you are an accomplished and hardworking student you will likely be in higher classes or groups where few chavs are admitted this is not the case with all schools though the key is to remember that groups of chavs will likely cause trouble and try to cause you some sort of grief they can be very childish throw things around the classroom insult teachers seek attention and even blatantly bully other students however one chav is much less of a threat only the most tragically disturbed chavs continue their anti social behaviour when they are left alone a chav in a classroom of normal children usually goes into a state of quietness until they are reunited with their chav friends it is even possible that a chav if not with their own kind might occasionally do something that can be considered as a friendly gesture sometimes such interaction with a lone chav may gain you some sort of respect and safety from their group as a whole and you may be described as safe but talking to a lone chav should not be seen as a guarantee of some sort of protection against the rest it is likely you will become another victim as soon as a chav is surrounded once more by their crew join an anti chav student alliance at your school this is a group of good respectful students who work against chavs using more powerful tactics than just pure violence and unintelligible language such organisations will provide support to the vulnerable and if you want to make a difference you can help ask senior students in your school about this avoid chavs close to you sometimes it is impossible to avoid chavs who are family members friends of friends etc however if one is trying to trouble you there are still a few things you can do try to look confident do not show any fear as chavs can sense it almost like dogs be nice smile and try to be upbeat do not speak unless you are spoken to but try not to appear miserable you will be even more of a target for bullying avoid eye contact never stare at a chav this is especially important if you see chavs in the street chavs are actually extremely insecure which is why they attempt at displaying such a mean bad boy attitude and staring at them almost always provokes hostility try to act invisible but do not ignore chavs if they try to communicate with you this may infuriate them instead try to keep a low profile and don t do anything that may make you a threat or a victim in their eyes,Youth

their age preferably you should have an idea of what they look like as well and contact information if your date does not want to give out their telephone number before asking for your own that is considered sketchy do not be lulled into a false sense of security just because you know someone 8 out of 10 rape victims know their assailant 1 x research source have a healthy amount of skepticism

place for a first meeting 5 x research source the ideal first date location should be a place that is public and where there will be many people like a restaurant movie theater or a club it is

double date so that you re sure to not be alone be responsible for your own transportation police recommend that you never tell a date where you live early on in the dating stages you do not want an

is no excuse or reason dress for mobility if you have to leave a situation or walk a block to get to the bus stop be sure you can do so without getting blisters tottering on too high heels getting frostbite or otherwise unable to simply go if you need to pack the appropriate items make sure that you never leave for a first date without your cell phone and a wallet with cash if you end up splitting the bill for dinner avoiding using a credit or debit card means that you won t leave behind a paper trail that could link you to your workplace or home address 8 x research source you will need your cell phone to send and receive texts and phone calls and it may be handy in case of an emergency although some people may feel they are unnecessary bringing mace and or a rape whistle on the off chance your date turns violent could prevent you from becoming a victim and should be very seriously considered courtesy text your friend make sure that you respond to your friend that you asked to make sure you re okay you don t want them to become falsely alarmed additionally you can text them when you re arriving to the location when you re leaving and when you make it safely back home it would also be polite to let them know if your date is going long ask good questions while you re on your date of course you will have the opportunity to talk and get to know each other better don t waste this opportunity with small talk about the weather or your food use it to ask meaningful questions like if they have any close friends what their family was like growing up and what their current most important goal is 9 x research source questions like these will reveal to you what kinds of values and mindset your date has and give you greater insight as to whether this is someone you d be interested in continuing to see be assertive only you can determine for yourself what you are comfortable with whether it s if you want to move on to a more intimate setting reveal more detailed information about yourself or engage in sexual activities if your date starts to pressure you for things you are not ready to do don t feel like you have to give in to their desires just tell them a polite but firm no a good partner will not be impatient and will respect your boundaries and opinions someone who continues to pressure you after you have said no is putting off a very strong red flag watch out for disturbing behavior listen to the things that your date is saying and be on the look out for warning signs 10 x research source a date is the time for a person to be putting their best foot forward to impress you and their behaviors will only become more relaxed with time if they are behaving in ways that make you uncomfortable or anxious this will probably not improve over time they show up inappropriately angry or in a bad mood which may or may not become directed toward you they treat the waitstaff employees or strangers at any place where you meet poorly or aggressively they refer to their exes or members of the opposite sex using derogatory language or call them crazy they insult you or put you down they tell you information that directly contradicts things they ve told you previously ie it looks like they re lying to you they make strange comments that seem out of place like talking about their machete collection or punching exes 11 x research source they ask questions about your or offer details about their sexual or marital history that seems inappropriate for a first date they start making explicitly sexual comments or advances or reveal their genitalia in public places trust your instincts your brain has a way of trying to communicate with you when it recognizes logically that something dangerous or unsafe is happening by manipulating how you feel we often call these feelings gut instincts when your brain registers that something unsafe is happening it will create feelings of unease and tension in your stomach 12 x research source do not be afraid to listen to these feelings do not fall into the trap of feeling like you have to explain away or excuse a date s bad or strange behavior stay sober there s nothing wrong with going out for a drink but it s generally inadvisable to get drunk drinking leads to lowered inhibitions the reduced ability to assess risks and make good choices impedes the ability to give consent and makes it harder to fight back should someone try to sexually assault you 13 x trustworthy source us office on women s health u s government agency providing resources for women s health go to source it can also lead people to being aggressors of sexual assault try planning a date during the daytime when you normally won t be expected to drink anyway also more people are out and about during the daytime which can give you some extra security 14 x expert source collette gee relationship coach certified violence prevention specialist expert interview 1 may 2020 if you do order a drink from the bar opt for a bottled beer and make sure it s opened in front of you 15 x expert source collette gee relationship coach certified violence prevention specialist expert interview 1 may 2020 don t leave your drink unattended regardless of what you are drinking whether it s alcohol or water do not leave your glass unattended even to use the restroom ghb ketamine and rohypnol are all fast acting drugs commonly referred to as date rape drugs that can be slipped into a beverage without you ever knowing it 16 x research source only accept drinks directly from a bartender or waiter don t even let it pass through your date s hands if you leave for the restroom and come back and forgot to finish your drink off before hand ask for a new one if your date has a problem with that the issue is with them not you be prepared to split although it would be nice to be honest if you re not into a person or not feeling safe with them it is impossible to tell how someone may react to hearing that kind of statement particularly if you re feeling unsafe there may be good reason for that and you don t want them to react violently so have some reason prepared for just in case and don t be afraid to use it if you arrived by public transportation you could say that you have to leave to catch the bus if your friend drove you say that they have to pick you up early because they had a schedule conflict on their end get your friend to text you about a sick pet or a breakup and say that you re needed elsewhere leave if your date appears to violent emotionally unstable or makes you uncomfortable for any reason it is okay to leave use any of the excuses that you have prepared and get out of there if you are truly desperate and don t want them to know you re leaving tell them you re going to the bathroom and take any personal items with you then sneak out another way get assistance if your date tries to prevent you from leaving physically or through verbal coercion get someone nearby to help you like a waiter or another couple this could be as simple as asking them to get the manager or call the police but the point is that by drawing other people into the situation an aggressive person is more likely to back off out of a desire to not get into trouble get loud although embarrassment might make you want to keep quiet and not make a spectacle it is to your advantage to be loud and make sure other people can hear that you are not interested in this person s advances or company this may convince people without your solicitation to come help you fight back if for some reason you should be cornered and there is no way to avoid violence use proper self defense techniques to make your assailant back off if you have it with you using mace is perhaps the easiest method when attacking aim for the areas of the body where you can do the most damage in the least amount of time these include the eyes nose ears neck knees and groin 17 x research source kick the side of the knee to injure or even incapacitate an attacker gouge poke or scratch an attacker s eyes with your fingers or knuckles if your attacker is very close to you user the heel of your palm to strike the under portion of their nose throwing the whole weight of your body into the motion the goal of attacking your attacker is not to beat them up but to prevent them from following you and in the case that they are holding you make them let go get somewhere safe once your attacker lets go run away preferably in the opposite direction if your attacker recovers and gets a hold of you after being hurt they will likely be very angry so the situation will be even more dangerous for you go somewhere where there are a lot of people or get into your car to drive away do not immediately go back home should this person be capable of following you you do not want to accidentally show them where you live call 9 1 1 if you have been attacked this is considered an emergency situation you will want to call 9 1 1 so that police can be dispatched to help you and if necessary make an arrest be prepared that when you contact the emergency operator you will need to try to tell them exactly what happened where it happened and where you are now 18 x research source stay on the line a sudden disconnect could mean that something has gone very wrong for you and the operator will try to call you back this could delay emergency response time and tie up the lines so be sure to stay on the line until you are told you can hang up,Youth

how to keep kids safe on the playground,playgrounds are tons of fun for children of all ages but they can also be dangerous many injuries occur on playgrounds because of unsafe or poorly maintained equipment lack of supervision or improper use of equipment if you carefully inspect the playground before allowing your children to play there and follow some basic safety precautions you can greatly reduce their chances of getting injured on the playground,look for signs of poor maintenance before your children start playing on a playground it s a good idea to look the equipment over to see if you notice anything that might suggest that it has been neglected such as rotting wood or missing bolts if you find anything like this it s best to choose another playground 1 x research source when using swings make sure that the s hooks that hold the chains to the posts are completely closed make sure there are no nails or screws protruding that could cause injuries if the equipment is made of wood make sure that it is not splintering all equipment should be properly installed and secured to the ground make sure platforms have railings to prevent kids from falling it s very important that tall platforms have proper railings around them if you notice that these are missing do not allow your child to play on the platforms 2 x research source any platform that is 30 inches or more above the ground should have a railing the slats of the railings should be no more than 3 1 2 inches apart in order to prevent children from getting their heads stuck between them check the slides carefully slides can cause serious injuries if there is any foreign debris on them so always take a very close look at them before allowing your children to use them 3 x research source if it is warm outside touch the slide with your hand to make sure that it is not hot enough to burn your child this is especially important for metal slides but plastic slides can get hot as well it s also a good idea to make sure that there are no other children at the bottom of the slide before you let your child slide down especially if the slide twists so that children can not see the bottom of the slide from the top note the placement of swings swing sets can also be dangerous especially when they are placed too close to other playground equipment pay attention to how much space there is behind and in front of each swing and make sure that there is adequate room so that a swinger would not hit children playing on other equipment 4 x research source to be safe the distance between the swing and any other equipment should be at least twice the height of the swing set there should be at least six feet of space between the swing and any wall tree or fence swings should also be at least 24 inches apart from each other to prevent children from swinging into each other look for dangerous moving parts any playground equipment that has moving parts such as a seesaw should be carefully inspected to ensure that a child s hand could not be pinched or crushed in the mechanism 5 x research source to be safe these moving parts should be out of a child s reach or completely covered be cautious of sandboxes public sandboxes can be unsanitary and potentially dangerous so always inspect them carefully it s best to avoid sandboxes unless you are sure that they are well maintained 6 x research source don t allow your children to use a sandbox if it is not covered at night an uncovered sandbox attracts animals which may contaminate the sand with feces always check the sandbox for debris and insects before allowing your children to play in it look for soft surfaces serious injuries from playground falls are much less likely when there is a soft shock absorbing material on the ground try to only visit playgrounds that have surface materials like rubber sand or mulch avoid playgrounds with lots of concrete or asphalt 7 x research source while grass or dirt surfaces may seem safe they do not absorb shock very well so they can be almost as dangerous as a paved surface check the ground for debris in addition to inspecting the playground equipment you should also pay attention to the ground in the playground area make sure there is nothing on the ground that could cause an injury such as broken glass 8 x research source standing water can also be dangerous as it can cause kids to slip inspect for trip hazards when looking at the ground you should also pay attention to anything that may cause a child to trip and fall whether it is part of the equipment or part of the natural landscape 9 x research source tree roots and rocks are potentially tripping hazards anything that has a sudden change in elevation including sidewalks may also pose a danger pay attention to the fence if the playground is in a busy area you should always check the fence to make sure that it is secure enough to keep children in the playground area a faulty fence could allow children to run into traffic or other unsafe conditions 10 x research source the fence should also not be sharp or rusty as this could cause injury to a child supervise your children the best way to prevent common playground injuries is to supervise your children while they are playing if you keep a close eye on them you can prevent them from doing something dangerous that could cause them to get hurt 11 x research source intervene if you see your child leaning over a railing climbing on equipment that is not intended to be climbed on or doing anything else that may be unsafe if the playground is not designed in such a way that it is easy to supervise your children find a new playground make sure your children use age appropriate equipment children can get injured when they try to use playground

uncomfortable just walk off bullies gain satisfaction from making others feel hurt or uncomfortable so giving them a reaction may only encourage them further instead make them look silly by just leaving them to it they ll find themselves shouting horrible things for no real reason be consistently non reacting the tactic of not reacting to a bully may backfire initially depending on the bully read the situation carefully some will feel safe tormenting you as they enjoy that action itself if they see that you aren t suffering from their actions however given a little time such as days and weeks most bullies will give up because your deadpan reaction becomes boring and they realize that they truly can t break you keep with it be aware that you cannot talk sense to an irrational person walk away with dignity saying you have better things to do with your time and mean it fill your time with things you enjoy doing as it serves as a great distraction and builds your talents instead of

how to cope with being hurt online,much of the time the internet is a great resource for learning sharing and connecting with different people across the globe but new opportunities also means new opportunities to experience rejection insults and lots of unwanted contact with people whose presence we can only do so much to limit some aspects of coping with hurt online are different from coping with the same troubles offline and some aren t here are some ways to deal with hurt from unfriending insults on social media and cyberbullying,acknowledge your feelings just because the rejection occurred online that doesn t mean that you won t still be feeling the strong sadness of being broken up with ignored or excluded ostracism is inherently painful our basic needs for belonging and recognition are unmet 1 x research source knowing your feelings surrounding the rejection will allow you to slowly start to let them go creating the distance needed to heal the idea here is simply to let yourself feel some of this hurt how rejection feels to you so that you can tell when you re over the incident feeling your feelings will also help you get back in the game the next time you show interest in someone s profile and start dating you will not be harboring resentment or defeat from the previous setback take a step back from the situation moving away from the incident can help you to work out what has happened with greater clarity take the time to assess your own behavior that could have caused the rejection or unfriending 2 x research source staying online will keep you hurting and without the crucial distance to see if some of your online habits are off putting to others like making crude comments or posting excessively for instance some people are very good in person they smile flirt and make eye contact but that same person might not know how to communicate very well through text appearing cold and distant time examining your online personality can show you quirks and features of your behavior that you may want to be aware of try taking a week long break from the particular site or even off the whole internet to give yourself the space to come to terms and reflect especially if the relationship was exclusively online give yourself time before making a new connection on the same dating website put the exclusion in perspective the best thing about online friends and suitors is that there are so many of them enough that you don t need to get attached to any one person or site 3 x research source take advantage of the fact that if someone unfriends dumps or ignores you online there are plenty of other fish in the sea you may even embrace having the incompatibility between you and the person brought to your attention consider but don t dwell on the other s qualities that you find unattractive in order to move on this way you won t feel tempted to continue pursuing the person or interrogating them about the rejection and you can move on fluidly resist the urge to take it personally 4 x research source when others reject us it is not because of anything we could or should have done better more often than not it s the person s reaction against something we ve done that feels threatening to them 5 x research source ruiz miguel janet mills and miguel ruiz 2008 the four agreements thorndike me center point pub for instance say you ve been rejected on an online dating site since most people lack insight about their relationship patterns they may be unconsciously looking for a person who can fulfill that pattern 6 x research source in many instances the problem is with the match rather than baggage you carry into all situations seek support from friends and family if the source of your pain is online a good way to create distance is to shift the focus of your social life 7 x research source make it a point to do most of your dating and socializing face to face while you re getting over the rejection this way you ll see that people you talk to online are only one of many sources of closeness and connection in your life if possible shorten your time spent on the internet if you fill your time with sharing experiences and getting outside instead you will be less likely to ruminate on the situation 8 x research source it s the equivalent of taking a vacation when dealing with a painful issue that arises close to home take time to consider your next move make sure that you do not make a public response to the insult unless you have allowed a little time to collect yourself first take some deep breaths because we cannot use tones and gestures to clarify where we re coming from it is best to think deeply about how you use your words before jumping in gather the facts size up the insult the offender and the context so that you can respond to or ignore the insult to best recover your reputation and your dignity consider the following information is the person behaving in a way that is aimed at intimidating you will this insult hold weight for other people in your network does it bring to light any real current issues is this someone with whom you have a history of not being able to see eye to eye how do you feel about continuing to be a part of that site or community did you receive an overly rude and vengeful scolding in response to your activity on the site consider your own role too have you played any part in escalating conflict with this person accidentally or on purpose decide to respond or ignore the insult sometimes simply ignoring the insult is the best way to respond this is usually the case when the insult is very petty and clearly misinformed a response is appropriate if it is important for controlling the damage done to your image and not just defensively trying to strike back remember that responding can further provoke the offender and a stream of conflict can be more damaging to your online presence than the original insult for example if the insult is in response to your critical opinion of drilling for oil in the arctic and it says you you hippie you may want to just ignore it if you do respond keep it brief countering an attention seeking insult with a cool measured reply will present as having the care to consider what was said and the wherewithal to see its pettiness you can try a response like i m disappointed that my attempts to bring a social issue to light has not been effective after you give a brief public response you can choose to continue the conversation between you and the offender you might start by saying i can t respond thoughtfully when i am being called names in front of my peers why don t we find another private way to communicate then you can carry on the conversation from there depending on whether or not you aim to return to the content of the insult report violations and abuses there are always options available on facebook and other popular social media venues to block the offensive user and delete or privatize content that you don t want to be public twitter also provides a form where you can report abusers of the site and give information about their behavior choose web affiliations wisely know that there are things you can do to protect yourself from insults in the future people are much more likely to use insults and hurtful language when others do so 9 x research source so if you notice a community or posting thread with lots of hostile or rude remarks avoid jumping in one good way of coping is to avoid getting too attached to any single site online forums blogs and websites tend to be great meeting places but the insults can be intensified if you feel that you are committed to a site that is becoming threatening getting involved in numerous communities online will make you less attached to a particular community and more able to freely seek new websites to engage assess your aggressor not sure if your experience is grave enough to be considered cyberbullying if you re being hurt by someone who continuously harasses you contacts your friends to talk about you or writes bad things about you on a web page or social networking site you may be a victim of cyberbullying a clear case of cyberbullying would be receiving five or more messages per day from the same user that includes profanities or slurs based on your race or gender the bully may be someone you also know in person in this case harassment may take the form of shaming you about your appearance social presence family or status understand your feelings the effects of being intimidated insulted or harassed online can be as startling and unsettling as experiencing your home being burgled being mugged or being constantly threatened just because the person isn t in front of you or hasn t done physical damage doesn t make your distress any less real 10 x research source kowalski robin m susan p limber and patricia w agatston cyberbullying bullying in the digital age john wiley amp sons 2012 acknowledging the emotional component of cyberbullying will better equip you to speak out and seek help cyberbullies tend to be less emotionally stable and more aggressive than their non bullying peers 11 x research source most cyberbullies do not even recognize that they have an impact on their victims 12 x research source if you re tempted to take the bullying personally remember that bullying is their maladaptive way of crying out for power and attention this is all good reason not to take the harassment personally ignore the bully choosing to ignore a bully is a difficult but effective strategy just as walking away from a bully is in person when you receive a rude or off putting message try to distract yourself from what s going on by doing something that doesn t involve your phone or computer remember that there is no shame in not responding to them you do not have to acknowledge them or try to defend yourself responding might make you feel strong and confident in the moment but it also invites the bully to continue their behavior this time with a vengeance the most efficient way to ignore the bully is to block the user through the website you can do this on most social media sites report repeat offenders on web communities these abusers are often blocked by more vigilant administrators or forum observers however if you spot these offenders or are being victimized by them directly speak out in order to help you and other users administrators are unlikely to intervene if they do not know about a problem if the bullying goes beyond a certain website i e you are being contacted via email take your case to the authorities notify the cyber bully s internet service provider isp as they will be able to block the user s access if the problem is mainly in a chat room inform whoever runs the server instant messaging services all have harassment policies that has information about what to do if there is an issue between you and another user if you receive a threat contact the police make sure you document as much contact as you can from the bully to be used as evidence learn your legal rights cyberbullying usually refers to the use of electronic communication to harass and threaten among school age youth most states have enacted legislation in response to this problem this list shows each state s laws about cyberbullying cyberstalking and cyberharassment referring to incidents between adults have also been outlawed in many states this means that it is crucial to know how the law permits you to handle cyber victimization reporting instances of cyberbullying is encouraged whether or not your state specifically references electronic communication within its normal stalking and harassment laws while cyberbullying is often committed by someone the victim knows in person laws are different if the person is located in another part of the country because cyber crimes present difficult questions of jurisdiction solutions tend to be customized on a case by case basis whether or not you can sue a cyberbully for defamation of character also varies because defining defamation is not always easy take a web hiatus spending time distracting yourself with events and activities offline can provide much needed relief from the problem increasing face to face social support is proven to buffer cybervictims from depressive symptoms much more than assertive return fire methods of dealing with bullies 13 x research source to help you get perspective try not to ruminate on the hurtful messages or posts promptly file away messages or delete hurtful messages so that you aren t tempted to look at them if the messages are actual threats remember not to delete them as they may be used as evidence in your case against the bully consider therapy cyber bullying usually involves shaming denigration and a breach of personal boundaries 14 x research source for these reasons counseling can be a great way to cope with the ongoing emotional pain and anxiety caused by long term harassment seeing a therapist is an opportunity to learn cognitive and behavioral techniques that get to the root of the damage caused by being bullied,Youth

stopped,show minimal reaction to their bullying do not show the bullies that you feel hurt and they ve succeeded in affecting you just walk away as if you didn t mind it bullies gain satisfaction from making others feel hurt or uncomfortable so reacting to them will only encourage them further 2 x research source the bully wants attention and if you show them that they are emotionally hurting you

if they see that you aren t suffering from their actions you cannot talk sense to an irrational person walk away with dignity saying you have better things to do with your time if it continues stand up for yourself whether it continues or not be sure to stand up for others who are being bullied feel your inner strength everyone has an inner strength to draw on the problem with bullying is that many bullies try to make you feel that you lack this strength and that you re less of a person because of this it s not true beware the deliberate attempt to belittle you and cause you to feel weak 3 x research source sometimes we think they can take everything we have as a person away from us believe that you are stronger than they are because deep down you are stronger than they are and stronger

bully you try your best to avoid them but don t show that you are avoiding them they will usually read this as fear or success and they will bully you more as a result 4 x research source always walk with a friend there s safety in numbers most bullies will be deterred if people in their camp aren t around they don t want to get in trouble and if your friends are around that could happen do not make jokes at your own expense to try to prove that there is nothing that the bully can do to hurt your feelings this will only please the bully and they will often chip in with their own ridicule and humiliation to lower your self esteem you re just sinking to their level with the target still being yourself there is nothing funny about bullying and agreeing with them whether it s about you or someone else is just exacerbating the problem jokes aren t appropriate in the situation even if it feels like they re diffusing the tension they re really just fueling the fire reflect an insult back to a verbal attacker if accomplished in public this can elicit laughter from surrounding peers or victims at the bully s expense this is a bully s worst nightmare as they are de throned from their position of power over you remember not to show the bully the attention they are hungry for as this will allow the bully the pleasure of actually hurting others emotionally avoid insulting the bully if they have a history of physically bullying you since this instigates a conflict you can t win instead of exacerbating the situation walk away report this to an authority figure if you believe you are in danger do not keep on doing this as this could result in the bully to beat you up also try to come up with good comebacks or as they are called roasts to de throne them even more and counter roast them when they successfully roast you outsmart the bully bullies usually aren t very smart or witty so you can use this to your advantage here are a couple of ideas laugh at everything they say and the worse the insult the harder you should laugh try to think of it as something really funny and actually laugh this is undeniably frustrating to bullies because they want you to cry not laugh scream a quote at the top of your lungs to their face you should only try this when they ve tread on your feet or in general are doing something wordlessly annoying there are many good things to quote such as the first verse of jabberwocky songs that have been mostly forgotten i am i don quixote the man of la mancha or make up some of your own i would like a dollar so i can buy a fish in this case random is the keyword the bully might be so surprised that you can cause laughter or at a minimum get away if they think you re crazy that s okay too take martial arts lessons consider karate kung fu taekwondo judo ju jitsu aikido or something similar this will boost your confidence prime your physique and enable you to gain combat or defensive skills bullies like to prey on those they perceive as being weaker than them so developing a battle aura can help deter them martial arts skills will also help you learn how not to appear to be an easy target you don t have to look like a fighter just be a no nonsense type with a don t mess with me aura it s better to be combat ready and not need it than to be black and blue wishing you could ve defended properly be smart and aware of everything study the surroundings for possible escape routes hangouts conflict zones safe zones and territorial boundaries be aware of the bully s patterns including possible connections as most bullies have a pack of underlings knowing the enemy and the surroundings could mean a lot when evading but most importantly during a direct confrontation 5 x research source be confident when walking about walk with a

person trip if the bully is grabbing you or pushing you believe it or not it s actually an advantage try really hard to keep your balance grab one of their arms with your left hand and hit their elbow with the other then using your other hand push away the remaining arm then when you get your first chance run to get to a safe place and call for help develop a deep understanding of yourself and how great you are know your strengths weaknesses and goals know what you want and what you re capable of this self assurance can be helpful when dealing with verbal bullies as their words of insult won t reach your core verbal bullies usually require an audience when dishing out insults and their words are rarely based on what s true but rather what s catchy try to overcome the rumors tell everyone it s not true and that the bully just wants attention turn the negative spotlight back on them point out their bullying tendencies and how incredibly insecure and unhappy they must be to have to pick on others these insults and the way this person is treating you has nothing to do with reality nothing to do with you and everything to do with them this is their insecurity and unhappiness showing through when they re done with you they ll likely move onto someone else don t be tempted to bully back the last thing you want to do is to sink to the bully s level while you should definitely point out why they re bullying and find holes in their argument never ever ever resort to behavior like theirs that s just another way of giving them power it makes you as bad as them and if you do you re about to get in much as trouble as they are if things do get crazy and the appropriate authorities get involved no one would know who the actual bully is you or them recognize the type of bully you

how to react when someone teases you,most of us have been teased at some point in our lives and for different reasons sometimes because someone likes us but more often because they don t if you re lucky and you haven t been teased yet you re likely to experience this annoying and degrading form of bullying someday if there is someone teasing you and you have no idea what to do there are ways to reduce it by controlling your reaction,change your perspective others can often perceive someone s potential reaction to teasing by the way they act under pressure if your perspective on teasing is the same as theirs that it makes you get angry then making fun of your quirks is what a bully is likely to do but if your perspective is indifferent towards teasing you may find that bullies don t think you re much fun and they ll leave you alone 1 x research source answer teasing with a one liner instead of engaging with the bully and teasing them back wait until they are done taunting you throw and a one liner at them before walking away 2 x research source after saying your line shrug turn on your heels and walk calmly away this displays that you aren t easily ruffled making you a boring target you can try one liners like these thanks for telling me that oh i thought i was cool so what s your point try to keep a sincere tone of voice instead of a sarcastic or angry tone as this might display your irritation and perpetuate the teasing make your voice strong using a confident tone of voice displays your refusal to back down to the teasing don t sound like you are going to cry don t sound like you are angry or upset and don t whine instead even if you re shy raise your voice so that they can hear you and make your tone even and strong a shaky voice is also an indicator that the teasing has worked to upset you get into an assertive body position looking as strong as you sound is also important you can communicate your inner confidence or look like you have inner confidence even if you don t feel it by using body language to your advantage things like gesturing when you talk and having good posture help your body take up more space making you actually feel confident 3 x research source make sure that your posture is assertive stand with your feet firmly planted on the ground your arms hanging down at your sides and your hands relaxed maintain eye contact with the bully and keep your face relaxed you might even want to smile a little since this demonstrates assertiveness 4 x research source try power posing for extra confidence standing in a powerful position can increase your sense of well being and confidence for a short period of time 5 x research source for example you can try standing like a superhero with your hands on your hips legs shoulder width apart chest out and chin up stay in this position for a minute or two react in a cool manner bullying often gets worse when you get angry in response so it is a good idea to respond in a calm cool way instead of bursting into tears or yelling out an angry response try to react as little as possible doing so will show the bully that you are not afraid of him or what he is saying to you avoid responding directly to what the bully has to say instead try saying something to show your lack of interest or concern for example you could say something like are you done talking i haven t really been paying attention or your life must be pretty lame since you are always so interested in mine 6 x research source try to avoid starting a teasing cycle it can be tempting to fight back by teasing a bully the same way they are teasing you but it is likely that such an action will backfire on you because it shows that you re irritated showing any kind of emotional reaction to teasing usually makes the teaser want to do it more let them tease you do an experiment for one week take your new attitude with you wherever you have been getting teased or keep the new attitude available if you aren t teased on a regular basis allow the people to tease you without reacting at all as much as they want if after a week they haven t moved on to teasing someone else you don t have to use this strategy anymore 7 x research source the best way to appear calm through a teasing session is to choose to believe that their teasing doesn t bother you this way if you answer a direct question or use a one liner your voice is strong and sincere instead of angry or sarcastic say to yourself it s all right if they tease me because it doesn t bother me at all choose to believe this mantra and it will show see it as a compliment you may be the target of teasing not because someone thinks little of you but because they are attracted to you and don t know how to talk to you except through negative attention even if they do have negative intentions for teasing if you see it as a compliment that you have been chosen you may be better able to resist getting angry act like you can t hear one strategy to deal with teasing is to pretend like you can t hear what they are saying in order to transform it into a joke if they get in your face and try to force you to respond just hold your hand to your ear and shake your head this can turn into a funny situation especially if you move your mouth without making a sound and perhaps pantomime being in a box or behind a wall using humor can diffuse tense situations if you show the bully how things can be funny instead of hurtful to you they might start to leave you alone 8 x research source walk away without saying anything you can try a good old fashioned cold shoulder although this action can also carry with it an emotional reaction if you walk away with poor posture this makes you look defeated or if you turn away with tears in your eyes or a flushed face the bully will know they have gotten to you try to walk away with your head held high as though the bully means nothing to you act like you meant to walk away anyway yawn instead of getting angry looking bored can also indicate indifference to being teased you can add crossed arms and tapping feet to show your impatience with the barrage looking at your wrist to indicate that you don t have time for this boredom shows that you aren t bothered and eventually a bully should move on respond with a different topic if someone approaches you with teasing behavior and you don t want to encourage it answer them with a comment or question that has nothing to do with their taunts ignoring the teasing this way shows that you aren t interested in allowing it to take place respond with a joke like what games do tornadoes like best twister 9 x research source say a comment about something else like an event or the weather tell an adult or other authority figure if none of these ignoring tactics work and the bully doesn t show signs of stopping after a few days you can tell a teacher adult or other authority figure such as a boss if it is in the workplace however your first request of this adult is for advice not resolution if you don t solve this teasing situation yourself it can get worse having someone else confront a bully on your behalf can show that it bothered you just as much as crying or getting angry in the moment understand that it s a game although every bully or teaser has a different reason for why they pick on someone the reason they all choose to tease is because they see it as a game when you react they win the game when you don t react you win losing isn t very fun which is why minimizing your reaction usually makes a bully move on 10 x research source if someone is teasing you because they like you it s still a game but not reacting won t make them stop rather it might help them to confess their feelings of attraction and be honest with you acknowledge that it s fun to them you have to understand that bullies tease because it is fun for them it is an entertainment they engage in to make themselves feel good and forget negative feelings they don t always pick on others because they don t like them or have low opinions of them once you see that it s not always as personal as it sounds this can make it easier not to let the teasing get under your skin 11 x research source ask around about your bully s background and see if there isn t something sad about their life having compassion for your bully is also a way to stop letting teasing get to you recognize that it s all about your reaction it s always important to understand that teasing is all about your reaction when you don t react the game is over and you have won bottom line the best way to react when someone teases you is to not react,Youth
how to deal with bullying neighbours,you love everything about where you live except the people next door from the nosy to the noisy nasty neighbors are a nightmare to deal with and can make you feel unsafe or unwelcome in your own home if relocating is out of the question try to resolve the issue of a bullying neighbor by calmly confronting the person seeking mediation or even taking them to court,know your rights by reading your lease or hoa rules if your community has a governing board browse their bylaws too look for rules and regulations that your neighbor has specifically broken or disobeyed if you aren t sure where to find your neighborhood or apartment complex rules contact your homeowners association hoa or landlord for a copy get familiar with local and state laws too if your neighbor is trespassing for example that s breaking the law keep a log of every incident that occurs as evidence each time your neighbor breaks a rule or bullies you write it down in a notebook or track it in an excel spreadsheet be as detailed as possible and include information like the date what happened and how it impacted you 1 x research source for example an entry might look like august 2 neighbor was blasting rock music at 2 a m i couldn t sleep as a result note any actions you took such as asking them to turn the music down even if you don t plan to go to court keeping track of your neighbor s offenses is helpful to take with you to your landlord or hoa set up a surveillance camera outside your home to record any issues train the camera on any areas where the incidences occur for example if your neighbor keeps dumping dog poop in your backyard place a camera on the back deck overlooking the entire yard save the footage on a hard drive to refer back to later on check the video surveillance laws in your state before installing a camera these vary greatly in some states like rhode island new york and california you cannot put cameras in places where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy which includes bedrooms bathrooms and anywhere people get undressed 2 x research source you don t have to install a fancy surveillance system look for affordable cameras online or at an electronics store record your neighbor with your phone s voice recorder do this if your neighbor is verbally abusing you or if you want proof that you confronted them about an issue because the laws on audio recording are stricter tell your neighbor before you begin recording that you plan to do so they need to verbally consent to being recorded say something like just to let you know i m going to record what you re saying right now if they ask you not to record them you have to respect that right and turn off the recorder ask your other neighbors if they re experiencing a similar problem are you the only one who seems to have an issue with this neighbor talk to others in the community to find out if multiple people are unhappy with the neighbor s behavior you ll have more leverage when you confront the neighbor in question use your best judgment when approaching other neighbors don t come across as the person stirring up drama or gossiping behind backs try to bring the topic up casually in conversation to feel out how the other person will react for example you could say sorry i m late jim s car was blocking our parking spot for the fourth time this week see how they respond to your comment about the car if they don t mention it move on but if they re dealing with the same problem they ll likely continue the conversation if you find you re the only dealing with the issue take a minute to make sure it really is an issue is your neighbor really being too loud or are you just tired and overstressed from a crazy week at work figure out if the problem is worth pursuing further or if it s something that s more you than them schedule a time to talk face to face if possible this isn t a conversation to have on the fly nor is it appropriate to do via text email or written letter call your neighbor on the phone and ask if there s a time you can get together for 15 to 30 minutes to chat you don t have to tell them the reason for your meeting keep it vague say something like hi i was wondering if you re free for a few minutes on thursday evening to get together suggest meeting at a neutral place like a coffee shop or neighborhood park never discuss tricky issues like these over text or email unless absolutely necessary even if your neighbor refuses to meet with you or if your schedules don t match up try your best to at least have the conversation over the phone communicate clearly what the issue is and why you re upset don t assume that your neighbor knows what they re doing wrong be as specific and honest as possible while still being respectful 3 x research source explain what happened when it happened and how it affected you be straightforward and to the point summarize your main concerns in 2 to 3 sentences don t ramble on and on and give the other person space and time to respond as well 4 x research source if your neighbor is skeptical or doesn t take you seriously show the record of incidents you ve been keeping track of as proof bring a copy of your lease or the neighborhood rules to show your neighbor so they re aware that this is more than hurt feelings or pettiness it s a real violation use i statements to avoid accusing the other person blaming your neighbor for everything that s going wrong will likely put them on the defensive try to lessen the blow and foster more positive communication by describing how their actions make you feel using a sentence that starts with i 5 x research source for example instead of saying you keep parking on our lawn and it s ruining our grass say i feel frustrated when you park on our lawn because i spend a lot of time and money taking care of it at first i statements feel unnatural practice a few phrases before you talk to your neighbor so you re prepared be assertive and maintain eye contact when talking bullies capitalize on other people s weaknesses stand up straight be confident and speak with a firm steady voice to show you aren t afraid of them 6 x research source assertive does not mean aggressive don t yell raise your voice or intimidate your neighbor 7 x research source suggest solutions that are mutually beneficial for both of you come prepared with a list of 2 to 3 ways to resolve the problem to make the conversation more productive go over each of them and provide actionable ways to implement them for example if your neighbor is constantly cursing at your kids when they re playing outside because they don t like the noise one solution could be to set up a playtime schedule actions to take would include alerting your neighbor when the kids will be outside so they can leave the area if it bothers them along with giving them your number to call if things are getting too loud instead of harassing your kids be open to compromise you aren t the only person involved in this issue so don t expect that it s going to be your way or the highway your neighbor will likely have some ideas for solutions so stay open minded and discuss those as well stay calm and composed to avoid worsening the issue a bully wants to push your buttons and cause a reaction so don t engage when they try to provoke you take a few deep breaths and keep your cool even if the other person lashes out getting worked up affects your judgment and makes you act irrationally 8 x research source notify your landlord or homeowners association of the issue in writing even if you have mentioned the problem to your landlord or hoa verbally write a letter or send an email specifically stating what is going on along with any steps that have been taken so far in an attempt to correct it not only will this let them know the details it will also serve as proof later on if you do go to court 9 x research source print out your log of incidents to include with your letter or attach it to the email some organizations or boards may have an official process for submitting complaints so check with someone in charge to find out if that s necessary ask your landlord or hoa to intervene on your behalf if you already tried to talk to your neighbor or if you don t feel comfortable doing so request that your landlord or hoa handle the issue they have more governing power and authority so they re typically more effective in resolving problems faster 10 x research source especially in apartment complexes management companies often actually prefer that you let them address bad behavior they have processes in place for residents who violate rules which may include eviction or termination of a contract this helps avoid any awkwardness that you feel confronting a neighbor multiple times after all you do have to live with them call the police to drop by if you re feeling unsafe or need immediate help threats physical violence erratic behavior or even a refusal to turn down the music at 3 a m all warrant a call to the local police station they ll come assess the situation and if need be make an arrest a police visit may scare your neighbor into stopping their bullying behavior unless it truly is an emergency like you re being attacked call the non emergency phone number instead of calling emergency services on 911 999 etc find the appropriate number on your police department s website consult a lawyer to determine what your options are before you even think about going to court find out if you even have enough of a legal case find a local lawyer who specializes in neighborly disputes and schedule an appointment to talk through the problem they ll be able to help guide you in the legal process and determine the best course of action to take come to your meeting prepared with your log of incidents your lease or homeowners association contract and any other important documents that could help build your case understand that litigation is a time consuming and costly process make sure you re ready to commit a lot of hours and money to it before you jump in try mediation first to resolve the issue outside of court in mediation you ll sit down with a third party mediator who will lead a conversation about the issue you ll each get to share your point of view and then the mediator will talk you through different solutions and their pros and cons once you agree on a solution the mediator will document it in writing so you both have a record of it 11 x research source having an unbiased mediator referee the discussion helps decrease hostility between the two of you these mediators are specifically trained in conflict resolution mediation is much cheaper than litigation a lot of states and local governments even offer free mediation services 12 x research source because mediation is voluntary your neighbor would have to agree to attend the session out of their own will your homeowners association or apartment management company can usually provide you with phone numbers for mediation services request a protection order if your safety is threatened a protection order also known as a restraining order can only be filed if your neighbor is arrested and there is a pending criminal case file the necessary paperwork with the court then attend a hearing where the judge will determine the parameters of the restraining order 13 x research source protection orders are issued if you re being stalked or harassed or if your neighbor is threatening you with physical violence in many cases you won t have to pay a fee to file your request for a protection order check with your local court to find out if you qualify for a fee waiver 14 x research source file a lawsuit invoking the law of nuisance in small claims court this is one of the most common lawsuits for neighborly disputes when your neighbor acts in a way best described as being a nuisance 15 x research source file a complaint with your local court then attend the hearing scheduled for your case at the hearing you ll receive an injunction which is an order from the judge on how to correct the issue for example if your problem is a neighbor who stands outside your house to smoke everyday the injunction may be that they must be 50 feet 15 2 m away from your house to smoke you may also sue the landlord or your hoa if they were aware of the issue but did nothing to correct it you re paying the lawyer to navigate this process for you so rely on their best judgment and legal knowledge to make sure you go through the right channels for filing collect damages for any harm that was caused damages are a sum of money you re awarded if you win a lawsuit if the judge orders damages to be paid your neighbor will be responsible for paying you that money damages can be compensatory or punitive 16 x research source compensatory damages pay the person who was injured for example if you missed work because of your neighbor s bullying behavior compensatory damages could include payment equivalent to your wages for those missed days punitive damages are designed to punish the person who was wrong in this case that s your neighbor if punitive damages are awarded the judge will request that your neighbor pay you a determined amount of money,Youth

how to tell someone to leave you alone,if you want to know how to tell someone to leave you alone then you must be dealing with a lot of pain and frustration though it s never easy or pleasant to tell someone to leave you in peace whether you re dealing with a bully a classmate or a person who has a crush on you the sooner you break the news the sooner you ll be able to get back to your life the most important thing is to remain calm and to be as direct as possible if a conversation doesn t work then you may need some additional help from your friends teachers or parents,find the right time and place to tell the person if you want to tell someone who means well to leave you alone then it s important to find a nice quiet place to do it whether the person is someone who has a crush on you or just an annoying classmate if you feel comfortable around the person then you should try to tell him or her in a quiet place where you can be alone without the threat of someone coming in and asking what s happening you should also find a time when the person you want to talk to isn t distracted busy or stressed out so the conversation goes as well as it can though it s important to find a good place and time if you care about the person you re talking to you also shouldn t wait around forever for the perfect time to come along it s important to get the message across so you can both move on with your lives if you feel more comfortable having a friend there for support then that s fine too don t put yourself in an uncomfortable situation if you d rather not be alone with the person explain why you want to be left alone once you get the person alone it s important to be open and honest about the fact that you want to be left alone if the person has a crush on you and you don t return those feelings then say so if the person is your neighbor or classmate who always wants to hang out and you re just not interested then get the point across say it loud and clear so there can be no mistake that you just don t want to see the person 1 x research source for example if the person is a girl who has a crush on you you can say i m sorry that i don t return your feelings i m flattered but i d like to be on my own if the person is an annoying person who keeps trying to hang out with you just say i m sorry but i m just not interested in spending time with you i thought you should know if the person has actually done things to annoy you or make your life difficult or if you ve already given him or her a few chances then you can say this to get the message across if you re nervous about what to say here then practice in advance remain calm it s natural to be a little bit or very upset when you have this kind of conversation however if you want to get the message across then the best thing you can do is try to remain calm and keep your wits about you if you feel yourself getting emotional take a deep breath and give yourself some time to return to your senses if you keep your cool then the person will see that he can t mess with you and that he should take you seriously you want to look like you have it together if need to take deep breaths or even need to excuse yourself for a minute to get the message across then don t be afraid to do so if the other person gets mad and says things to taunt you or make you upset don t let it get to you don t stoop to that person s level and fight back and take the high road instead don t make excuses though you may think it s better to make excuses to soften the blow if you say things like now is not a good time for me or i m just not ready to date but i really like you then you ll just be giving the person false hope instead of doing this telling the person that you re honestly not interested will make it much more likely that the person will get the message and will leave you alone and what s more you won t be hurting the person s feelings as much 2 x research source of course it ll be easier to make an excuse in the moment than to be direct but if you do that then you won t be getting the message across and the person will come right back to you if someone is just plain mean to you you can say so say i don t want to hang out with you anymore because you always end up making fun of me i really don t appreciate it and would like to be left alone be honest but not hurtful if the person is genuinely nice then you shouldn t try to hurt his or her feelings more than you need to it can be tricky to find a balance between getting your point across and being sensitive but you should work to make it clear you don t want to spend time with the person without name calling or being insulting you want to be better than that besides you want to end the relationship whatever it may be not fuel the fire and lead the person to keep bothering you for even longer 3 x research source if a girl likes you and you don t return her feelings you can be honest about the fact that you don t feel the same way without explaining that she s just not your type and that you like girls who are taller or saying that you think she s annoying if the person is a younger sibling while you can t get him or her to leave you alone forever you can say something like i d really like some privacy while i hang out with my friends you re getting in the way right now let the person talk if you respect the person and he or she has something to say then you should give him and her the chance to talk as long as the person is emotionally stable and just genuinely likes you a lot he or she may want you to listen for a little while if you want to be nice then give the person this allowance taking the time to really pay attention though you shouldn t make this last more than a few minutes if you care about the person even a little bit then can take this time to listen don t interrupt or offer your own opinions wait for the person to say what he or she has to say respond as kindly as you can and get ready to end the conversation make sure the person understands what you re asking before you end the conversation it s important to ask the person if he s clear on the fact that you are to be left alone you want to make sure that your words had a lasting effect and that your message was received loud and clear you can even see if the person will repeat that he ll leave you alone so he sees that you re serious and that you weren t just having the conversation for fun before you leave the conversation you should make sure that the person understanding in no uncertain terms that you are to be left alone thank the person for talking to you if the conversation has gone reasonably well then try to end it on a good note thank the person for hearing you out and understanding that you want to be left alone this conversation was likely pretty difficult for both of you and you should try to wrap it up positively given the context of course it can t be too positive if you re asking to be left alone but you can try to be as nice as possible though you may not feel like saying thank you it s only polite and it may lead you to have a better understanding with the other person get backup if you need it if the person has really been bothering you and you don t want to be alone with him or her then you should get a few friends an older sibling or even a parent or teacher to go with you when you ask to be left alone if you re genuinely afraid for your own well being then you should make sure not to be left alone with the person when you have this difficult conversation so you can feel safe and confident 4 x research source if the person is a bully then having your friends there with you can make a big impact on your confidence though you may try to settle it yourself first if that hasn t worked having your friends around can make a difference your friends or siblings should be there for support but you should do as much of the talking as you can to show that you can stick up for yourself tell the person that you want to be left alone immediately if you really need to be firm then you shouldn t make small talk but should come right out and say it just say leave me alone or please leave me alone from now on though this won t be pleasant the sooner you get the message across the better if this is someone whom you really need to be firm with then you shouldn t waste time on small talk 5 x research source look the person right in the eye and show that you re not afraid if you look down at the ground then you ll look intimidated speak slowly and clearly make sure your words are heard loud and clear be direct make sure you re saying these words in no uncertain terms don t say go away not now or i m busy but make it clear that you want to be left alone at all times for good though it won t feel great to say these words it ll be far better than being wishy washy and making the person think you d be up to seeing him or her again if you re struggling with being direct have the friends with you help get the message across 6 x research source it should take more than a minute to say what you have to say just a few clear sentences on wanting to be left alone will do the trick if the person is a bully or just not worth your time then there s no need to explain why you want to be left alone that should be obvious don t listen to excuses the person may have some excuses for why he doesn t want to leave you alone or how he thought he was just helping you out or thought that you really liked him deep down if you re serious about wanting to be left alone then you should make it clear that you won t take these excuses and aren t open to having a debate or a conversation you ve made your point and want to move on if the person is a bully who keeps insulting you just walk away there s no reason to listen to that promise that there will be consequences if the person doesn t listen if the person really doesn t seem like s he is getting it then you can start bringing on the consequences say that you ll talk to your parents the person s parents your teachers your school administrators or even the police if the person really doesn t listen to you it s important that the person knows that this can t drag on any longer and that you mean business 7 x research source the more specific you are the better if you can name specific teachers or administrators you will tell then that will scare the person off much more effectively if you plan on telling your parents you can say that you can pick up the phone and call your dad at work right now make the person see that you ve put a lot of thought into him leaving you alone and he will be scared off talk to your parents if the person really won t go away then you should talk to your parents about it let them know that you re feeling threatened or just really really annoyed by the person who won t leave you alone you may be a little embarrassed telling your parents about it if the person really has a crush on you but they can help you get rid of the annoying person and deal with the situation they can make you feel safer and can even take further action to limit your contact with the person 8 x research source your parents will know what to do and you ll be safe in their hands they ll appreciate the fact that you went to them with your problem and will feel responsible for you you shouldn t look for the perfect time to tell them just make sure they re not busy or about to run off to work and sit them down and have the conversation and if it really can t wait then tell them what s up get help from your friends your friends can also be a big help in this situation not only can they be around you more when you think the person who won t leave you alone will be there but they can also help tell the person to leave you alone and will discourage him or her from following you around 9 x research source your true friends will be there for you through thick and thin and will understand that you re in a tricky situation they ll make sure to spend more time with you and will see to it that you re never alone if you re feeling unsafe if your friends are always with you then the person will lose interest whether he has a crush on you or wants to taunt you your friends can also help you see what the best course of action is if the person you want to be rid of is a real bully then they ll tell you that you need to get more help than they can provide avoid gossiping about the person if you gossip about the person or keep talking about how he won t leave you alone then it ll get back to him not only will this make him angry or even more persistent but he may even have the idea that you really do like him or want him to come around if you didn t then why would you keep talking him if you really want to make it seem like you want to be left alone then you should just drop the subject as much as you can you can confide in your close friends about what s happening and ask for their advice but you should avoid telling just about anyone who comes your way about the situation or the person will hear all about it talk to a teacher or school administrator if the person is really persistent and follows you around or keeps pestering you everywhere you go then it may be time to get your teachers or your administrators involved tell them that the situation has gotten out of control and see what punitive measures they can take to keep you safe from the other person having an adult involved can sometimes change the person s mind and will help him take your threats seriously 10 x research source don t be nervous about it especially if you re dealing with a bully you should talk to these authority figures as soon as possible so measures can be taken if the person is a bully then he ll threaten you and will say that you ll be in trouble if you tell your teachers or administrators however these are empty threats it s much better to tell people what s going on and to stay safe change your routine as much as you can to avoid that person if you ve tried everything and have even gotten parents and administrators involved then you can work on changing your routine to avoid the person for a little while though you shouldn t have to change your life too much to suit the other person if you re reaching your last resort then you can work on avoiding places where the person is likely to be this can mean hanging out in a new part of the park going to a different movie theatre or discovering a new restaurant with your friends as the person loses interest you can go back to your old life 11 x research source you don t have to change absolutely everything you do but if walking to school a new way leads you to avoid the person who is bothering you then it may be worth it ignore the person and hope he or she gets the message though ignoring a person isn t the most mature way to get him or her to leave you alone if you ve tried having a conversation telling other people and even avoiding him or her then this may be something you have to try if that person walks by and says something mean to you or smiles at you act like he or she doesn t exist if that person somehow makes it into a group conversation you re having casually walk away if you end up in the same coffee shop get out of there without causing a scene though this may not feel great it can help to get the message across if the person sees that his words or presence don t affect you or make you upset and that you couldn t really care about what he or she says then he ll lose interest and if you leave every time he or she shows up then that will grow old too which is exactly what you want stay safe if you re dealing with a person who won t leave you alone and that person is threatening to you then the most important thing is that you stay safe the person may be more than annoying and may even be emotionally unstable and you should make sure that you feel safe and protected at all times while you shouldn t stay at home all day for fear of running into the person you should make sure that you ve taken measures to protect yourself from this person even if this means contacting the authorities it s not worth it to risk your safety just for your pride if you genuinely feel like you re in danger you should absolutely say something as soon as you can,Youth

seems imminent body language is your best weapon crouch down slightly and put one leg a few inches behind the other for better balance if you appear serious in defending yourself the bully will think twice about fighting or physically harassing you 10 x research source look the bully in the face focus on how the bully moves and adjust your position confidently you are essentially committing yourself to fighting so be prepared to defend yourself don t lie about your prowess if you exaggerate how strong fast or tough you are most bullies will take it as an invitation to fight stand your ground face the bully and let them make the first move say something like i don t want to fight you but if you hit me i m going to defend myself if you boast about your strength or make overly aggressive advances the bully may begin to target you more frequently and continue the cycle of violence 11 x research source protect yourself from a physical attack put your hands up by your face

not as big a target defend yourself from a physical attack if fighting is imminent with a bully act and fight like you ve got nothing to lose do this only to prevent future bullying not for revenge a few fast and hard punches to the stomach or the face should be plenty to stop a bully sometimes all you have to do is knock a bully down to the ground 12 x research source be sure to do it in a public place with witnesses even if you get embarrassed or beat up in the end you ll have proof you need for the bully to eventually get punished in most cases it s best to tell your parents you were

from the haters just remember that it s impossible to please everyone and try not to let unjustified hostility get you down,ignore them if possible don t even bother to engage with your haters bullies

react and the hater reacts to your reaction 1 x research source bullies are a special type of hater for someone to be a bully their actions must be repetitive and there must be some type of power imbalance involved 2 x trustworthy source stopbullying gov website run by the u s department of health and human services providing information related to identifying and preventing bullying go to source while all bullies are haters not all haters are bullies for example your little brother can call you names without being a bully since you re probably bigger and stronger than he is likewise if a classmate says one nasty thing to you then she isn t a bully in general passive methods are better when dealing with bullies while confrontation may be best to address other kinds of haters if your hater is annoying you in class pretend you can t hear him or her if your hater provokes you or tries to get your attention do not respond in any way remember that ignoring hate is not best in all circumstances if the person who hates you starts to physically or verbally assault you it is best to get other people especially an authority figure like a teacher or work supervisor involved project confidence self confidence is your best weapon against a hater laugh off insults drop witty comebacks and stay positive if you don t let your confidence slip a hater is more likely to get frustrated simply start leaving you alone 3 x research source for example if someone insults your art take the high road try saying i m sorry you feel that way but art is subjective i m just doing my best to improve though so i would appreciate any constructive criticism you may have if someone calls you weird you could say maybe a little but i like who i am what s wrong with being weird when you are walking by someone who hates you don t look down or lean the other way that kind of posture tells the hater that you re afraid that you re giving the hater what he or she wants instead stand up tall with your head held high avoid the haters this does not mean that you should hide from anyone you should never let bullies rule your life simply try to put yourself into situations that don t require you to interact with these haters when you re young you will especially get a lot of hate from people who don t understand your interests and passions instead of hanging around these sorts of people look for ways to pursue these passions outside the scope of their negativity if you are dealing with especially malicious haters in one of your classes ask if you can transfer to a different one if you are facing haters in a club or group consider whether you can find another group that is not so negative if you know that a particularly nasty person is always in the same spot every day do not go to that spot find a way around or ask a group of your peers to go past the spot with you avoiding the haters is also a great way to boost your self confidence this gives you an opportunity to pursue your interests without the flood of negative thoughts prove them wrong if your haters are saying that you can t do something the best way to shut them up might be to show them up do the thing that they say you can t do and do it well use their hate to fuel your drive for example if your haters tell you you ll never be good at sports you can prove them wrong by working hard join a team in a sport of your choice if you don t already belong to one and throw yourself into practice if haters think you are too scared to talk to your crush let that motivate you into finally asking him or her out be aware that proving haters wrong does not always make them stop in some cases your success could make the haters even more jealous this is not a reason to keep yourself from succeeding but don t do anything just to show them up live life for yourself speak up if you can t take it anymore don t avoiding haters doesn t always resolve the problem find a moment to speak honestly with these people and try to explain where you re coming from speak with each hater as a mature and conscientious equal no matter how rudely the other person has been in the past this is especially important for passive haters who may not insult you directly try telling your hater i ve been getting a lot of negative energy from you recently and i d appreciate it if you kept those thoughts to yourself it s childish and i don t want to have to deal with this anymore try to understand why your hater is acting this way ask him or her have i done something to personally wrong you you seem to be taking a lot of negativity out on me and i don t understand why don t be rash haters feed on your emotions if you respond quickly and emotionally there s a good chance that you won t be able to make a strong point if you lash out you will only give them more reason to make fun of you do not let your words be clouded by anger and frustration give yourself the time to cool down before you respond avoid physical violence resolve conflict with measured words and confident maturity if hatred is fire be like water and extinguish it be cool and collected fighting fire with fire doesn t work while you should never start a fight don t let a hater hurt you learn self defense and protect yourself turn your attacker s strength against him or her don t respond to trolls haters you run into online can sometimes be

differently try reaching out to critics with personalized comments be empathetic logical and polite offer solutions try not to respond out of anger with poorly thought out words 6 x research source

not be a part of your life in five years think about why perhaps you re going away to college or you re switching to a different job or you re shifting your social circle is there any way you can make this transition happen sooner forgive the haters understand that hatred reflects back upon the one who spreads it these people are likely not hating on you because of any wrongness or deficiency on

look happy to be where you are and avoid hunching over or looking at the ground look engaged and happy when you talk to other people and walk to class with a purpose not like you re dragging your feet though developing true confidence can take a long time making the effort can put you on the path to being less likely to be bullied 1 x research source look at yourself in the mirror check out your body language and make sure that it s open and positive while dressing to the nines may not help you feel confident taking time with your appearance and showing that you care about how you look will make bullies less likely to bother you maintaining good hygiene will make you feel better about yourself which will in turn raise your confidence gather support from your friends if you have a group of friends or even just a friend or two this is the time to get their support you can tell them about what s happening and make sure to stick by them in any threatening situations if you know when the bully is most likely to approach you whether it s in the halls or on your walk home then make sure you re not alone but walking with at least one friend so the bully is less likely to approach you and if you have an older friend or even an older sibling you can walk with that will also scare the bully off unfortunately bullies love to prey on people who don t have many friends if this is you then know that you re not alone and try to work on developing friendships with people or at least getting to know a few acquaintances just having someone to sit with in the cafeteria or to walk with in the halls will make you less likely to get picked on learn to stand up for yourself if a bully comes up to you and says hurtful things then your best bet is to exude confidence stand tall and to look that person firmly in the eye and say stop or leave me alone just saying something simple and then moving on can show that you re not letting the bully get you down and that you re willing to stick up for yourself this may make the bully think that you re not a good target because you re too strong of course you have to get a good read on the situation if you feel like you re in a dangerous or threatening situation then your best bet may really be to back off and get away from the bully as quickly as possible if the bully keeps annoying you and saying stop and standing proud isn t working out you can try to outright ignore the bully if you just walk by like you don t see him or her acting like his or her words are having no effect on you then the bully will be likely to get bored or to disengage pretty quickly he or she won t see the point in bullying you if it s not getting a reaction out of you stop living in fear if you go about your day thinking about all of the ways that you can be bullied from being tripped in the cafeteria to being laughed at in class then you are going to spending your waking life being afraid of everything that can happen of course it s best to be on your guard and to be prepared for anything when you re being bothered by a bully but you should try visualizing a positive outcome when you think about any of the negative situations that can arise in a bully s presence if you visualize positive results after confrontations with bullies then you are more likely to achieve what you want consider taking some self defense classes while you shouldn t start fighting a bully who comes up to you and only resort to violence if you have no other option taking a few self defense classes such as karate can help you not only learn to defend yourself but to gain the confidence you ll need to stand up to bullies just knowing that you could fight back when a bully is approaching you will make you much more confident when you face the bully and you ll also have more confidence in your own strength if self defense classes aren t up your alley you can also consider signing up for an after school sport any sport can help you get into shape and you may even make a few friends along the way believe in yourself if you know who you are and have faith in yourself then you will be less likely to be approached by a bully you don t have to think you re the greatest person in the world but always putting yourself first and knowing that your goals and needs are important can go a long way in helping you avoid bullies if you think you are an interesting thoughtful and worthy person then a bully will be much less likely to bring you down bullies don t like a challenge they prey on the weak if they see you and think hey there s a guy who is pretty happy with himself then they won t want to make the effort to try to make you feel bad but if they think there s a guy who is already miserable in his own body then they ll be more likely to make a move avoid the bully as much as you can this may sound like an obvious point but one of the ways you can prevent being bullied is to simply avoid places where the bully is likely to be sit in a new spot of the cafeteria take a new path to class or a new path home do what you can to be away from that person as much as possible though you shouldn t change your whole life and schedule just to avoid this person avoiding the bully will make him or her get bored and to stop making the effort to bother you this is a good short term strategy though in the long run you ll have to take stronger measures to prevent the bullying don t stoop down to the bully s level if the bully is mean to you calls you names or tries to humiliate you in public of course it will be tempting to be mean to that person back but if you really want to stop the bullying then you can t stoop down to the bully s level if you call him or her names back try to fight unprovoked or just engage in general meanness then you ll be escalating the situation and making it worse for yourself 2 x research source there s nothing more frustrating for a bully than a person who doesn t respond call him names or show that he cares at all if you add fuel to the fire then you re just giving the bully exactly what he wants don t let the bully see that you care a bully s goal is to make you cry and to feel worthless sure the things he says may be hurtful and may fill you with self doubt but you must never ever let the bully see that anything he says has an effect on you if he says something mean and you look visibly upset then he ll only be encouraged to dole out more of the same but if he calls you names and you shrug and act like you couldn t care less then he will be much less likely to keep pestering you 3 x research source of course it can be hard to keep your emotions bottled up inside especially if the bully is really hurting you just try to stay calm breathe count to ten or do whatever you can to not let the words hurt you if you need to cry try to do it in privacy and to at least maintain your cool while you re in the bully s presence though it may sound hard try not to let the bully s words get to you or make you think there s something wrong with you remember that the bully is a mean person who takes pleasure out of hurting people why would you think that anything he she said was true tell an adult or authority figure many people are afraid to tell adults teachers or other authority figures about bullying because they think it makes them look like a wimp and that it can make the bully more angry if you really want to prevent bullying though then you can t be afraid to take these more drastic measures when they are necessary if the bullying has gotten out of control or even if you ve had just one really horrible experience with a bully it s never too soon to tell your parents your teachers or someone else at your school or in your community the adult will have an idea of how to handle the situation if the bullying is really out of hand then you may even have to contact local law authorities and the adult can be a big help in navigating the situation don t ever blame yourself don t ever think that it s your fault that you re being bullied because there s something wrong with you bullies are often cruel and irrational people who have low self esteem and who try to make themselves feel better by belittling other people they don t act rationally and it s never your fault if a bully starts bothering you don t be hard on yourself and think that the situation could have been avoided if you looked or dressed differently if you re being bullied then it s important to be calm to think positively and to avoid blaming yourself if you want to get out of the situation as soon as possible 4 x research source if you re down on yourself about being bullied then this will make the bully even more likely to target you instead you should think and act like you don t deserve to be treated this way don t respond if a cyberbully is sending nasty comments to you going around impersonating you or just generally trying to upset you online it can be easy to want to fight back and to tell that person to go away and to start calling that person a few names yourself but the truth of the matter is the more you engage with the bully the more they will think that they re getting to you and the more likely they ll be to keep bothering you 5 x research source you can say something like please leave me alone but other than that don t talk to the person you can tell the person i m saving evidence of this conversation to encourage the person to stop bothering you beyond this though it s best to avoid talking to the bully at all just as in real life if the bully sees that he or she has the power to make you upset he or she will be more likely to continue bothering you block the bully whether you re on facebook chat g chat or another form of instant messaging block the bully from your account so you cannot receive any messages from them you may also appear invisible to the bully depending on which programs you are using once you block the bully from talking to you he or she is likely to give up on trying to reach out to you blocking sends a louder message than engaging with the bully the bully will see that you re serious about wanting to be left alone save the evidence if the bully sends you hurtful chats posts or emails don t delete the evidence save it in case you decide to contact your service provider or to talk to an adult or an administrator of your school having a written record of the bully s behavior will give you the proof you need to get the bully in trouble save it somewhere print it out and make sure the evidence is on hand when you need it if you don t save any evidence then it ll be your word against the bully s and the bully is likely to deny having any online contact with you even the act of saving and storing the evidence of the bullying will be empowering for you even if you decide not to use it create more private settings if you want to make it less likely that you ll be bullied in the first place you can also create higher privacy settings whether you re using your facebook twitter or another online account limiting the access that people have to your photos and the things you post can help you avoid people who are just trolling your profile in order to find something to laugh at or be mean about that said you should also be careful about whom you accept as a friend on online networks if you accept absolutely everyone who wants to be your facebook friend without knowing very much about that person then it s more likely that this person will end up making some unpleasant remarks think about what you post of course it is never your fault if you are being bullied or cyberbullied still you can think about which comments you post and who is able to view them if you post something very controversial or likely to offend a lot of people then you may be opening yourself up to having people bully you about what you re saying though most bullying does not happen because of posted comments if you want to be more safe than sorry then you should avoid posting anything that is likely to anger a lot of people 6 x trustworthy source stopbullying gov website run by the u s department

confidently your bullies will not get the reaction they desire 2 x research source stay calm if you are being mocked try to stay calm with the wave of embarrassment and hurt feelings washing over you this is probably easier said than done however in the moment staying cool takes away the power of those trying to hurt you their goal is to hurt you and see you sad not reacting denies them the

you 6 x research source slap your knee and really exaggerate how funny you think their comments are say something like that s a new one or that s the funniest thing i ve heard all day say something like that s enough or quit being rude think about something else in the moment it can be difficult to focus on anything other than the mockery that is being directed towards you however mentally leaving the situation may help you better deal with it try thinking of a place that is peaceful and makes you feel happy this will help you stay calm and not let the attacks hurt you 7 x research source you can also imagine a brick wall between you and those mocking you that is deflecting their comments give a witty comeback a sick burn is a great way to turn the tables on those mocking you

you 8 x research source say something like wow did you come up with that all by yourself or pardon me but you seem to think that i care try the yes and technique if someone is giving you a hard time about something just respond by acknowledging their teasing and then inserting a joke for example if someone zings your new haircut by saying nice haircut joining a punk band you can reply with yeah and tomorrow i m piercing lips nose and mouth 9 x research source roll with the teasing although it might seem counterintuitive sometimes the best way to deflect mocking is to acknowledge it

mocked about wearing a hat they consider weird you can respond by saying yeah it looks weird but you have to admit that it s pretty cool act like it did not happen blowing off those making fun of you takes away much of their power over you this demonstrates that you are above their comments and that they have not impact on you this not only takes you out of the immediate situation but also undermines the bullies ability to further ridicule you 11 x research source try to walk away confidently and calmly this will convey to the people mocking you that their words have not hurt you understand that those mocking you are unhappy it is important to remember that those who are making fun of you are doing so because they are unhappy and they want to make you feel the same way

how to get someone to leave you alone,getting unwanted and excessive attention can be very uncomfortable or even scary it can be difficult to tell the person that you are not interested in reciprocating contact especially if he is a former friend co worker or past romantic partner the way to handle unwanted attention will vary depending on what the pursuer s intentions are such as whether he wants friendship or romantic involvement and how intensely you are being pursued here are some guidelines for how to get someone to leave you alone,be honest let him know that you are not interested say this assertively but without being mean you do not need to list all of his faults and hurt his feelings just be clear that you don t think a relationship of whatever sort is at stake will work and that you would prefer it if he leave you alone 1 x research source for example if he keeps trying to get you to go on a date and you want him to stop you might say look i m sorry but i am not interested in dating you can you please stop asking if the honest reasons may actually hurt the individual such as if you find him annoying re phrase the reason to make it less hurtful for example if he asks why you will not date him instead of saying something along the lines of i find you annoying you could say our personalities clash and i do not think we get along that well this removes the emphasis from his character and places it on the particular dynamic that occurs between the two of you encourage his empathy empathy leads people to act more prosocially let him know that the way he is behaving towards you is making you uncomfortable or scared and that the experience is unsettling he may not realize that his attention toward you is making you feel uncomfortable he may reach the opposite conclusion that you like his affection and attention engage his emotions by telling him how you really feel about his unwanted behavior 2 x research source for example if he still is still pursuing you even though you have said your personalities do not match you might say i have told you that i am not interested a number of times and i feel like you aren t listening which is making me feel uncomfortable and nervous don t leave any doors open do not give him any wiggle room to misinterpret your words if you do so he may stick around or give you distance only temporarily rather than saying i m not interested in dating you right now close the door entirely by saying i am not interested in dating you 3 x research source threaten legal action in severe cases of unwanted attention after all other options have failed and you truly feel unsafe threaten legal action be ready to turn him over to the police if he continues let him know that you are taking detailed notes about his actions toward you keep a record of all of the communications attempts he makes say no with your body language this step will only work if he can see you during your communications having closed off body language or looking like you are in a rush may allow him to realize that his communication attempt with you is unwanted when he approaches you again try looking away slouching fidgeting or yawning to signal that you are not interested 4 x research source be careful not to accidentally signal interest with body language such as leaning in or laughing 5 x research source shorten your communications sometimes telling someone you are not interested is not enough or there may not have been an opportunity to pull him aside and break the news keeping any communications short and to the point will help him get the hint that you are not interested it will also make it more difficult for him to continue communicating as there will be less to discuss 6 x research source for example if he texts you and asks you how you your day is going and whether you want to go for dinner you might ignore answering the question about your day and just say thanks for the offer but no thanks stop your communications if he has not yet gotten the hint and speaking with him directly has not helped it is time to stop all communication do not give into feelings of guilt about backing off from the situation if you believe that removing this individual from your life is a good idea then keep that in mind if you start to feel guilty guilt motivates us to repair relationships but sometimes it tries to motivate us when it is actually not in our best long term interest to do so 7 x research source 8 x research source if after you say no to his date requests he tries to make you feel guilty by saying things such as i m going through a hard time right now so you saying no really stings keep in mind that guilt can misfire and lead you to make poor decisions just because you are stopping your communications does not mean you should delete the communications he sends you particularly if you feel that you are or may be stalked by this individual in which case it is a good idea to have a record of all communications should you need them for legal purposes ditch him in severe cases such as if you feel you are being stalked changing your email address phone number or in the most severe cases your home address and or work location will greatly influence your chances of getting any unwanted individual to leave you alone get social support tell your family and friends about your situation they may be able to give you helpful advice on how to deal with your situation if the person you are telling knows the individual who is giving you unwanted attention be sure to remind whoever you are confiding in to be discreet and to not share the information beyond who you say is ok to tell find a resource appropriate for the situation think about the severity of the situation you are in and whether it is time to seek outside help in the united states there are laws against stalking police involvement and other legal interventions are options in severe cases there are also hotlines to help deal with stalking such as http www stalkinghelpline org consult the resource you have decided to use do not hesitate to make use of the resource you have found particularly if you feel threatened if this is a work related matter check with your human resources department about what resources are available for situations involving unwanted attention from a co worker if this is a school related matter check in with your teacher or principal to find out how they can help you navigate the situation you are in if you feel that you are being stalked consider getting the police involved inform the individual that you have sought outside support only follow this step in certain contexts however in some cases it may be better to be discreet such as if the situation is not too severe or it is at the workplace in other cases such as if you feel like you are in danger letting him know that you have the police or other social resource involved may lead him to back down,Youth

positive affirmation such as i welcome positive uplifting relationships into my life or i try my best to be a great sibling perform self care being the victim of bullying is stressful the constant

change the relationship and distance yourself from the sibling removing your sibling from your life is a drastic step ensure you have thought through your decision and that this is what you really

and aggressive 2 x trustworthy source stopbullying gov website run by the u s department of health and human services providing information related to identifying and preventing bullying go to source many bullies shove or push their victim if you are being bullied the bully may inflict minor or major physical injuries on you in places that they know not very many people will see or notice they may do this to avoid suspicion from a parent or a supervisor notice if the person invades your personal space bullies can also inflict physical discomfort in more subtle ways such as invading your personal space on a continual and relentless basis if you work in a cubicle or an office for example the bully may come in and sit right on your desk or stand in front of your cubicle or office door if you are trying to work in the library at school the bully may come and sit right on your school books or pull up a chair very close to you invading personal space is often done by bullies who are trying to intimidate you or scare you without using actual physical assault bullies may also invade your personal space and then escalate their bullying tactics to physical attacks consider ways they can cause pain without hitting you making loud noises pointing bright lights at your eyes and shoving stinky things in your face can be bullying if the person is doing it with the intent to cause you pain or ignoring your requests to stop it they don t have to hit you in order to hurt you causing sensory pain this may be tailored to a disability such as flashing lights at a photosensitive person or making loud noise in order to watch an autistic person jump and whimper trying to irritate an injury such as prodding a broken arm or dropping things for you to pick up when you have a painful knee injury trying to trigger a medical condition such as using flash photography to try to trigger a seizure in an epileptic person or showing graphic content to someone who has ptsd or a phobia check if you are physically uncomfortable in the presence of the person often your body will respond to bullying in psychosomatic ways which is a physical illness that occurs due to mental trauma or stress this could be an overwhelming feeling of nausea anxiety or stress when you are in the presence of the bully or more physical symptoms like throwing up a rapid heartbeat headaches and panic attacks 3 x research source you may experience physical discomfort in the presence of the bully or during times when you are not around the bully the night before school for example you may feel physically ill at the thought of having to see the bully or you may become nauseated and sick on your drive to work because you know you will need to see the bully in the office these are all psychosomatic responses to bullying and often will only go away if you deal with the bully notice if the person screams yells or shouts at you verbal attacks in the form of screaming yelling or shouting can also be considered bullying the bully may yell insults at you or mock you loudly in the presence of others they may also taunt and yell at you when you are alone with them often verbal abuse can be as damaging as physical abuse as you can be mentally and emotionally hurt by the bully s words verbal abuse can often go undetected if it is done quietly and constantly so it is important to notice if the bully is causing you psychological pain through hurtful words discern the difference between constructive and destructive criticism constructive criticism is well meaning specific and designed to help you improve you come away knowing exactly how to do better while it can hurt if done too bluntly it isn t bullying destructive criticism contains no useful advice and is often personally insulting an example of specific and helpful criticism is this article could use some work it s a stub at this point and could benefit from an expansion regarding how to ask the guy out an example of destructive criticism is this article is useless unhelpful and just plain stupid clearly the writer has no idea what they are talking about occasionally people give ill meaning advice that appears constructive but is meant to shut you up instead of help you this advice may make little sense and they may flood you with nonsensical critiques intended to frustrate you or erase your agency instead of help you note if the person speaks ill of you to others bullies also tend to defame you to others by spreading mean spirited lies or rumors about you or by making fun of you to others they may speak ill of you a professional level such as spreading lies that you continually miss deadlines or that you cheat on every test they may also speak badly of you on a personal level by attacking your character through lies about your relationships with friends partners and family you may hear about the bully s lies through your friends or coworkers and feel a sense of shame or guilt remember that you are not responsible for the bully s actions and you are not to blame for the bully s bad behavior consider if they criticize you based on gender or minority status a bully may draw on existing power dynamics such as discrimination against muslims to attack you this can make you feel isolated and unsafe especially when they have the power of general discrimination on their side minority status can include race religion disability including disability symptoms lgbtqia status gender presentation size ethnicity and more or they may try to insult you by comparing you to a stigmatized group such as saying that you look girly or that you sound like you re disabled even if you are not a member of that group pay attention to how the person treats you in a group or in front of others the bully may act in a

group and humiliate you 4 x research source consider how you feel about the situation maybe you feel that power dynamics are at play and you re scared to talk to them or they can stop you from doing things you care about conversations with them may end with you feeling powerless frustrated or unable to express how you feel and what you want you might find your mind wandering back to them again and again wondering how to deal with them or why they treat you this way try explaining your feelings using i language to the other person a good person cares about how you feel for example if you feel hurt when they joke about your accent they will stop making those jokes as soon as they find out they are clueless and not a bully a bully will tell you that your feelings are unimportant or nonsensical anything to justify not listening to you recognize when the person seems to set you up to fail often bullies in the workplace tend to try to exercise their power over you in overt ways one way they may try to exercise power over you is to place an unreasonable amount of workload on you so you are set up to fail they may also continually pressure you over your missed deadlines or upset clients as a way to make you feel small and helpless 5 x research source the bully may also do this in a school setting where they get you in trouble with your teacher and causes you to suffer academic setbacks or penalties they are likely doing this as a way to limit your progress or to prevent you from succeeding ask your coworkers or friends if they believe you are being bullied

to ensure there is always a coworker or a friend in the room with you when you are near the bully so they can observe the bully s behavior towards you they may then be able to deduce if you are in fact being bullied talk to a teacher or a supervisor if you feel you are being bullied it is important that you not keep the bullying a secret or hide it from people who can help you you may be afraid to come forward and report the bully due to fear of backlash from the bully or rejection from your peers or you may feel socially isolated from everyone around you and feel no one cares about your well being but reporting the bully will be the first step to getting the bully to stop hurting you and can help you to recover from the trauma caused by the bullying 6 x trustworthy source

essay or work of fiction many goals have delayed rewards which means that you might not associate them with the positive feelings you receive later on reward yourself immediately by having some chocolate seeing a movie or hanging out with friends work hard on areas of challenge sometimes it s best to focus on improving your weaknesses rather than on making gains in areas where you re already competent if someone has identified something you could legitimately improve on take this seriously and work to become better than you were before for example if you work in retail and you re amazing at customer service but you don t feel entirely confident at the register devote time to learning the ins and outs involved at the register recognize and refute negative self talk 6 x research source

someone else sometimes we may not even be aware that we are holding these views 7 x research source examine the truth of these messages for example if someone told you that you re naturally not good at math try to look for objective information that may indicate whether or not this is true were you bad at math before people started telling you what you re capable of do you really think you re incapable or does the belief influence how you act toward math counter the lie if someone told you that you re bad at math but you think that may not actually be true go out and prove her wrong take an extracurricular math class so you can study up and become a math wiz alternatively work some math lessons online or hire a private tutor avoid letting these kinds of messages you received earlier

clear answer vague goals are associated with a lack of commitment 9 x research source for example if someone is underestimating you on your math skills set specific goals for how to improve such as solve 10 math problems from your textbook a day this will provide a more explicit actionable and concrete way to remain committed when someone is underestimating you rather than something vague such as be good at math understand what being underestimated and criticized can do to you being underestimated and criticized can cause us to feel badly about ourselves the resulting sadness can close us off from seeing available options ultimately causing our performance to suffer keep this in mind when you are reacting to being underestimated if you feel like you can t handle what someone is saying and it s getting you down respond appropriately such as refusing to engage with her it may seem like you should be able to control how you feel about what she says to you but it s not always that easy 10 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source ask yourself why someone would underestimate you an easy way to defuse someone s criticism of you is to understand her underlying motivation for doing so sometimes people believe that others can t do something in order to protect their own lack of self confidence if she doesn t think she can do it then it might make sense for her to think that you can t do it either be on the look out for the kind of people who belittle others because of their own feelings of inadequacy avoid taking it personally when you come across them and get a taste of their insecurity go easy on yourself if you have trouble not taking it personally have some self compassion perhaps you haven t had enough people believe in you in the past did you have a critical parent or friend who would knock you down and tell you that you couldn t achieve your goals it s

abilities the fact is intelligent people do silly unintelligent things all the time but unintelligent people rarely do really intelligent things that is to say that making a mistake is not that diagnostic of your abilities also don t make mountains out of molehills and watch for other people doing it to you as well you may even want to say to her for example you ve only seen me perform this task once or twice i don t think you can really give a fair assessment right now don t expect perfection for yourself if people criticize your abilities it can be good to take this as a challenge and work toward bettering yourself but also keep in mind that no one is perfect there will naturally be areas in which you excel and areas that present a greater challenge to you this doesn t mean you shouldn t try to improve but at some point it can be helpful to accept where you re at rather than strive 24 7 try to find a balance between working on improving your abilities and accepting yourself

responses you can throw out to the teaser to get him off your back practice not responding to the teaser learn to control your anger so that you don t give him any ammunition ask the person teasing you to stop standing up for yourself is a good way to get people to stop teasing you if you assert yourself and give consequences for teasing many teasers will back off it s much easier to tease a target who doesn t defend himself than it is one who decides to stand his ground this may not work in all situations but asserting yourself is a good first step to deal with someone who is teasing you for example you can say you can t tease me like that leave me alone or i ll do whatever it takes to defend myself train in a martial art taking classes in kickboxing or jiujitsu are good ways to learn how to defend yourself you shouldn t pick fights and they will teach you in these classes to only use violence as a last resort but even training in a martial art will make you more confident 4 x

if not ask what you could do to change that would a hair cut make you feel more confident new clothes standing up straighter you can also work on things like practicing your strong voice you don t need to yell just practice putting a lot of power behind what you say you ve probably heard people use this firm tone before such as parents or teachers try to speak from your stomach rather than your throat walk away sometimes the easiest way to handle being teased is to get away from the person teasing you since teasing is usually not as physical or mean as bullying it shouldn t be too hard to walk away 6 x research source here are some things you can say to the teasing person while you leave i don t have time for this i ve got better things to do i don t have to put up with this find someone else to tease avoid the person another strategy is to avoid the teaser in the first place learn his schedule of classes or how routine in order to figure out what you should do to avoid crossing his path for example s he may sit at a certain table at lunch or s he might take a particular route home find out where s he goes and plan different routes you can enlist help from friends who may have seen him her around tune them out ignoring someone who teases you can take the ball out of his court if you come across your teaser look straight ahead and pretend not to hear anything he says if you have an mp3 player and earbuds listen to music so that you don t have to hear her him avoid seeming frightened and never looking in his her direction which can make you seem like an easy target but don t give him her the time of day either 7 x research source distance yourself emotionally pretend he she is talking to someone else if she he is not your friend then he doesn t really know you anyway so he she might as well be practice putting a protective shield around yourself by realizing that his her words don t have to affect you they re just words and he she is not an important person in your life it can help to understand why people who tease other people do what they do if the teaser is more of a bully he she has probably had a difficult life he she may attribute hostility to the people around him and have a lot of paranoia understanding that he she is a hurt fragile human being can help you put the behavior into context 8 x research source change the topic you may be able to distract and redirect your teaser by changing the topic of discussion think of this as a magic trick to fool people who try to tease you if you don t give the person teasing you anything to work with he won t be able to keep going in a way he she needs your involvement in order to tease you here are some techniques you can use pretend like you didn t hear the teasing comment and continue on with whatever you were saying before forcibly change the topic if someone is teasing you act like you don t care and start talking about something else such as homework or what you re going to do when you get home this will take the steam out of his her sails ask a friend to back you up having a friend with you is a strong deterrent for people who tease and bully others it s a lot harder to deal with two people than one person if you re worried about being teased on the way home from school or in between classes plan it out so that you ll be with a friend at these times say to your friend hey will you walk with me to class so teaser s name won t mess with me seek help from a teacher or principal if the teasing is bad enlist help from a teacher or principal at your school it s their job to protect you you don t need to feel like you re telling on the teaser he she is the one at fault and all you re doing is taking care of yourself and others most likely since he probably teases multiple people there are things that teachers and principals can do to stop the teasing and make you feel safe don t be afraid to involve them you can tell her him this guy gal is teasing me and i need help can i talk to you about it get your parents to intervene if your teacher isn t doing anything about the teasing or if it s out of her control talk to your parents they can talk to

how to handle an insult,let s face it no matter who you are at some point you will feel insulted by the remarks of others you do not have control over what people say to you but you can control how you react learn how to read situations to determine how you should respond to insults and be sure to treat yourself kindly in the process,determine the person s motive 1 x research source question the other person s reasoning for the remark was the comment even intended to be an insult or was it a tongue in cheek statement meant to be taken lightly the context can often help you determine whether an insulting statement is mean spirited or simply blunt figuring out motive will help guide your response if you are hanging out with friends or family consider how you all usually communicate do you often gently tease on another as a form of affection was the comment stated in the middle of a heated discussion or during light hearted conversation if you are in a social event with strangers or casual acquaintances consider the tone of what the person said he or she may have been nervous to approach you and used a frivolous remark to start a conversation not knowing that the remark could be taken offensively if you are in a work environment consider whether this form of communication is second nature some employment environments are ripe with constant ribbing does this person often say similar things to others if this occurred with a romantic partner consider the surrounding context of the conversation were you arguing and your partner threw out an insult or did they merely make a comment about your behavior characteristics in a reasonably neutral context resist the temptation to snap back impulsively reacting to a perceived insult means you re putting your emotions in the driver s seat returning the insult also undermines figuring out the motive of the remark the person could have been teasing you in a light hearted way and you make the situation worse what s more when you snap back after an insult you give the person insulting you power you might also end up making this person look like a victim to everyone else determine if there was some truth to the statement in some cases we feel insulted by others comments because there is some truth to their words if you feel a slight sting because of someone s remark rather than taking it personally strive to use the comment as constructive criticism if the subject is something that you genuinely want to get better at then pull the person aside and ask him or her for suggestions to improve if the person is not someone who you would like to enlist for help turn to someone else you can count on for timely advice on improving in this area use humor 2 x research source 3 x research source humor serves three fundamental purposes after an insulting remark it thwarts a mean spirited insult it lessens any animosity and puts a potential audience in your corner let s say you re hosting a house party and your

in my room and upset my pet snake ignore the slight 4 x research source if you re not much of a joker or you tend to come up with witty comments hours later you can always choose to let the remark slide honestly choosing to ignore an insult whether light hearted or mean spirited gives you a lot of power it s like saying to the person i don t find that comment worthy of my reaction note that you would only ignore an insult if you thought it to be minor crude and offensive remarks should not be tolerated so if a person repetitively does this you need to speak up strive to accept the insult as the other person s opinion other people have opinions if everyone loved the same things and hated the same things the world would not be as interesting if an insulting remark was made as a result of a difference in opinion try not to take it personally 5 x research source now respecting others opinions does not mean you should not be true to your own it simply means recognizing that others look at the work through an entirely different lens than you do an example for reframing the comment and acknowledging it as the other person s opinion would be to immediately think of ways other people have described you to the contrary perhaps your coworker called you lazy but your partner always praises your ability to take initiative and put in extra effort having a contradictory example confirms the statement as that person s opinion rather than a fact respond if you choose to address the insult ask the person immediately or sometime after if you could speak with him in private pulling him aside demonstrates some consideration as opposed to calling him out in public calmly tell the person that you find his comments to be insulting and that you would like them to stop right away if appropriate explain to the person that you will go to someone in authority if the comments do not stop 6 x research source one possible response could be i m sure you didn t mean this but i really felt hurt by

opportunity to stop if he or she chose not to the consequences rest in this person s hands not yours breathe insults can easily make you feel like the spotlight s on you or that you are being attacked strive to effectively cope with being insulted by taking a moment to collect yourself first doing this ensures that you do not insult the person back which could tarnish your reputation it also allows you time to really think about the insult and determine the underlying motive behind it deep breathing can be very effective when you are feeling anxious or stressed to perform deep diaphragmatic

consider why they are acting out and know that it may have little to do with you the best bet in this case is to refuse to engage with these kinds of students refrain from giving them any sort of reaction when other students seem to treat everyone around them in a mean manner it can be a sign these students have underlying issues they are trying to hide they are probably not acting mean to just you but instead trying to hide their need to fit in with a mean attitude that pushes everyone else away they may feel like the safest approach at school is to scare everyone off so no one can hurt them 6 x research source if the bullies are acting out for attention there s a good chance that they will leave you alone if you don t react define the hateful behavior there are a variety of behaviors that can hurt your feelings but each one requires a different course of action is there an actual action being made against you like being called names or is it more of the feeling of being left out of things take a look at their actions to see if they are being done to make an effort to harm you or if you are just interpreting a lack of effort on their part to include you to be mean 7 x research source decide if the behavior could be labeled as bullying in order for it to be considered bullying there must be an imbalance of power intent to harm and repetition bullying is a serious offense so be sure the behavior happening to you meets the criteria before you get your classmates in trouble while at times any mean behavior at school may be labeled as being bullying not all behaviors actually add up to this for example if a classmate who is in the same grade level about the same physical size and has no real power over you is bothering you this probably isn t bullying since there is equal power the intimidation factor isn t present beyond the power issue there also needs to be a valid intent to harm so if this is a classmate who just plays jokes on you but doesn t seem to want to harm you that isn t bullying a classmate pulling one practical joke also lacks the repeated pattern of bullying as well talk to someone you trust explain to this person how your classmates are treating you ask for their advice be careful to keep your conversation fact based tell this adult what the classmates did how often it happens and what the outcome was let the friend consider why this is happening and give you advice as to how to handle the situation 8 x research source speaking to someone who is close enough to the situation to even witness what goes on may help

work with groups of students you may have more in common with or assisting you in becoming a bigger part of the class take notice of the people who are kind to you is the problem with just one class if you are having a problem with one of your classes but not others it means that some people are able to value your presence and treat your politely focus on the classes you have friends in and know you are liked one approach to fixing a class you are not enjoying is trying to network with even one person from that class outside of the classroom if you are a quiet student is there another quiet

trustworthy source stopbullying gov website run by the u s department of health and human services providing information related to identifying and preventing bullying go to source it is one of the most notable challenges facing young people today and as a consequence has finally become an issue of serious discussion among teachers parents and community members if you have a bullying problem or

to do so they don t find people who are supposed to be in charge to help it is their responsibility to stop bullying and they should use it if the first adult you talk to is not helpful try another bullying has become such a serious issue of discussion in recent years that it has become hard to ignore in the past adults often dismissed it by suggested that young people always must solve the problem on their own or simply told victims of bullying to ignore the bullies increased sensitivity to the issue has made those statements seem out of place both the national institute of health a federal agency and the american academy of pediatrics have websites devoted to anti bullying initiatives and these are just some indications of the growing awareness of bullying s significance 2 x research source 3 x research source some adults may not have gotten the message but increasing numbers understand that bullying simply cannot be tolerated any longer talk to your parents it is unfortunate that some adults won t listen but if those in the area won t listen to you then they should at least listen to your parents school officials and others who work with young people sometimes do not adequately respect the young people they supervise but they usually cannot reject the input of parents the ones who give them authority by placing young people in their care if they still refuse to deal with the situation then at least your parents can begin thinking of ways to get you out of that environment but they can t begin this process unless you talk to them be confident bullies often target those who appear vulnerable or cautious if necessary fake confidence you may just discover after a while that you really are sure of yourself after all 4 x research source don t avert your eyes when a bully looks at you stay calm acknowledge that they are there and move on to what you really want to do if you look frightened or seem to expect trouble from them then they may

this is not easy but it is necessary bullies seek victims and you are less likely to be targeted if you refuse to treated as one develop a wider circle of friends bullies often target isolated individuals if you have many friends they are less likely to focus on you there are two primary reasons for this first if the bully likes to physically threaten you associating with others makes it appear that others are on your side additionally for those bullies who prefer to insult others their statements will be meaningless to those who actually know and appreciate you 5 x research source

of the playground bully while traditional bullying was often intended to make the bully seem powerful to others cyberbullying is often anonymous while the person spreading rumors or attempting to humiliate others online may feel powerful their goal is more often to do damage to someone s reputation they are also do not necessarily limit the audience to people who personally know either the

them on certain sites certain legal options may be available to you and your family web content can provide irrefutable evidence of harassment or threats as a result of new state and federal laws threats of violence posted online can even result in lengthy jail sentences if this seems like a bit of an extreme solution just keep in mind that you are not without options and do have some power to change the situation confront the bully while this is part of the standard program for dealing with traditional bullying it may also be the quickest way to put an end to it make it clear that you are not intimidated by the cyberbully you will ignore their posts and eliminate any of their hurtful comments that you can get away from the bully this is another tactic that was recommended for use

how to ignore haters,most people know the phrase haters gonna hate we have all had moments when other people haters bullies or critics tried to cut us down deter us or exclude us often they did this maliciously and their aim was to bully or control us no one should stand for this sort of treatment however sometimes people criticize in order to help us there s a big difference between a hater who criticizes destructively and someone who gives you useful constructive criticism know how to react to and deal with abuse how to tell bad from good criticism and how to accept constructive criticism doing so will help you to grow as a person,turn the other cheek bullies and haters do what they do in order to exert power they want to know that they have the ability to control you including your emotions and reactions don t give them that satisfaction ignore them as an effective counter 1 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source ways to ignore a bully include walking away acting as if you aren t listening to them or telling them that you re not interested in what they are saying for example you have options if a bully tells you that your school project was terrible you can walk away you might also tell him directly your opinion doesn t really matter to me ignoring a bully doesn t necessarily mean acting as if the abuse isn t taking place what it means is that you refuse to react how they want you to react deflate the bully deflating can be a bit like ignoring in both cases you are denying the bully the satisfaction of having power over you and your emotions the difference is that you are engaging their behavior but in a way that derails it 2 x research source saying something as simple as why would you say that turns an insult back on the bully without seeming aggressive you might also try being dismissive of the bully saying really whatever or even pretend not to hear all can help to deflate the bully s behavior the key to deflation is to confront the hater without retaliation you poke a hole in their attempt to control you if they see that you aren t vulnerable to their abuse they may move on remove the hater s audience bullies and haters need audiences they do not abuse others for the sheer fun of it but in order to establish a place in a social pecking order to raise themselves at your expense in the eyes of others if you take away their audience they lose their purpose and power 3 x research source this technique is not always easy and might be outside of your control however you can sometimes work against a bully try deflating them in front of others for example say that you walk into the lunch room and your hater starts to tear down your performance in the school play in front of a group saying geez it s only a play hey alex i heard that you scored tickets to the big game great both deflates the bully and deflects the conversation you have taken away his audience tell someone growing up a lot of us heard that we shouldn t be tattletales this advice isn t very good when it comes to bullying and may even be harmful be willing to talk to someone if you are experiencing out of control bullying or abuse especially if it is physical talk to a trusted adult a teacher a family member it is in your interest to report threats and assaults if you don t the bully may become more aggressive your safety should come first standing up to abuse is your choice but don t take unneeded risks with an aggressive hater or bully tell someone if you feel threatened or in danger 4 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source note the intent sometimes we get feedback we don t want to hear whether from a classmate a teacher a coach or a parent criticism isn t always hating it s meant to be constructive there s a big difference bullies abuse hate and tear down that is destructive criticism constructive criticism on the other hand is meant to help us 5 x research source intent is the big difference between these two kinds of criticism why is a person criticizing you if they are trying to hurt you to be cruel or to just tear you down it s destructive if a person gives criticism that points out your mistakes or faults but also how you can improve it is constructive it still might hurt but it is worth listening to say that your hockey teammate tells you you re a terrible skater or you really suck out there these are examples of destructive criticism hating it would be constructive if your teammate had said you re a weak skater try bending more at the knees and getting lower to the ice you ll get more power in your stride note the target of criticism not only intent but the target of criticism is important in determining whether it is destructive or constructive destructive remarks target the individual you they are meant to attack you as a person constructive criticism does not do this it focuses instead on your work your skills a concept a process or something else it is impersonal examples of destructive criticism include you re stupid what s wrong with you you re doing this all wrong note that the criticism attacks you and your personal worth examples of constructive criticism include your writing sounds kind of stilted try to use simpler sentences or you nearly hit that car always check your blind spot before changing lanes it can be hard to separate yourself from your work or other things that you love try not to take it personally someone who criticizes your writing for example is not attacking who you are as a person they may just want to help you improve note tone of criticism how criticism is delivered is also important destructive and constructive criticism can both be harsh and difficult to hear tone is a key separator however a destructive critic usually takes a hurtful tone maybe contempt maybe mockery or maybe just insults constructive critics may point out faults but their tone is supposed to be cruel 6 x research source for example a hater would say something along the lines of only an idiot would do it this way the tone is very personal insulting and hurtful a constructive critic might take the same fault but express it more kindly this is wrong but it s a common mistake what you could have done differently is note that the tone is more impersonal and leads to a piece of advice note the lack of substance of advice at heart the advice is what most separates destructive from constructive criticism the first aims only to tear down without offering suggestions for the future the second on the other hand is meant to offer advice and to help you improve a hater will never or rarely have suggestions for how you can improve e g that was pathetic or why did you waste your time on that constructive criticism offers useful advice for example say you get a low grade on a paper and the comment it seems like you wrote this essay very fast it is filled with errors always make sure to proofread this criticism may be blunt but it offers genuine advice be open to constructive criticism lots of people talk about haters when they get a piece of criticism while there are lots of critics out there we sometimes fall back on the word hater as a way to avoid confronting our own failures in other words we dismiss criticism when we lack the self awareness to critique and improve 7 x research source criticism can be hard to hear however we sometimes need to hear the truth in order to grow don t resist all criticism learn to tell constructive criticism from destructive criticism be open to criticism when it s mean to help you listen once you ve recognized constructive criticism learn how to grow from it the first step is to hear the person out you may need to practice this as your first reaction is often to become defensive listen to them before you do anything 8 x research source try to remain objective or outside yourself when getting constructive feedback remind yourself they aren t attacking me this isn t about me personally try active listening techniques during the conversation like paraphrasing if you are getting written feedback read and re read the comments to make sure that you understand ask questions be careful not to misinterpret criticism if you have the chance follow up with questions and ask for clarification on points that you do not understand asking questions will help you to better grasp what is being said internalize the criticism and find a solution for example can you please clarify what you meant when you said that my thesis statement was fuzzy don t lash out it is easy to get defensive when faced with criticism tell yourself over and again that constructive criticism is not personal resist the feeling and try to be open whether it is a peer a boss a teacher or a loved one remind yourself that they are after all probably just trying to help 9 x research source take a deep breath if you feel overwhelmed or angry think is it the criticism that bothers you or the way in which the criticism was delivered if the criticism is constructive overlook the delivery decide whether it is accurate resist the urge to dismiss criticism out of hand take some time to think it over is it accurate is it fair try to be as neutral as you can you may risk missing an important truth if you ignore criticism consider asking a friend mentor or family member about criticism make sure that it is someone whom you trust but who will give you the truth for example sam my teacher said she thinks i m working below my ability i trust you and want to know your opinion take steps to address the problem if you ve faced constructive criticism listened and assessed it and decided that it is accurate the next step is to make a change at this stage you can probably see clearly what the problem is and have gotten beyond your frustration or anger implement a plan to address the problem self reflection is a sign of maturity responding to criticism will not only help you but also shows others that you are willing to face up to your weaknesses address them and improve,Youth

how to deal with girls calling you a slut,girls can be cruel to one another girl on girl bullying often begins in elementary school and in some cases lasts into the adult years one way mean girls sometimes put another girl down is by spreading rumors or using language that implies that their target is sexually promiscuous this is a classic put down that relies on the idea that there are certain things good girls don t do like have sex with a lot of guys in some cases though you might be called a slut or something similar even if you ve never had sex the phrase itself often is meant to imply that you are a bad girl and should not be trusted while it can be a hard situation to deal with there are several strategies you can try if you find yourself the target of this type of bullying,understand the difference between friendly teasing and slut shaming the word slut is a sexual slur used almost exclusively against women it s a way to say that a girl or woman is a bad person because she has too much sex or too many sexual partners 1 x research source sometimes it is used in a bantering way between friends and other times it is used to bully or put a woman down sometimes girls and women call each other sluts as a way to take back that word from its negative use in an effort to make light of it and drain it of some of its power it s a way for girls to take the shame out of enjoying their sexuality there are many oppressed groups that have reclaimed words once used against them in this way if you have friends who call you a slut think about their intent they may mean it in an endearing way you can ask them to stop if it bothers you and since they are your friends they should understand and do their best to stop if someone is using the word slut against you in a way that makes you feel belittled hurt or harassed it doesn t matter what her intention is she is bullying you know that the word might not have anything to do with sex although the term slut is usually associated with someone who has a lot of sex or who expresses her sexuality in ways that other people don t approve of in reality it is often used in other ways by girls themselves one study of college women found that the word had very little to do with the target s sexual behaviors instead in the study higher social class women used the term against lower social class women as a way of saying that they didn t want to include them in their social group 2 x research source that study found that white middle to upper class college women used the word slut against poorer women and women of color most often and that the bullies themselves often had more sexual experience than the targets 3 x research source recognize that you are being bullied this might seem silly especially if you re not a little kid and you think bullying belongs in elementary school actually people of all ages can experience bullying which really just means that a person is mean to another person over and over again 4 x research source calling names like slut is a very common form of girl on girl bullying they may be calling you a slut because gossip has spread about your relationships or sexuality possibly started by someone who wants to increase his own reputation as a stud but this word and others like it such as whore hoe or skank may simply be your bullies way of humiliating you with little or nothing to do with your sexual behavior take safety measures on social media technology makes bullying easier than ever so if you are active on social networking sites you may need to take some precautions to keep bullies from having access to your information lock down your privacy settings and ensure that your only friends on social media are people you know and trust in real life if you

wouldn t want circulated among your family friends workplace or school report any bullying or threatening messages you receive to your parents teachers and even the police if the messages happen frequently or contain any threats learn healthy ways of dealing with conflict you might be tempted to return like for like when it comes to bullying behavior but fighting with your bully by calling her names spreading rumors about her or getting into physical fights will not help your situation in fact it might result in you getting into trouble when she s the one who started the whole thing if you have one bully consider approaching her and asking her to stop be the bigger person this can be incredibly hard in the moment but give your bully a sincere smile and say something like i m not sure why you said that but i really want you to stop then walk away sometimes a bully can be so taken back by a genuine response that she won t know what to do 5 x research source if you think your bully is an otherwise reasonable person ask her if she wants to talk you might say is there something i did that made you angry at me would you like to have lunch and talk about it sitting down and

want to sit down and talk knowing that you re a reasonable person who is open to discussion might make her less upset with you and less likely to target you think about the relationship as a balloon that is not fully filled with air if you don t put any air into the balloon it will continue to not have substance to it if you do put air into the balloon it will get bigger and bigger engaging a bully is a lot like this if you refuse to feed into the bullying dynamic you refuse to put air into the balloon eventually the bully will pick on someone else in order to inflate her balloon use

girls at once all by yourself 6 x research source avoid the situation as much as possible try to avoid running into your bullies if possible and ask a friend to go with you if you have to go somewhere you know the clique will be 7 x research source don t react remember what your parents told you as a child about how reacting to a bully is just giving them what they want it turns out your parents were right bullies thrive on power so if you don t respond by getting angry or crying you ll drain the experience of fun for the bullies and they will hopefully move on try to stay calm and focus on something else if it happens again 8 x research source talk to someone if you are feeling targeted by girls at school or women at work you don t have to suffer in silence talking about it can help you

the person responsible for the gossip if you know who started the rumor if you feel like you need to set the record straight this can be a good option however if the person who started the rumor is a bully who does not care about you you should know that confronting that person might make you even more of a target take responsibility for your lifestyle if you re happy with your lifestyle what

target herself she may be trying to fit in she may be bullied at home or it could be that the bully lacks a way to regulate her own anger and expresses it in unproductive ways understand why bullies target girls and women s sexuality it is not a coincidence that the word slut is used against girls and women in a derogatory way in fact women have been targeted this way for a major portion of recorded history at least since the victorian era western society has focused on what some scholars call the madonna whore distinction this is the idea that women are all either good pure innocent

and still affects how we view and treat women today 14 x research source know that it isn t just about sex while terms that focus on women s sexuality like slut ho or whore are often used to degrade women there s usually a deeper more sinister meaning that doesn t have much to do with sex when someone is called one of these things it s a way of saying that they are not a good girl or woman they don t fit society s mold in some major way the term is a way of showing complete rejection for that person you can fight back against this treatment of women by never using gender specific insults not even in jest you know yourself the best don t let anyone label you or stop you from doing what you like if you enjoy sexual relations and if that makes you happy please go ahead if anyone who judges you based on what you re doing speaks volumes about them not you,Youth
how to respond when a bully jokes and teases you,it can make you feel bad to have someone at school call you names or make jokes at your expense the most important thing to recognize about bullies is that your response can determine how the person treats you in the future learn some savvy ways to put a bully in his place and reduce teasing these include ignoring the offense confronting the bully and going to a person in authority when teasing gets out of hand,ignore the teasing act as if you didn t hear the person at all keep doing whatever you were doing teasing is only fun for the other person if you react if you were talking to friends keep doing that if you were reading quietly continue doing so don t allow the bully to disrupt your activity at all 1 x research source practice anticipating what the joke may be so that it does not catch you off guard let s say you know a certain person always teases you about your hairstyle or voice prepare yourself by running her usual taunts through your head at the same time tell yourself she is wrong and inaccurate then when you hear them from a bully you are less likely to be as affected by them teasing usually goes for something very obvious and can even be something you have no control over like your name something physical about you like being short or a host of other personal traits the bully can t tease you if things like your name rhyming in a funny way or being short is something you already accept maintain a calm facial expression the bully may be hoping for a big reaction don t give him the satisfaction it may be difficult but try not to change your facial expression from what it was before the bully said something 2 x research source avoid rolling your eyes or even fake smiling as this could signal

time to participate in this foolish behavior use humor respond with a cool one liner such as a question or light hearted joke if the person teasing you is looking for a laugh take back the power and

teasing you wants laughing at yourself also takes away the power of the joke 4 x research source getting a funny response or being asked a question is something the person who is teasing you will not expect she will probably not have a comeback and this ends the teasing say something cool like do you seriously find yourself so funny that the same lame joke makes you laugh day after day i m

how to be nice to a bully,bullying can be a problem in any community in a school in the workplace even online often times the behavior of the bully is a reflection of their own insecurities and is not due to any flaw of your own though this unkindness can be overwhelming and harmful through a conscious effort you can overcome nearly any bully and even find ways to demonstrate kindness to them,never counterattack the bully is looking to control you by forcing you to react to their meanness giving in means that they have won don t allow a bully to affect you so much that you become a bully yourself take a moment to step back from the situation emotionally count to ten in your head if you need to in order to calm down and prevent reacting negatively be positive when they are negative

say something unkind if they find that their bullying is unsuccessful in making you feel bad they will likely retreat 1 x research source for instance if the bully says something negative to you about

thank them this will throw them off as well 2 x research source distance yourself from the bully sometimes removing yourself from the possibility of an interaction with a bully can help try taking a different route increasing your privacy online or making sure you re not alone with the bully stick up for yourself politely just because you want to be nice to a bully doesn t mean you have to be a pushover a bully is more likely to show kindness to someone they respect and if you allow yourself to be treated unkindly with no pushback the bullying will likely progress redirect the focus away from the insult and onto the attacker without bullying back with a brief response such as why do you say that 3 x research source prepare and practice your responses come up with some responses and practice saying them in the mirror when you are home 4 x research source do some role playing of the kinds of situations that might come up practicing makes you more comfortable when you need to do it

words such as please stop that it s my turn please don t touch it s not okay to do that 7 x research source document the bullying write down everything record what happened when where how and who was there enter it in your journal or diary print out material from online bullying this is important if you want to have a logical conversation with the bully or be able to demonstrate to an authority figure what has been happening 8 x research source take a different perspective rather than thinking of them as a bully and you as a victim think instead on their action in an isolated way think to yourself this is one action out of one million that they will take today rather than allowing that one act to define who they are and how you think of them instead of thinking of the person as a bully consider their actions as an act of bullying just as you are not the sum of all of the worst things that you have done or said your bully is not either do your best to separate the person from the bad things that they do reflect on what you know about the bully understanding the bully will allow you to respond more appropriately to their actions consider the information that you have about the bully like their age educational background family home and job more often than not a bully comes from a family or a home where they are also being bullied and they respond by releasing their pent up hurt and anger on others remember that hurt people hurt people your bully is probably dealing with emotional issues that they do not know how to handle this can be the first step in you developing empathy for them you do not need to invest a lot of time in finding out this information sometimes the information we already have is telling enough don t judge the bully when someone is rude and unkind it can be easy to judge them for their faults instead focus on not critiquing them for these inadequacies but instead practicing empathy and compassion in dealing with them 9 x research source consider the ways you too may have been rude or hateful to others in the past not as a way to excuse the bully for their actions but as a way to relate to them show your bully the kindness you want them to show to you respond nicely and with compassion even when they are rude to you 10 x research source the bully may be very unaccustomed to people being nice to them so show them the kindness missing in their life if the bully always does something like closing the door in your face open the door for them these small acts of kindness add up and teach the bully how to treat you and others greet your bully with a smile and a hello each day that you see them they will marvel at your continued positivity and joy consider your similarities there are few people on this earth who are singularly evil or unkind ponder the things that you and the bully may have in common to allow you to further develop compassion for them this will make it easier for you to be kind perhaps you and your bully both share a love for baseball or for a certain type of food when they are rude think on these similarities to help you be kind in return put yourself in their shoes true kindness and empathy often stem from being able to understand a person s perspective if you know that your bully has faced bullying in their life also this could explain their negative actions towards you your bully may also be dealing with a difficult personal situation that is causing them to lash out at you this does not make their actions okay by any means but it can help to inform your responses to them invite the bully into activities and conversations including the bully can help to build relationships and relating skills ask them to help you with something or pick them to be on your team 11 x research source keep working towards changing the bully relationship into an appropriate and productive relationship this can take time but to stop bullying we all need to work together to encourage

by asking your bully if they re okay or want to talk help the bully if you see them struggling you may see your bully struggling to lift a heavy box or having difficulty carrying a lot of items help them they will likely remember all the times that they treated you unfairly and begin to feel remorse remain calm bullies are often looking for an emotional response so it helps if you avoid bringing emotion into your response you can protect your feelings from hurtful insults by ignoring the unkindness or by using positive self talk 13 x research source breathe deeply deep breathing can help you

friends to recenter yourself back to positivity practice positive self talk often times a bully is hurling so much negativity towards you that it can be difficult to think positively about yourself it is important that you don t let yourself get trapped by the message of the bully and that instead you develop positive messages about yourself if a bully is constantly telling you that you are ugly try looking in the mirror at yourself every morning and night and repeating something like i am beautiful i am strong i am worthy to yourself repeatedly until you begin to acknowledge that it is true remember that the message of the bully is an opinion how you feel about yourself is most important meditate in the mornings and at night before work or school meditate on principles of positivity and thankfulness these messages will give you strength as you start your day find a supportive community though the bully may count for one of your interactions in your daily life make sure that they are not the only surround yourself with positive and affirming people who will lift you up so much that the bullying will begin to affect you less and less seek community at church with your current friends with family and with others that you trust you never know if someone you speak to has been bullied before and may be able to give you advice on how to handle it with grace respect and kindness practice self care being kind to others is intertwined with showing kindness to yourself take time to yourself when you are alone to do things that you enjoy like reading watching films or exercising these things can often get the bullying off of your mind and help transport you back to a place of joy and positivity despite the bully s actions remember that you can t help others unless you are good to yourself first talk to someone you trust you may find that the bully can overwhelm you if you feel that you are becoming depressed seek out help from your family and friends you may find it

how to cope with hurtful insults,sadly everyone occasionally encounters being verbally insulted by others sometimes people make insults as a joke sometimes people aren t even aware that their words were hurtful however there are times when people say cruel and spiteful things to intentionally cause you emotional pain if you ve been hurt by someone s insults there are a number of things that you can do to help you cope,speak to the person privately oftentimes it is beneficial to privately address the individual who has insulted you speaking privately is best to avoid the situation from escalating in front of others and to lessen the insulting person s likeliness of becoming embarrassed or defensive before speaking with the individual take a deep breath and calmly ask the person to speak with you privately once alone let the person know that you did not appreciate his insult and inform him of your expectations and what action you ll take it happens again for example you might tell a coworker i felt hurt and insulted when you called me stupid i want you to speak to me in the same respectful manner as i speak to you i ve asked you not to call me names before if it happens again i m going to file a formal complaint to hr about your harassment sometimes saying less is better you can address the insult by briefly addressing the problem 1 x research source for example you could say that statement was completely uncalled for i won t stand for you talking to me in that manner if it happens again i will no longer invite you to family gatherings inquire about the intent behind the insult an effective strategy for responding to an insult is to inquire about what is actually at the heart of the insult do this by asking the individual what has led her to make a comment that could be potentially hurtful 2 x research source like a counselor you are getting the individual to personally reflect on the root causes of her actions which forces the person to accept personal responsibility for her words and actions be sure to focus on the actual intent behind the insult and not the actual words that were said 3 x research source for example you might say can you help me understand what is going here what happened to cause you to want to hurt me by insulting me like that you could also take a guess at the underlying feeling of insult for example i understand that we don t agree on this topic and that upsets you however i d prefer that you stick to the topic rather than resorting to personal insults set boundaries it s critical that you establish communication boundaries when dealing with people who resort to personal insults sometimes it requires directly stating what topics of conversation the person is allowed to engage you in in addition you might also might need to set boundaries for when the person should speak with you 4 x research source if you are dealing with a coworker who tends to launch insults you could tell him sean i am asking you very kindly to please not bring up my personal life during our staff meetings in fact i would prefer that we engage in professional conversation at all times here in the office use humor humor can oftentimes be an effective way to respond to an insult for several reasons it weakens the insult it lessens the tension in the situation and it gets others on your side consider using humor the next time someone puts you down you might find it appropriate to even exaggerate or extend the put down which serves to further lessen the power of the insult 5 x research source for example if someone insulted you with the comment your ears are so big you could offer a humorous response by saying oh yes the better to hear you with my dear a reference to little miss riding hood laugh laughing at an insult can be a very powerful response laughter makes the insult seem insignificant and it also communicates that you were not hurt by the insult 6 x research source furthermore it takes away the emotional power that the insulting person was hoping to gain from putting you down agree with the person 7 x research source bullies are typically looking for a reaction or disagreement from you to fuel their desire to cause you pain instead of giving the bully what she is looking for give her the unexpected by agreeing with whatever she said to insult you just say something like you are so right i couldn t agree more and keep agreeing as she continues the insult she will get bored of teasing you of you don t provide a reaction walk away and ignore the bully the person launching the insult is probably seeking for you to engage negatively by walking away you are essentially ignoring the person s insult and the individual himself 8 x research source try to walk away the next time someone says something unkind if you want you can provide a brief comment as you walk away for example if your spouse were to say you are such a slob you response could be okay and then walk away resist returning an insult as tempting and second nature as it may be avoid responding to an insult with an insult of your own it only brings you down to the same level as the insulter you become just as much of a problem as the person who initiated the attack 9 x research source instead of returning an insult simply choose to ignore or even acknowledge it this sends the message to your offender that her insult was completely insignificant and powerless conceal your pain from the insulter nothing excites a bully more than seeing the hurt and pain that he has inflicted on his victim don t give a bully the pleasure of witnessing your pain doing so only confirms that his insult worked just as he planned instead keep a smile on your face and tell yourself i will not allow this person to see my pain avoid internalizing the insult chance are the insult is really not about you but about the other person s insecurity bullies will oftentimes try to make others feel bad as a way of feeling better about themselves remember that you are not defined by someone else s opinion of you 10 x research source if you find yourself replaying hurtful words in your mind replace the negative words with positive thoughts or words for example if someone insulted you by calling you ugly tell yourself i am beautiful both inside and outside or imagine yourself standing in the mirror wearing your best outfit avoid reacting without thinking first regardless of how tempting it may be to blurt out the first comment that comes to mind or to quickly put up your forbidden middle finger think before you respond 11 x research source delay your response by taking a deep breath and slowly counting down from 10 to one this will give you enough time to be in more control of your emotions allow yourself to be upset it s okay if you are upset when someone says hurtful things feeling hurt after being insulted is natural be okay with truly allowing yourself to feel the hurt it s unhealthy to not personally acknowledge and accept when someone has hurt you take the alone time that you need to privately deal with your pain just try to avoid dwelling on it don t hesitate to talk to someone you trust if you find that you are really struggling with getting over your hurt feelings this will help you to vocalize your feelings and as a result it might allow you to finally move on reflect on your reaction and response you can respond and react to an insult in a number of different ways for example you might feel angry sad vindictive or maybe even resentful towards the individual who insulted you you might have responded by retaliating with an insult or by bursting into to tears take time to analyze why you reacted and responded in the way that you did if for example you recall that the insult made you so angry that you couldn t think clearly take time to reflect on why you could ask yourself what caused me to feel so angry and enraged inside was it the embarrassment of the insult or do i feel that the insult was unwarranted consider whether or not the insult is valid when someone insults you it s helpful to take time to consider a few things think about who the insult came from why it happened and whether the insult is actually true usually if the insult came from someone you respect like a parent teacher or best friend taking the insult into consideration makes sense on the other hand if you were insulted by someone who you don t respect it makes sense to not consider the validity of the insult 12 x research source for example if your mother said stop being lazy and try keeping a job past 30 days take time to reflect on what she said if in fact you are now unemployed and just quit your third job in six months the statement is actually not an insult but the truth though not stated in an ideal way you can use that revealed truth for self improvement acknowledge if you are at fault and apologize sometimes it s hard to admit and accept when you are deserving of someone s hurtful words it takes courage to admit and offer an apology when you are at fault however you must acknowledge and admit to your mistakes so you can be a better person 13 x research source for example your brother suffered life threatening injuries after being in a serious car accident when you call him two days later he calls you a heartless human being for choosing to attend a party instead of visiting him in the hospital you re best bet would be saying i m deeply sorry for my selfishness and not putting you first when you really needed me the most i hope in time you will forgive me,Youth

on a loop of when people rejected you what did i do what could i have done differently why were they so mean but get off that loop as soon as possible these people do not define who you are and their opinion is only an opinion not a fact think about the positive qualities you possess like being kind compassionate caring and generous and your unique abilities such as being a great dancer and big

think next you may miss what the other person is saying listen to what the other person is saying and ask questions that build on what is said for instance if someone tells you i like to garden ask what kind of plants or flowers do you grow or how did you get into gardening active listening means you put your attention onto what is being said and show interest in it and the person don t be

control over your actions or emotions engaging the person means you are meeting him or her on the same level you don t need to engage this person and there s no use putting any of your energy into the situation remember that you choose your response is it worth engaging with this person it may be better to just walk away and not even bother withdraw if someone is harassing you or egging you on calmly tell this person that you are not interested in engaging with him or her remember the person can only bully you if you give him or her power over your emotions once you no longer seem to care what this person thinks he or she may become bored or disinterested if the person persists ignore the person say i don t want to talk to you or this doesn t interest me remember that you have control over how or if you react if it isn t worth your time say so keep a wide perspective ask yourself will i remember this situation in 1 year what about 5 years will this affect my life then if not determine to spend your energy and time elsewhere also ask yourself if these are people that will continue to be in your life for a long time if you have plans to go to college or move it s likely these people will be gone from your life soon enough be funny if someone is being mean to you respond with a joke or with some humor humor completely disarms someone trying to hurt you and he or she
