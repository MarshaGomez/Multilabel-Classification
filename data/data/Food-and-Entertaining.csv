how to make edible water bubbles,an edible water bubble or bottle is water that has been solidified into a bubble like shape it is made from water sodium alginate and calcium lactate if you prefer something more flavorful you might enjoy a japanese raindrop cake instead the raindrop cake itself is flavorless unless you sweeten it with vanilla sugar or drizzle sweet syrup on top,mix 1 gram of sodium alginate with 1 cup 240 ml of water use a kitchen or a digital scale to measure out 1 gram of sodium alginate place it into a bowl then add 1 cup 240 ml of water mix the 2 ingredients together using an immersion blender until the sodium alginate dissolves you can purchase sodium alginate online it is a natural ingredient that comes from brown seaweed if you don t have an immersion blender you could try a regular blender or a whisk don t worry if the mixture develops air bubbles these will go away as you prepare the other ingredients mix 5 grams of calcium lactate with 4 cups 950 ml of water pour 4 cups 950 ml of water into a large bowl separate from the first bowl add 5 grams of calcium lactate stir the 2 ingredients together with a spoon until the calcium lactate dissolves make sure that you are using food grade calcium lactate it s a type of salt used in cheese you can buy it online add spoonfuls of sodium alginate water into the calcium lactate water take a deep spoon such as a sauce ladle and scoop up some of the sodium alginate mixture hold the spoon over the surface of the calcium lactate mixture then carefully tip its contents in do this a few more times until the bowl is filled do not overcrowd the bowl with sodium alginate stir the mixture for 3 minutes use a slender spoon to gently stir the contents in the large bowl keep stirring for 3 minutes this will help activate the ingredients and cause the sodium alginate to condense into bubble shapes transfer the bubbles with a slotted spoon into a bowl of water fill a large bowl with plain water the exact amount does not matter as long as it is filled use a slotted spoon to remove the sodium alginate bubbles 1 by 1 and transfer them into the water this will help stop the reaction scoop the bubbles from the water with a slotted spoon set them down onto a plate or into a bowl at this point you can eat drink or slurp the bubbles up you can also give them to young children to play with as a sensory activity because these bubbles don t contain much don t expect them to be very tasty place 1 8 teaspoon plus 1 16 teaspoon of agar powder into a saucepan get out a set of measuring spoons use the 1 8 teaspoon to measure out 1 1 2 scoops of agar powder into a saucepan for best results use japanese style cool agar do not use agar flakes add a pinch of vanilla sugar if desired japanese raindrop cakes are supposed to be flavorless you add the flavor with soybean flour and sugar syrup once you are ready to serve the cakes 3 x research source if you want a sweeter less traditional raindrop cake add 1 pinch of vanilla sugar 4 x research source stir in 3 4 cup 180 ml of water pour the water into the saucepan a little bit at a time stir the water with a spatula until the agar powder dissolves the traditional recipe calls for mineral water but if you can t find that spring or filtered water will do 5 x research source bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat then cook it for 1 minute set the saucepan on a stove turn the heat up to medium and wait for the mixture to come to a boil cook the mixture for 1 minute stirring occasionally then take the saucepan off the stove the timing is important if you undercook the mixture the agar won t dissolve if you overcook the mixture it will condense too much 6 x research source pour the mixture into spherical molds you can use special molds made specifically for raindrop cakes or you can use large round silicone molds instead if your mold is a 2 part mold that looks like a deep tray with wells in it do the following 7 x research source fill the lower mold so that the wells overflow and the tray is half filled wait 2 minutes then add a filling such as an edible flower or strawberry place the upper mold with the holes in it on top press down on the upper mold until the excess gelatin flows out of the holes chill the molds in the fridge for at least 1 hour the raindrop cakes will be set within 1 hour but nothing will happen if you leave them there longer in fact it would be even better if you left them there overnight how many cakes you end up making depends on how many cavities were in your mold de mold the cakes as soon as you are ready to serve them these jiggly treats will melt and lose their shape after only 20 to 30 minutes so plan ahead once you are ready to serve the cakes turn the molds upside down onto serving plates and let the cakes slide out place each cake onto a separate plate serve the cakes with soybean flour and black sugar syrup add 1 2 to 1 tablespoon 2 63 to 5 25 g of roasted soybean flour next to each cake drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons 15 to 30 ml of black or brown sugar syrup over each cake alternatively you can place the syrup next to each cake instead of drizzling it on top you can make your own black or brown sugar syrup follow a simple syrup recipe but use brown sugar instead of white if you can t find soybean flour and black sugar syrup or if you simply don t like them drizzle some honey or agave nectar over the cakes instead 8 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

fruits and veggies at certain times of the year as an added bonus when things are in season they taste better 1 x research source in fall look for produce like pumpkins winter squash cabbage and apples in the winter opt for winter squash cabbage and other root vegetables springtime is great for produce like beets leafy greens spring onions and asparagus summer is a good time for watermelon

though be sure to pick ones that don t have added sugar or salt 2 x research source check your proteins too frozen chicken may be cheaper than fresh and canned salmon and tuna is likely cheaper than fresh fish 3 x research source check out the weekly deals most grocery stores run weekly specials which you can learn about through their weekly ads when something is on sale that s the time to stock up on it most protein can be frozen and saved for later for instance so if your store is running a sale on boneless skinless chicken breasts buy some to use and save for later 4 x trustworthy source usda center for nutrition policy and promotion u s agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research go to source compare prices every time you probably already know to check for the lowest prices on the items you re buying however you may get stuck in a rut buying a certain brand and assuming it s the cheapest because it always has been however be vigilant as prices change all the time occasionally there is a sale on a certain package size or a discount on a run of product that changes what is the most affordable option 5 x trustworthy source usda center for

family will eat use coupons take advantage of coupons when you come across them however only use them for the foods you would buy anyway if you re buying something you don t normally buy even if it is

you ll make up for it in flavor some farmer s markets even accept snap choose cheaper ingredients not all healthy ingredients are expensive in fact many healthy ingredients are cheap take each category of food you need to buy and figure out options in each one for instance in whole grains you can try oatmeal brown rice bulgur popcorn and whole wheat bread and pasta for vegetables pick ones

them in olive oil or spray them with cooking spray and then spread them out on a large baking sheet in a single layer sprinkle salt and pepper on top and any other seasoning you want bake them at 350 degrees fahrenheit 177 celsius until crispy about 15 minutes you can also make yourself individual cups of fruits and veggies for instance cut up oranges apples and grapefruit and toss them with a tiny bit of honey spoon them into small reusable containers so you can grab them any time you can do the same with veggies cut them into bite sized pieces and put them in reusable bags spoon out homemade hummus into individual containers to go with them boil up your own stocks and broths stocks and broths are a great way to start out soups but buying them in cans or cartons can get expensive plus they re often loaded with extra sodium making your own at home results in better quality and it s cheaper too 22 x research source you can even make a stock with your scraps save the bits of vegetables you have leftover such as onion skins the ends of carrots and the tops of celery when you eat a chicken save the bones and the bits of meat freeze them in a bag until you have enough when you do throw them in a pot and cover them with water boil them covered on low heat for six to eight hours or until you have a stock with a flavor you like strain it and your stock is ready once you have your stock you can portion it out in small containers and freeze it branch out into making other foods lots of foods besides snacks and broths can be made cheaper at home for instance if you eat yogurt often making your own yogurt might be a good option for bread consider investing in a bread making machine so you can make your own bread at the push of a button 23 x research

trip,purchase packages of dry ice before you can pack materials using dry ice you ll have to purchase some you can buy packages of dry ice at most butcher shops and grocery stores some ups stores or fedex stores may sell dry ice get the right quality material for packing once you ve obtained dry ice you need material to pack it safely dry ice releases carbon dioxide which can be hazardous if released through the package rupturing a rupture can be caused by pressure pushed down on a package during shipments therefore the material you use should allow the release of some pressure 1 x research source you can use good quality fiberboard also known as corrugated cardboard which you can purchase online or at a local hardware store you can also use plastic or wooden boxes to ship with dry ice do not use steel drums or jerrycans to ship dry ice add a layer of styrofoam to the box it s a good idea to layer the box with styrofoam some even advise mailing the box in a styrofoam cooler which you would then place inside another container make sure the styrofoam you use is at least 2 inches thick in length take precautions when handling dry ice when packing your container with packages of dry ice use gloves dry ice is very cold and can cause serious burns if it comes into contact with bare skin pack the box wrap the food in plastic wrap or place in paper bags prior to packing you want to make sure the food and dry ice are packed together tightly use newspaper or cellulose to make sure it s packed tight this provides extra insulation keeping your perishables fresh if you re using a styrofoam cooler do not seal it completely as this can prevent the package from releasing pressure 2 x research source packs of dry ice should be on the bottom followed by food items you should alternate between dry ice and food items filling in excess gaps with bubble wrap and newspaper until the box is full add the correct addresses you will need to label the box for shipping as with any other container you will need to put your address as well as the address of the recipient you can write this directly on the box or get adhesive labels at a local post office where you can

presented with the proper forms 5 x research source you may have to fill out what is called a shipper s declaration this is a slip that includes basic information about yourself and the recipient you will also need to put in some numbers indicating what hazardous material you are shipping the worker at the post office should be able to help you with the form consider the shipping durations when shipping with dry ice you want to make sure the dry ice will preserve perishables for the proper amount of time overnight shipping is usually best especially when shipping items like meat however if the meat is vacuum packed 2 day shipping may be sufficient unless you know temperatures outside will be below freezing do not opt for anything over 2 day shipping 6 x research source add extra labels

how to make liquid smoke,liquid smoke is a powerful and flavorful cooking ingredient that you can add to meats and other foods to give them a smoky barbecue flavor it is possible to make your own liquid smoke at home but you do need a chimenea smoker or grill that has a chimney on it the process is very simple but it does take quite a bit of time the trick is to capture the smoky condensation that s released when you smoke wood chips on the grill smoker or fire,start up a gas grill for an easy liquid smoke you can also use a gas grill to make liquid smoke push in the knob turn it to ignite and press the starter when the flame is lit set the temperature to high and let the barbecue preheat to about 500 f 260 c preheat a smoker for a basic and tasty smoke flavor you can also use a dedicated meat smoker to generate the smoke for this project get a chimney starter full of charcoal burning when the charcoal has burned and the coals are red hot transfer the coals to the smoker spread out the coals on the charcoal pan and let the smoker heat up to high heat or about 300 f 149 c smokers typically cook foods at a lower temperature than grills because they are designed to cook through smoking rather than direct heat fire up a charcoal grill for an extra smoky liquid smoke place a piece of newspaper in the bottom of a chimney starter which is a metal container used to start charcoal fires stuff the rest of the starter with charcoal light the newspaper in the bottom and wait for the charcoal to ignite burn and turn gray 1 x research source pick up the chimney starter with tongs pour the hot coals into the bowl and spread them out under the center of the grill leave the grill to preheat for about 20 minutes until it reaches about 500 f 260 c make a fire in a chimenea for a woody smoke flavor remove the lid from the top of the chimenea which is a freestanding fireplace you can use outdoors place crumpled newspaper in the bottom of the chimenea crisscross a handful of dry twigs on top of the newspaper ignite the newspaper in multiple places when the twigs are burning add one or two small logs 2 x research source when the fire is established add a couple of larger logs to get the chimenea nice and hot wood fires typically reach temperatures around 500 and 600 f 260 and 316 c let those burn down so you re left with a bed of hot glowing coals choose your wood chips you can use just about any wood you like for smoking and making liquid smoke some of the most popular woods include apple cherry peach birch hickory oak pecan maple and mesquite 3 x research source mesquite and hickory woods will have the smokiest taste of all the wood types while the fruit woods will impart a slightly sweet and fruity aroma soak the wood chips for 30 minutes wood chips are small and can ignite easily so it s important to soak them before smoking transfer about 2 cups 180 g of chips to a large bowl and cover the chips with water let the chips soak for half an hour larger wood chunks don t have to be soaked prior to smoking 4 x research source drain the wood chips transfer the chips to a colander leave them in the colander for about five minutes to allow excess water to drain out this will help the wood heat up faster wrap the chips in foil transfer the drained chips or chunks into the center of a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the sides of the foil to make an open pouch to hold the chips you can use a wood chip smoker box instead of the foil if you have one place the chips in the box and put on the lid place the chips on the grill or coals use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up the package of wood chips making sure the foil doesn t open up on a charcoal or gas barbecue place the pack of chips directly on the grill to the side of the charcoal or flame in a smoker place the chips on the grill above the charcoal in a chimenea place the foil directly on the hot embers cook food on the smoker as you smoke the wood you can cook meat vegetables or other food on the smoker while you re capturing the liquid smoke 5 x research source not only will this make the most of the hot smoker but it will also impart a unique flavor to your liquid smoke cooking and making liquid smoke at the same time works best with a smoker because you don t have to disturb the smoke catching assembly to flip or test the food until the end you can cook food on a grill when you re making liquid smoke but you ll have to carefully remove the bundt pan mixing bowl and ice from the chimney to flip or check the food protect your hands with oven mitts or silicone gloves before touching the bundt pan place a bundt pan on top of the chimney close the lid on the smoker or grill slide the bundt pan over the top of the chimney so the chimney is venting through the hole in the middle of the pan on a chimenea place the pan on the grate at the top of the chimney a bundt pan is ideal for this job because the hole in the center of the pan will allow heat and moisture to rise through the middle cover the bundt pan with a mixing bowl find a heat proof metal bowl that s the same diameter as the bundt pan turn the bowl over and use it as a lid to cover the pan below now the heat smoke and moisture that rise through the center of the bundt pan will be trapped by the bowl and collect in the pan below 6 x research source cover the bowl with ice place a few frozen ice packs on top of the upside down metal bowl the difference in temperature between the hot smoke and the cold bowl will cause a smoky condensation to form on the top of the bowl this will then drip down into the bundt pan as liquid smoke that you can collect 7 x research source instead of ice packs you can also use a bag of ice or a freezer bag filled with ice allow the wood chips to smoke for an hour you ll know they re done when the food is cooked or when the coals burn out an hour will give the bowl and bundt pan setup enough time to collect at least a few teaspoons several milliliters of liquid collect the liquid from the bundt pan when the coals have burned out and the wood chips have released all of their smoke carefully remove the bowl and bundt pan from the chimney protect your hands with gloves as the metal may still be very hot bottle the liquid smoke remove the bowl from the top of the bundt pan place a funnel into a small glass jar and pour the contents of the bundt pan into the jar remove the funnel and seal the jar with an airtight lid store the liquid smoke at room temperature until you re ready to use it liquid smoke can be used to flavor barbecue sauces marinades beans and other foods for the best results use the liquid smoke within 6 months,Food-and-Entertaining
how to make edible water bubbles,an edible water bubble or bottle is water that has been solidified into a bubble like shape it is made from water sodium alginate and calcium lactate if you prefer something more flavorful you might enjoy a japanese raindrop cake instead the raindrop cake itself is flavorless unless you sweeten it with vanilla sugar or drizzle sweet syrup on top,mix 1 gram of sodium alginate with 1 cup 240 ml of water use a kitchen or a digital scale to measure out 1 gram of sodium alginate place it into a bowl then add 1 cup 240 ml of water mix the 2 ingredients together using an immersion blender until the sodium alginate dissolves you can purchase sodium alginate online it is a natural ingredient that comes from brown seaweed if you don t have an immersion blender you could try a regular blender or a whisk don t worry if the mixture develops air bubbles these will go away as you prepare the other ingredients mix 5 grams of calcium lactate with 4 cups 950 ml of water pour 4 cups 950 ml of water into a large bowl separate from the first bowl add 5 grams of calcium lactate stir the 2 ingredients together with a spoon until the calcium lactate dissolves make sure that you are using food grade calcium lactate it s a type of salt used in cheese you can buy it online add spoonfuls of sodium alginate water into the calcium lactate water take a deep spoon such as a sauce ladle and scoop up some of the sodium alginate mixture hold the spoon over the surface of the calcium lactate mixture then carefully tip its contents in do this a few more times until the bowl is filled do not overcrowd the bowl with sodium alginate stir the mixture for 3 minutes use a slender spoon to gently stir the contents in the large bowl keep stirring for 3 minutes this will help activate the ingredients and cause the sodium alginate to condense into bubble shapes transfer the bubbles with a slotted spoon into a bowl of water fill a large bowl with plain water the exact amount does not matter as long as it is filled use a slotted spoon to remove the sodium alginate bubbles 1 by 1 and transfer them into the water this will help stop the reaction scoop the bubbles from the water with a slotted spoon set them down onto a plate or into a bowl at this point you can eat drink or slurp the bubbles up you can also give them to young children to play with as a sensory activity because these bubbles don t contain much don t expect them to be very tasty place 1 8 teaspoon plus 1 16 teaspoon of agar powder into a saucepan get out a set of measuring spoons use the 1 8 teaspoon to measure out 1 1 2 scoops of agar powder into a saucepan for best results use japanese style cool agar do not use agar flakes add a pinch of vanilla sugar if desired japanese raindrop cakes are supposed to be flavorless you add the flavor with soybean flour and sugar syrup once you are ready to serve the cakes 3 x research source if you want a sweeter less traditional raindrop cake add 1 pinch of vanilla sugar 4 x research source stir in 3 4 cup 180 ml of water pour the water into the saucepan a little bit at a time stir the water with a spatula until the agar powder dissolves the traditional recipe calls for mineral water but if you can t find that spring or filtered water will do 5 x research source bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat then cook it for 1 minute set the saucepan on a stove turn the heat up to medium and wait for the mixture to come to a boil cook the mixture for 1 minute stirring occasionally then take the saucepan off the stove the timing is important if you undercook the mixture the agar won t dissolve if you overcook the mixture it will condense too much 6 x research source pour the mixture into spherical molds you can use special molds made specifically for raindrop cakes or you can use large round silicone molds instead if your mold is a 2 part mold that looks like a deep tray with wells in it do the following 7 x research source fill the lower mold so that the wells overflow and the tray is half filled wait 2 minutes then add a filling such as an edible flower or strawberry place the upper mold with the holes in it on top press down on the upper mold until the excess gelatin flows out of the holes chill the molds in the fridge for at least 1 hour the raindrop cakes will be set within 1 hour but nothing will happen if you leave them there longer in fact it would be even better if you left them there overnight how many cakes you end up making depends on how many cavities were in your mold de mold the cakes as soon as you are ready to serve them these jiggly treats will melt and lose their shape after only 20 to 30 minutes so plan ahead once you are ready to serve the cakes turn the molds upside down onto serving plates and let the cakes slide out place each cake onto a separate plate serve the cakes with soybean flour and black sugar syrup add 1 2 to 1 tablespoon 2 63 to 5 25 g of roasted soybean flour next to each cake drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons 15 to 30 ml of black or brown sugar syrup over each cake alternatively you can place the syrup next to each cake instead of drizzling it on top you can make your own black or brown sugar syrup follow a simple syrup recipe but use brown sugar instead of white if you can t find soybean flour and black sugar syrup or if you simply don t like them drizzle some honey or agave nectar over the cakes instead 8 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

experience,bring water and vinegar to boil in a large sturdy pot pour 8 cups 1 9 l of water into a heavy pot add 0 5 cups 120 ml of white vinegar place the pot on the stove and bring the liquid to a boil 1 x research source the vinegar will help to tenderize the tough turtle meat making it easier to cook you should do this to turtle meat before including it in any recipes add your turtle meat to the boiling water and reduce the heat carefully place large pieces in turtle meat into the pot using metal tongs make sure that all of the meat is submerged in the boiling water and vinegar once all of the pieces are in the pot reduce the heat on the stove burner to a simmer 2 x research source let the meat simmer for 60 minutes to soften it place a lid on the pot allow the meat to simmer for an hour this should be enough time to tenderize the meat without making it soggy or water logged 3 x research source set a timer for 60 minutes so you don t let the meat simmer for too long turn off the heat and remove the turtle pieces from the pot after 60 minutes turn off the stove burner using metal tongs remove each piece of turtle meat and place them all on a large plate allow them to cool for 5 10 minutes 4 x research source peel meat off of the bones using your fingers most turtle meat recipes will require you to de bone the meat after the boiled meat cools use your fingers to gently pull the meat away from the bones discard the bones and separate the dark and white meat if you wish 5 x research source make an egg wash with 1 egg and 2 tablespoons 30 ml of water crack an egg into a small bowl pour 2 tablespoons 30 ml of water into the bowl use a fork to stir the mixture rapidly for 1 minute to make an egg wash 6 x research source set the bowl aside to use the mixture after a few

350 degrees 8 x research source dip the meat in the egg wash and then the coating mix until it is covered pick up each piece of turtle meat and gently dip it in the egg wash until it is coated immediately after dip it into the dry coating mix coat the entire surface of each piece of meat 9 x research source to ensure that the coating doesn t fall off while cooking it let the raw coated turtle meat sit for 5 minutes so the mixture binds to the meat cook the turtle meat in the oil for about 5 minutes until it floats drop the pieces of meat into the hot oil leave them for around 5 minutes when they float to the top remove them using metal tongs 10 x research source place fried turtle meat on a layer of paper towels to cool then serve it with a side dish of your choice be very careful while cooking to avoid getting splashed with hot oil store fried turtle in the fridge for 3 4 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months put fried turtle meat in the fridge no later than 2 hours after it is served to store it without the risk of bacteria place it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for no longer than 4 days when it should be throw away to keep fried turtle for up to 4 months place it in a freezer safe zip lock bag or container and put it in the freezer 11 x research source note that fried foods are best when eaten right away and will not taste as good when reheated reheat fried turtle in the over rather than the microwave which will leave it soggy bring 1 5 pounds 24 oz of meat and 4 5 cups 1 1 l of water to a boil pour 4 5 cups 1 1 l of water into a heavy 16 cups 3 8 l saucepan add all of your turtle meat to the pan bring the water to a boil 12 x research source if foam develops while boiling skim it off with a large spoon after the water has reached a boil reduce the heat add 1 onion 1 bay leaf cayenne pepper and salt to the saucepan for flavor quart 1 onion and put it into the saucepan drop one large bay leaf into the saucepan as well add 25 teaspoons 0 042 fl oz of cayenne pepper and 1 25 teaspoons 0 208 fl oz of salt 13 x research source you can substitute or omit these ingredients if you wish to achieve a different flavor cover the saucepan and let the mixture simmer for 2 hours place a lid over the saucepan set the burner to a very low temperature set a timer for 2 hours and leave the mixture there to simmer 14 x research source simmering this mixture will make a rich turtle broth for your soup remove the meat and strain the broth use metal tongs to take out the large pieces of turtle set them aside on a plate use a large sieve to strain the broth to remove the bay leaf onion and any remaining pieces of turtle meat 15 x research source strain the broth into another large pot or bowl melt 5 tablespoons 2 5 fl oz of butter in the large saucepan place 5 tablespoons 2 5 fl oz of cubed butter into your saucepan set your stove burner to medium heat gently stir the butter with a wooden spoon until it is melted entirely 16 x research source wash and dry your saucepan before starting this step or use another clean 16 cups 3 8 l saucepan add 1 diced onion and 0 33 cups 78 ml of flour to the melted butter chop

how to boil dumplings,whether you make your dumplings fresh or get them frozen you can cook them quickly by boiling them raw dumplings are often boiled in water but southern drop dumplings can be simmered in stock or broth for additional flavor chinese dumplings can also be boiled briefly in a pan to become potstickers when the dumplings look soft and transparent they are ready to be enjoyed as is or with a dipping sauce,make the dough for the dumplings if you haven t already a basic dough can be made by mixing flour water and salt together in a large bowl with a wooden spoon knead the dough and let it rest for about 2 hours when it is ready cut it up into small chunks you can drop the dough balls directly into the water or roll them out to turn them into wrappers for chinese dumplings 1 x research source you may also be able to buy fresh uncooked dumplings ask around at local restaurants that serve fresh dumplings fill and fold the wrappers chinese dumplings are often filled with mixtures of meat and vegetables for example cook up a pork and cabbage filling using ground pork napa cabbage soy sauce and herbs and spices place a small amount of filling in the center of the wrapper then fold the wrapper over on itself add different ingredients to customize the filling for instance you can make a filling out of pork and cabbage or out of vegetables 2 x research source freeze dumplings if you aren t cooking them right away avoid leaving the dumplings out at room temperature for more than 30 minutes to preserve them place a piece of parchment paper over a baking sheet dust the paper with flour or cornstarch arrange the dumplings in a single layer on the paper then put the tray in the oven for 30 minutes once the dumplings freeze move them to airtight containers or freezer bags 3 x research source freezing is especially important for filled dumplings the dough will absorb moisture from the filling and fall apart when you cook it bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat fill a large pot about ⅔ full with cold water and place it on your stove to speed up the boiling time cover the pot first wait for the water to rapidly bubble 4 x research source stir a small batch of dumplings into the water cook a small number of dumplings at any given time you can add about 8 dumplings to an average sized pot the dumplings should form a single layer at the bottom of the pan stir them in so they don t stick together 5 x research source frozen homemade dumplings do not need to be thawed if you buy preserved dumplings like the kind from your supermarket freezer aisle you can usually let them thaw for about 15 minutes as you boil to the water or prepare a dipping sauce if you have a particularly big pot or small dumplings you may be able to cook the dumplings in larger batches wait 3 to 4 minutes for the dumplings to float the dumplings will bob up to the surface after a few minutes stay near the pot to avoid overcooking them check to see if the dumplings look cooked through and remove any that have fallen apart 6 x research source boil the dumplings for 6 minutes until they look transparent after the dumplings rise to the surface leave them in the pot for a little bit longer the inner part of the dumpling including the filling for chinese dumplings tends to cook slower than the outer portion when the dumplings have cooked evenly they should appear puffed up and transparent 7 x research source you can also try adding 1 2 cup 120 ml of cold water to the pot after the dumplings rise wait for the water to boil and the dumplings to float again repeat this until they are cooked through 8 x research source move the dumplings immediately to a serving plate too much water is bad for the dumplings so fish them out with a slotted spoon right away place them in a single layer on a plate or tray avoid stacking them or else they may absorb water and fall apart 9 x research source you can pour the pot s contents into a strainer as well to drain the water store leftover dumplings in an airtight container in the refrigerator put the dumplings in a sealed plastic container cooked dumplings will last about 4 days this way in the freezer they last up to 3 months and may become soggy and tasteless when stored for longer than that raw homemade dumplings should be put in a resealable freezer bag squeeze as much air out of the bag as you can the dumplings will last at least 2 weeks in the freezer possibly a few months and can quickly be cooked when you need them mix the dough if you are making fresh dumplings mix together flour baking soda sugar and salt in a bowl gradually mix in butter to bring the dough together mix in some milk afterwards to soften it 10 x research source another way is to buy prepared dough or frozen drop dumplings defrost frozen dumplings first boil water or stock over high heat on the stove water works fine but consider using any kind of stock to give the dumplings more flavor you can also boil a soup or stew such as one with carrots peas and chicken get the liquid nice and bubbly 11 x research source drop the dough into the boiling liquid make sure all of the dumplings are a similar size so they cook at the same rate you can scoop the dough up with a spoon then push it off into the pot continue doing this until all of the dough chunks are in the pot 12 x research source keep the dumplings relatively small about the size of a spoon large dumplings have a tendency to cook unevenly which means you get a mouthful of raw dough when you bite into them cover and simmer the dumplings over medium heat for 15 minutes turn the heat down on the stove so the liquid doesn t overflow the pot cover the pot to trap the remaining heat in then set your timer the dumplings will be soft and flavorful when they re done 13 x research source serve the dumplings in the liquid they were cooked in drop dumplings are often served as is all you need is a serving spoon or ladle scoop out the dumplings and broth then pour them into a bowl to enjoy them 14 x research source you can use a slotted spoon to remove the dumplings if you boiled them in water or don t want the broth store the dumplings for up to 3 days in the refrigerator pour the dumplings and broth into a resealable plastic container if possible separate the dumplings from the liquid so they don t get soggy so quickly for better results make as many dumplings as you need for the dish and don t try to store them the broth can last about 1 week in the refrigerator and 3 months in the freezer so you may be better off making fresh dumplings and adding them to the broth when you want to use it again you can try storing the dumplings in the freezer but chances are they will get mushy and not taste very good even when separated from the liquid heat cooking oil over medium heat in a nonstick skillet pour about 1 tablespoon 15 ml of olive or vegetable oil into a pan heat the oil until it shimmers and appears about to smoke 15 x research source make sure the pan is non stick or cast iron so the dumplings don t stick and tear apart when you move them later place the potstickers in the pan when cooking the dumplings keep the folded side facing up the thicker side with the filling should be against the pan if you can t get them to stand up you can also lay them flat in the pan cook only about 8 to 12 dumplings at a time keeping them in a single layer so all the dumplings are in the oil 16 x research source potstickers are basically the same as chinese dumplings except they are seared and boiled in a pan they may be smaller and thinner than dumplings boiled in a pot the amount of potstickers you can cook at a time depends on the size of your pan and dumplings pour 2 tablespoons 30 ml of water into the pan add the water making sure the stove s heat is set to medium using a mixing spoon or another utensil swirl the oil and water around to coat the dumplings in it 17 x research source swirling the liquids around in the pot a little leads to a better sear so make sure all the dumplings get covered cover the pan and cook them for 3 to 4 minutes the water will evaporate as the potstickers boil when this happens uncover the pans and check to see if the potstickers are cooked through they should look transparent and feel soft and warm in the center 18 x research source the potstickers should also have a golden brown crust on the bottom you can lift them with tongs to check if they don t leave the cover off the pan and cook them until they brown cook the potstickers in water for 4 minutes if they aren t done add about 1 3 cup 79 ml of water to the pan cover the pan again and let the dumplings continue to boil most of the water should evaporate by the time the potstickers are finished if there is a little water left you can uncover the pan and let the water evaporate 19 x research source frozen dumplings may need the extra cooking time for fresh potstickers you may need to use a little more water to get them to finish without burning serve the potstickers with a dipping sauce take the dumplings out of the pan right away so they cannot continue to boil or brown use a slotted spoon to scoop them out and place them on a plate potstickers are often eaten with a dipping sauce such as a mixture of dark vinegar soy sauce and sesame oil 20 x research source the best time to make the dipping sauce is while you wait for the water to boil if you make fresh dumplings you can also do it while waiting for the dough to rise customize the dipping sauce with different ingredients like rice wine vinegar and scallions store leftover potstickers in a resealable container in the refrigerator the potstickers will last about 3 days in the refrigerator keep them covered so they don t absorb moisture and fall apart since they can be cooked fast and in small batches you may not even get a chance to store them before they re all gone but consider storing the raw dumplings and cooking only what you plan on eating they also store well in the freezer lay them out on parchment paper to freeze for 30 minutes then move them into a resealable bag they should last about 3

how to make blue food colouring,blue food coloring can be used to turn many different foods and beverages like frostings water and cocktails blue while you can buy blue food coloring in any grocery store you can also experiment with your own homemade version using red cabbage the blue you ll achieve with homemade food coloring will be more muted and subtle than what you can buy in the store but if you re looking for a fun diy project making homemade blue food coloring is a great choice,chop the cabbage place an entire head of red cabbage onto a cutting board cut off the stem and discard it hold the cabbage steady with one hand and with a large chef s knife roughly chop the cabbage into small chunks the cutting doesn t have to be precise but smaller pieces are better because you ll get more color from the cabbage 1 x research source red cabbage contains anthocyanin a purplish pigment that will dissolve in water you can collect purple cabbage water to turn it into blue food coloring 2 x research source rinse the cabbage transfer the cabbage pieces to a large bowl cover the cabbage with water and use your hand to stir the cabbage around in the water pour the cabbage into a colander to drain out the excess water boil the cabbage in water transfer the cabbage to a large saucepan cover the cabbage with enough water to cover it completely about 8 cups 1 9 l put on the lid and bring the water to a boil over medium high heat when the water comes to a boil reduce the heat to medium and continue simmering for 20 minutes 3 x research source as the cabbage boils the anthocyanin will leach into the water turning it purple strain the cabbage remove the pot from the heat insert a colander into a large glass or metal mixing bowl pour the cabbage and the purple water into the colander the colander will catch the cabbage and the purple water will drain into the bowl below 4 x research source the cabbage is cooked and ready to eat set it aside to cool and then use it in soups stews stir fries and other dishes 5 x research source boil down the purple water pour the collected purple water into a medium saucepan bring the water to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat to medium high continue simmering the water with the lid off for about 75 minutes to reduce the purple water cook the mixture until most of the water has evaporated and there s only ½ cup 118 ml of liquid left 6 x research source as the liquid cooks the water will evaporate and the liquid will reduce leaving behind a more concentrated and more vibrant purple water let the mixture cool when the water has reduced remove the saucepan from the heat set the pan aside to cool to room temperature this could take about 30 minutes when the purple concentrate has cooled pour it into a clean mason jar or other clear container use a clear jar so you can see the color change as you add the baking soda add some baking soda measure ⅛ teaspoon 0 6 g of baking soda and pour it into the jar with the purple concentrate stir the mixture to dissolve the baking soda in the water and allow the bubbles to subside if necessary the purple pigment in the cabbage reacts differently with acids and bases in an acidic environment the anthocyanin will become redder when you mix the anthocyanin with an alkaline ingredient like baking soda it will become bluer 7 x research source test the color measure ¼ cup 59 ml of a white liquid such as milk soy milk or coconut milk into a clear glass you can also test the color on a small amount of frosting before dyeing the entire batch add a few drops of the food coloring and stir to incorporate the dye into the liquid the color will be pale but it will give you a good idea of the blue shade you ve achieved 8 x research source the testing step is particularly important if you re going to use the dye to color frosting or something similar because the ph of the frosting will alter the color of the dye add more baking soda if necessary continue adding baking soda in ⅛ teaspoon 0 6 g increments and testing the color until you achieve the desired shade of blue don t add more than ½ teaspoon 2 4 g of baking soda otherwise the food coloring will taste salty and metallic 9 x research source the baking soda won t make the color darker but it will make the dye bluer make blue ice cream homemade ice cream is a fun and tasty project and the best part is that you can completely customize the ice cream according to your taste 10 x research source transfer the ice cream base to the ice cream maker turn on the machine and add the blue food

including the blue lagoon and the blue hawaiian to turn your drinks blue add 1 to 2 tablespoons 15 to 30 ml of blue food coloring to any clear or light colored liquids such as water vodka or even milk many blue drinks use an alcoholic liqueur called blue curaçao for the blue coloring but you can use your food coloring instead to make non alcoholic versions avoid using the color for foods that will be heated when you bake foods like cakes and cookies chemical reactions occur when the different ingredients interact and heat up these reactions can change the color of your dye from blue to something unexpected you can experiment with your blue food coloring and baked goods but be warned that the dye may react unpredictably and could turn a brown or unpleasant color 13 x research source store leftovers in the refrigerator if you have any leftover blue food coloring transfer it to an airtight container and keep it chilled in the refrigerator the food coloring will last for at least 2

how to tell if you re a super taster,if you re a foodie you might be interested to know if you re a supertaster super tasters experience more intense flavors when they eat because they have an increased amount of taste receptors on their tongues you can see how many taste receptors you have by using food dye and counting them or if you re old enough to drink swirling wine around your tongue will also increase their visibility you might also take note of how you experience certain flavors although that s not a sure fire test only 25 of people in the world are supertasters but you could be one of them,place 3 to 4 drops of blue food coloring onto your tongue swirl the dye onto your tongue a little to make sure it coats the entire top of your tongue the food dye will help the small bumps papillae stand out from the surface of your tongue 1 x research source you can also use green food dye just avoid using red or pink as it s too close to the color of your tongue if you don t have any food dye and if you re of legal drinking age swirl red wine in your mouth red wine contains acids and sugars that stimulate the taste receptors on your tongue 2 x research source put a hole punch reinforcement sticker onto your tongue stick out your tongue and place the hole punch sticker on the top of your tongue toward the front since your tongue is wet it may not stick but place it on the top and tilt your head so it stays in place 3 x research source if you don t have a hole punch reinforcement sticker cut a piece of lined paper into a small strip that includes 1 hole punch lay that on the front area of your tongue instead use a magnifying glass and a flashlight to see the papillae better lean into a mirror and shine a flashlight onto your tongue position the magnifying glass at an angle between your face and the mirror where you can see your tongue reflected in the mirror 4 x research source if you don t have a magnifying glass you can also use a magnifying mirror count the number of bumps inside the circular sticker hold your tongue very still and count how many bumps you see inside the circular sticker regular tasters have about 15 to 30 but if you have more than 30 you re a supertaster 5 x research source if you have a friend family member or roommate around ask them to help you count the bumps or double check your tally if you re using a strip of paper and red wine place it on your tongue toward the back where you see larger lumps if you have more than 8 lumps you re a supertaster 6 x research source notice if you tend to avoid naturally bitter foods and drinks bitterness is detected at the back of the tongue where large lumps of papillae are located supertasters have lots of these lumps causing bitterness to be exacerbated if you avoid these foods because they taste so bitter to the point of disgust you could be a supertaster some of the naturally bitter foods supertasters avoid are 7 x research source coffee dark chocolate non sweetened alcoholic beverages like gin and tonics beer ipas bitter pale ales eat green vegetables to see if they taste sour spinach broccoli brussels sprouts kale and collard greens can taste overly bitter and off putting to supertasters if you purposefully avoid these foods for that reason you might be a supertaster 8 x research source keep in mind that if you avoid these foods just because you don t like them that doesn t make you a supertaster eat the greens raw or cooked with little to no oil and seasoning to let the natural flavor of each vegetable come through try spicy foods and note how you react since supertasters experience flavors more intensely than regular tasters spicy peppers will be extremely spicy even to the point of pain that s because supertasters also have more pain receptors on the tongue in addition to more papillae 9 x research source if you avoid jalapeno peppers serrano peppers tabasco peppers cayenne or hot sauce because you experienced pain that could be a sign that you re a supertaster if you like the burn of spicy foods you might still be a supertaster you ve just conditioned yourself to like the sensation eat cilantro to see if it tastes soapy for normal tasters cilantro tastes fresh and citrusy but if you re a supertaster it might taste soapy or metallic eat fresh picked cilantro leaves or dried cilantro to see how you respond 10 x research source some supertasters think cilantro tastes bitter as well notice if you perceive foods to be over seasoned on a regular basis if you regularly find yourself judging food as too salty too peppery or too heavy on the spices you might have more taste receptors on your tongue than the average eater it may seem like you re just a picky eater when really you could be a supertaster 11 x research source however this isn t a sure fire sign because it could be that you just like lightly seasoned foods,Food-and-Entertaining
how to make whipple cream,whipple cream is a type of clay that you use to make toy and decorative baked goods whipple cream is meant to resemble whipped cream and is not edible all you need to make whipple cream is some art clay glue and supplies like a spray bottle and ruler,break your clay into small pieces and place them in the bag in order to get your clay to a mixable consistency you should break it into small pieces take out a large chunk of art clay and break it apart place the pieces in your plastic bag 1 x research source there is no set amount of art clay to use take out as much as you need for your whipple cream more art clay will make more cream if your clay is very thick or dry it can help to work your clay with your fingers to soften it before breaking it into pieces 2 x research source add water in small amounts until you reach the right consistency put some tap water in your spritzer bottle spray in a small amount to start for example spritz the water 10 times then seal your bag leaving a small amount of air in the bag and work the clay with your fingers through the bag keep adding small amounts of water at a time until you reach the right consistency 3 x research source the consistency should be similar to marshmallow fluff if you ve never had marshmallow fluff this feels like slightly hardened whipped cream push the clay to one side of the bag seal the bag and use your fingers to push the clay through the bag you want all your clay concentrated in one side of the bag once the clay is in one side of the bag cut a hole in the corner where the clay sits 4 x research source add glue to soften the whipple cream open the bag again and pour in some school glue as with the water add a small amount at first and then more as necessary you do not want the whipple cream to be too runny but the glue should loosen it slightly add enough glue that the whipple cream is easily squeezed out of the bag 5 x research source pinch the open side of the bag closed while you do this to keep glue from running out of the bag add food coloring if you want a specific color you can add a small bit of food coloring the the whipple cream then work the cream together using your fingers until the color is dispersed throughout if you want a darker color after adding your initial coloring add a bit more food coloring 6 x research source like the other ingredients there is no set amount to add you can add a small amount at first and add more if the color is too light place the bag in a pastry bag insert the nozzle into the pastry bag by putting it in the bag and pushing it through the opening in the corner then put your plastic bag with the whipple cream in the pastry bag push the corner of the plastic bag with the opening into the nozzle in the pastry bag 7 x research source do not substitute different types of glue things like superglue industrial glue or rubber cement should not be used to make whipple cream you should only use school glue such as elmer s glue as this has the right consistency for whipple cream 8 x research source store the whipple cream carefully remove the whipple cream from the pastry bag when you re done using it twist the end of the plastic bag removing most of the air and use a rubber band to secure it in place you can store your whipple cream in a cabinet until you want to use it again 9 x research source if your whipple cream dries out between uses add more water it should last awhile as long as you keep adding water but will dry out in a few months how long whipple cream lasts depends on how often you use it and the temperature of your home make sure children know not to eat the cream if you re using whipple cream for crafts with young children make sure to make it clear the cream is not to be eaten children may mistake whipple cream for food but it does not contain edible ingredients tell children something like i know the whipple cream looks like food but it s bad for you to eat just use it for decoration,Food-and-Entertaining
how to malt corn,malting is the process of partially germinating and then drying grain to preserve its enzymes to malt your own corn you ll need to first steep and germinate the kernels and then dry kiln and clean them by using the right tools and sticking to a schedule you can turn corn into malt to use for things like baking and brewing,use a drill to drill holes in the bottom of a five gallon 20 liter bucket make sure each hole is smaller than the size of a corn kernel 1 x research source place the bucket in an urn of the same size remove the lid of the urn so you can set the bucket inside it s ok if part of the bucket is sticking up out of the top of the urn 2 x research source fill the bucket with about four pounds 1 8 kilograms of corn the corn kernels shouldn t reach the top of the bucket as they will expand during the steeping process 3 x research source pour water into the bucket until the water is one inch higher than the corn you want the extra inch of water because a lot of the water will be absorbed into the corn during the steeping process 4 x research source set the urn thermostat to 77 degrees fahrenheit 25 degrees celsius you want the water to remain this temperature during the entire steeping process 5 x research source let the corn steep in the water for nine hours check back after nine hours and lift the bucket of corn out of the urn let the water in the bucket drain into the urn through the drilled holes 6 x research source let the bucket of corn rest on an elevated surface for three hours the rest period called an air rest will help get rid of co2 and encourage the corn to take up more water during the steeping process when it s finished resting place it back in the urn so it fills up with water 7 x research source alternate between steeping and resting the corn your steeping schedule should look like first steeping nine hours first air rest three hours second steeping nine hours second air rest three hours third steeping nine hours third air rest three hours fourth steeping nine hours remove the bucket of corn from the urn let the water drain back into the urn so only the corn is left in the bucket pour the corn into an eight gallon 30 liter tray you can make the tray yourself out of wood or buy an aluminum tray at the store make sure the sides of the tray are tall enough to keep in all of the corn 8 x research source place a thermometer in the tray to monitor the temperature you want the temperature to be between 72 and 82 degrees fahrenheit 22 and 28 degrees celsius while the corn is germinating 9 x research source if the thermometer reads too high of a temperature move the tray to a darker cooler place if the thermometer reads too low of a temperature place a portable heater or small heat fan that allows you to adjust the temperature near the tray check the thermometer regularly to make sure the tray isn t overheating 10 x research source rinse and stir the corn every 12 hours while it s germinating this will keep the grain moist and prevent heat buildup that naturally occurs during germination 11 x research source let the corn germinate until the shoots are twice as long as the kernels the shoots are the long root looking parts of the corn that emerge during germination you can start the drying process once 70 to 80 percent of the corn has shoots that are twice the length of the kernels 12 x research source dry the corn in a food dehydrator to stop the germination process set the food dehydrator to between 100 and 125 degrees fahrenheit 38 to 52 degrees celsius and leave the corn inside to dry 13 x research source weigh the corn after several hours to check the moisture content you want the corn to be at 10 percent moisture before you increase the temperature in the food dehydrator you ll know the corn is at ten percent moisture when it weighs 5 ounces 14 2 grams less per pound 45 kilograms than it did before you started the malting process 14 x research source increase the temperature when the corn is at ten percent moisture raise it to between 140 and 160 degrees fahrenheit 60 to 71 degrees celsius the corn will be finished drying when it s between three and six percent moisture content or when it s lost three ounces 85 grams per pound 45 kilograms of its original weight the entire drying and process can take between six to eight hours 15 x research source transfer the corn to a baking sheet and put it in the oven for four hours set the oven between 176 and 185 degrees fahrenheit 80 to 85 degrees celsius after four hours the corn will be finished kilning and malting 16 x research source pour the dried malt into a pillowcase tie the pillowcase shut so none of the malt can escape 17 x research source put the pillowcase in the dryer for ten minutes run the dryer on the coolest setting so you don t heat up the malt tumbling the malt will help remove the bitter tasting roots and shoots of the corn 18 x research source separate the malt from the broken off roots and shoots you can do this by hand or you can use a sieve to separate them more easily the malt will look like small dried up corn kernels 19 x research source store your malt in a plastic container with an airtight lid this will prevent oxygen and moisture from damaging the malt over time properly stored malt is good for up to a year 20 x research

how to defrost quickly,while it s always better to defrost meat vegetables and frozen food in the refrigerator sometimes you simply need to thaw some food fast there are several ways to defrost food quickly and safely without giving any bacteria the necessary time to grow in your food which is the main concern when thawing food outside of the fridge meat can be quickly thawed in cold or warm water although warm water is a little riskier if you let some of the water cool for too long veggies thinner cuts of meat noodles and fruits can be easily defrosted in the microwave when it comes to bread and other baked goods opt for the oven to keep your items from getting soggy,place your food in a leak proof plastic bag open your freezer door with your plastic bag in hand place the frozen food inside a sealable plastic bag that will comfortably fit your food you can use multiple plastic bags if you d like to thaw multiple items at once if you take the food out of the freezer and do this on the countertop you could introduce bacteria into the bag so do it in the freezer to keep your food safe 1 x research source ideally you froze your food in an airtight plastic bag and won t have to do this if you stored it in aluminum foil though you have to take the foil off and put it in a bag this is faster than refrigerator thawing and safer than hot water thawing put the bag in a large bowl and fill it with cold tap water take a large glass or metal bowl out of your cabinet the container must be big enough to fully submerge your food in the water place your frozen food item at the bottom of the bowl turn your sink s water on the coldest setting available and fill the bowl with the water 2 x research source depending on how good the water lines in your home are you may need to wait 20 30 seconds to give the cold water time to reach its lowest temperature thaw your food in the cold water for 2 3 hours once your bowl is filled with water submerge your food in the water leave the bowl in your sink or on your countertop the size type and density of your food will determine how long it takes to thaw a 3 4 lb 1 4 1 8 kg package of meat will take 2 3 hours to thaw but smaller items may thaw in as little as 1 hour larger items like frozen turkeys may take up to 12 hours to thaw 3 x research source you can tell if smaller food items are thawed by simply touching them if they re as soft as they d be if they weren t frozen you re good to go larger items may be frozen in the center though making this method a poor choice for thicker foods use a spoon or spatula to weigh the food down if it s floating at the top of the water change the water out every 30 minutes to prevent it from warming the goal when thawing food in cold water is to keep the water significantly colder than room temperature so that dangerous bacteria doesn t grow in your food to keep the water temperature under 40 f 4 c which is the threshold for dangerous bacteria drain the water while refilling it in your sink once every 30 minutes this will ensure that your food stays cold as it thaws 4 x research source cook your food immediately after it s fully thawed remove your food from its packaging and put it on a microwave safe plate select a microwave safe container that will comfortably fit your food item glass is always a safe choice and unpainted ceramic will work as well avoid plastic or styrofoam containers remove the food from its packaging and place it on the plate bowl or container 5 x research source this method works with bread frozen noodles broth fruit and vegetables it isn t the best method for meat though as frozen meat tends to thaw really unevenly in the microwave if you aren t sure if a container is microwave safe flip it upside down and look on the bottom to see if it says microwave safe it may also have the international logo for microwave safe which is 3 wavy lines if you do thaw meat in the microwave only thaw cuts of meat that are less than 2 pounds 0 91 kg use the defrost setting with the proper weight for items with a dedicated defrost button if the food that you re thawing has a dedicated button on the microwave click defrost and then hit the corresponding button then enter the weight of the food item that you re thawing to automatically defrost your food flip it in the microwave when the microwave automatically shuts off halfway through the cook time 6 x research source for example if there is a chicken button your microwave and you have a 1 5 lb 0 68 kg filet put the plate in the microwave and press chicken then enter 1 5 with the number pad and press enter when the microwave stops flip the chicken over with tongs or a spatula and press start again to finish thawing it microwave food items without unique buttons on 50 power for 2 3 minutes for food items that don t have automatic buttons it s usually more efficient to microwave on partial power instead of using the defrost setting use your microwave s power button to adjust the setting place your plate in the microwave and heat it on 50 power for 2 3 minutes based on the size and thickness of the food 7 x research source frozen broccoli or chopped spinach will likely require 2 minutes while frozen cucumbers or potatoes will likely take 3 minutes or more doing this is largely a trial and error process you ll need to inspect the food carefully when flipping it or taking it apart in the microwave to determine when it s thawed and estimate additional cooking times split items without dedicated buttons apart with a fork or spoon after 2 3 minutes once you ve run your first heating cycle open the microwave door use a fork spoon or spatula to spread the food out split it up and break it apart on your plate since microwaves tend to heat unevenly it s essential that you move it around on the plate after heating it for 2 3 minutes 8 x research source if you have a frozen chunk of veggies or noodles split them apart with the point of your fork do this carefully though since the tension may lead to noodles or veggies flying off of your plate heat items without dedicated buttons for another 1 3 minutes on 30 power when you go to split up your food or move around check to see how frozen it is by poking it with your fork spoon or spatula if it s still really solid heat it for another 3 minutes if it s mostly thawed heat it for another 1 minute heat it on 30 power to ensure that you don t overheat your food 9 x research source cook your food immediately after it s been thawed in the microwave preheat your oven to 325 f 163 c and prepare a baking sheet look in your pantry for a rimmed baking sheet take it out and preheat your over to 325 f 163 c do not use a different temperature for different types of bread 10 x research source you can certainly defrost bread entirely in the microwave but it may get soggy as the ice crystals melt into the bread this method may not work with baked goods that contain filling like pie or donuts with cream filling heat full loaves of bread for 15 30 minutes based on their size place your frozen loaf of bread on the baking sheet if you ve got a massive loaf of bread cook it in the oven for 25 30 minutes for smaller thinner loaves heat them for 15 20 minutes take your bread out of the oven using your oven mitt and cut it as you please 11 x research source you do not need to microwave entire loaves of bread before putting them in the oven you should microwave smaller baked goods and sliced bread first if you want them to be soft microwave sliced baked goods on high for 15 25 seconds before baking them grab a microwave safe container like glass or unpainted ceramic and set your bread or other baked goods on it microwave them on high for 15 25 seconds based on the number of slices that you re thawing 12 x research source if you want toasted bread you can skip this step and heat your bread in the oven from frozen microwaving the baked goods ensures that some of the ice from the freezing is absorbed in the bread making it softer you don t need to microwave loaves before heating them in the oven bake your sliced bread and smaller baked goods for 5 minutes at 325 f 163 c once you ve microwaved your sliced baked goods transfer the bread or baked goods on to your baking sheet spread your slices or individual pieces out on the baking sheet face down for a crispier bread or lean the slices against one another like they re in a loaf for softer insides bake your slices or individual pieces for 5 minutes before removing them from the oven 13 x research source even if they aren t sliced this method works for smaller baked goods like individual scones muffins or croissants use an oven mitt to safely remove the pan from the oven fill a large bowl with hot water take a large glass or ceramic bowl out of the cabinet turn the water to your tap on the hottest setting and give it 1 2 minutes to heat up all the way fill the bowl with your water and use a thermometer to see if it s hotter than 125 f 52 c if it is you re good to go if it isn t put the water in a pot and heat it on your stove until it s hotter than 125 f 52 c before putting it back in the bowl 14 x research source this method is the riskiest of all possible options since bacteria can grow on the outer surfaces of your meat as the water cools if done properly it s perfectly safe though to keep your meat safe the water must stay above 100 f 38 c so you ll need to stir the water to avoid pockets of cooler water and replace the water as it cools put your meat in a leak proof plastic bag if you stored your meat in a leak proof plastic bag you don t need to worry about changing the packaging as long as it s airtight if you stored in foil or wax paper though take a large plastic bag to your freezer and open the door in the freezer place your meat in the plastic bag and seal it 15 x research source putting the meat in your bag while it s still in the freezer will ensure that no room temperature air from your room gets into the bag try to force as much of the air out of the bag as possible before sealing it you need to submerge the meat and if you leave a bunch of air inside the meat will float to the top submerge your meat in the water and weigh it down with a slotted spoon place your plastic bag in the water use a slotted spoon to push it to the bottom of the bowl if the bag floats to the surface of the water open the bag a little at the top squeeze the bottom of the bag to force the excess air out and then seal the bag 16 x research source stir the water with your spoon and monitor the water temperature use your slotted spoon to gently stir the water right above your meat the cold cut of meat will make the water surrounding it colder than the water in the other parts of the bowl so stirring lightly keeps the hot water circulating around the meat use your thermometer to check the temperature of the water once every 1 2 minutes 17 x research source stirring also speeds up the thawing process which is important since you re warming the meat to thaw it refill the water as needed to keep it above 100 f 38 c as you stir continue to monitor the temperature if the water falls below 100 f 38 c add more hot water to the bowl after putting it in the sink continue filling the bowl until you ve replaced most of the water and moved the temperature back up beyond 125 f 52 c this will ensure that the water doesn t get cool enough to promote bacteria growth 18 x research source you may need to replace the water 2 3 times depending on how thick your meat is and how hot your tap water is remove your meat after 10 15 minutes and cook it immediately as soon as your meat appears to be thawed remove it from the bowl work quickly to get it in the oven microwave or on the stove before any bacteria can start growing for most filet wing or breast cuts your meat should be thawed after 10 15 minutes 19 x research source you can touch the meat by lifting it out of the bowl with your slotted spoon and pressing it lightly if it s soft and seems like it s no longer frozen it s ready to be cooked,Food-and-Entertaining
how to add umami to your cooking,in cooking there are five tastes sweet salty sour bitter and umami the term umami the fifth taste was coined in 1908 by a japanese professor kikunae ikeda but the flavor has been incorporated in food around the world for centuries umami adds the meaty savory quality to many foods and can be included in home cooking by using a variety of ingredients and flavor combinations 1 x research source,add cheese to pasta dishes and soups parmesan has a salty strong taste that only gets stronger with age add it to pasta sauces either on top of the dish or into the sauce as it cooks to create a deeper flavor 2 x research source add parmesan rinds to soups like minestrone to achieve the same effect use anchovies to add the umami taste to a variety of dishes dried or cured anchovies add a salty fishy flavor to food and can be used in many dishes make anchovy butter by combining anchovies and soft butter to top toast or steaks add anchovy paste to pasta sauces to bring out the flavor of the tomatoes and create a more rounded flavor use mushrooms mushrooms have a lot of natural umami flavor and it s even stronger when they re dried 3 x research source add mushrooms to pasta sauce chopped or sliced cooked mushrooms work in white or red sauces use dried mushrooms in soups add porcini or shiitake mushrooms to soups or ramen to bring out the most flavor put tomato paste in your soups and sauces like mushrooms tomatoes have natural umami flavor as well as sweetness tomato paste is a thick concentrated source of tomato flavor and a little goes a long way add a bit of tomato paste in tomato soup beef stews pasta sauces or even gravy 4 x research source add kombu to broths kombu is a type of kelp used often in asian soups to make the base broth boil a few pieces of kombu or other seaweeds to add an earthy fishy umami taste to soups and broths use worcestershire sauce in your cooking made with anchovies molasses vinegar and tamarind worcestershire sauce is a great way to add umami to lots of dishes add it to soups pasta sauces and marinades add it to a marinade for beef or chicken to bring out the meaty savory flavor of the dish add a bit of worcestershire sauce to pasta sauces to create a similar effect to parmesan use a fish broth when making soups dashi is a broth used often in japanese cooking that uses kelp and fish to create the umami taste combine dried kelp and bonito flakes in a pot of water and cook until the water takes on the flavors for other variations combine dried kelp and dried anchovies in a pot of water some use dried shiitake mushrooms the white part of green onions or daikon radish as well 5 x research source add soy sauce to the dish soy sauce is created by fermenting soybeans which brings out the natural umami taste of the soy add about a tablespoon of soy sauce to stir fries and fried rice to create the salty savory taste you want substitute soy sauce in if you have no cheese or worcestershire sauce for pasta recipes use fish sauce a strong concentrated condiment fish sauce is made with salt sugar and fermented fish use it as a dipping sauce or in stir fries and other dishes 6 x research source you can also use oyster sauce which is a thicker sauce made with oysters instead of fish add miso paste like soy sauce miso paste is made by fermenting soybeans but there are hundreds of variations all with their own taste add a tablespoon of miso paste to sauces and soups or try it in dressings or on its own in broth 7 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to use stevia,stevia is a calorie free sugar substitute that is created from the stevia plant stevia is popular among health foodies dieters and diabetics because it does not increase blood glucose levels you might use stevia leaf in its refined liquid or powder form or sweeten your food with fresh stevia leaf although high quality refined stevia is generally recognized as safe by the us fda pure stevia leaf does not have fda approval for use in food 1 x trustworthy source us food and drug administration u s government agency responsible for promoting public health go to source,use pure stevia drops perhaps the most popular way to use stevia is in its liquid form a few drops of stevia can be used to replace 1 2 teaspoons of white sugar use stevia drops in drinks hot or cold sauces salad dressings or soups 2 x research source stevia can have a bit of a bitter and or licorice y aftertaste experiment with the number of drops you need to gain optimal sweetness with minimal aftertaste add flavored stevia to beverages stevia drops are also available in flavored varieties such as lemon lime or root beer add a few drops of flavored stevia to sparkling water for a low calorie alternative to soda 3 x research source read the labels of flavored stevia options avoid flavored stevia that contains aspartame or other chemical sugar replacements try pure stevia extract powder another popular way to use stevia is in its pure powder form this refined stevia looks similar to sugar and can be used anywhere you would normally use powdered sweetener stevia extract powder is more potent than sugar however use half or less than half of the amount of stevia as you normally would for sugar 4 x research source stevia extract powder can be used in drinks hot or cold on cereal or in recipes it can be purchased in large containers or in individual packets you can take along with you look for pure stevia powder read all labels and avoid stevia powder with additives bake with stevia stevia extract powder can be used to replace sugar in baking when you bake with stevia you ll want to use 1 2 the amount of sugar you would normally use or even less this means you will need to add more bulk such as flour and liquid such as milk applesauce or butter to account for this difference 5 x research source when you are just starting out it is best to seek out stevia based baking recipes although stevia can replicate the sweetness of sugar it will not caramelize of liquid stevia or 1 3 1 2 teaspoon about 5 7g of stevia extract powder short read all labels and avoid additives many packaged stevia products contain additional additives such as sucrose or aspartame to mask this these additives are often artificial and unlike pure stevia can have negative effect on your blood sugar 6 x research source be sure to read all labels on your stevia products and seek out products that contain pure refined stevia mask the aftertaste stevia can have a licorice y aftertaste which some find bitter rather than using stevia that contains artificial additives intended to mask the taste you can add a small squirt of agave nectar which has a low glycemic index lemon juice or lime juice to help mask this bitterness use stevia leaves to sweeten tea if you have access to a fresh stevia plant or if you have grown your own you can use fresh stevia leaves as a sweetener this helps you to eliminate the presence of additives and save money to sweeten a cup of hot tea simply remove 1 4 small leaves from your plant and place them in hot water with your tea bag remove the leaves after several minutes 7 x research source although it has been used around the world for thousands of years unrefined stevia leaf has not been approved as a food additive by the fda before using stevia leaf in your food or drink it is best to consult your doctor create dry leaf powder you have two options for drying your stevia leaves you can either pluck 8 or more leaves from your plant and place them between 2 paper towels or simply remove an entire stevia stalk and hang it upside down in either case leave your stevia leaves in a cool dry place for a few days then grind the dry leaves using a mortar and pestle 8 x research source use this green powder to sweeten drinks breakfast cereal or curries 1 teaspoon of this stevia powder is equal to approximately 10 teaspoons of sugar this pure form of stevia will have a licorice y or slightly bitter aftertaste make stevia syrup once you have stevia dry leaf powder you can use this to make a stevia syrup boil 2 cups of distilled water and add 1 teaspoon of dry leaf powder reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 15 minutes or until the water is the consistency of syrup use a cheesecloth to strain out the powder 9 x research source store your stevia syrup in an air tight container in the refrigerator use this syrup in cold drinks fruit salads or sauces remember that this sweetener will be more potent,Food-and-Entertaining
how to prepare a sea salt soak,sea salt is known mostly for being a tastier alternative to table salt but it also has medicinal and relaxing qualities as well a sea salt soak can be used to treat minor infections and wounds as well as sterilize piercings and tattoos whereas a sea salt bath soak can be as relaxing as taking a dip in the ocean sea salt contains no iodine which makes it a perfect for creating saline solutions for keeping wounds clean it mixes with scented oils easily and can be stored in the bathroom to add to calming baths as well,purchase 1 gallon 3 8 l of purified water or purify tap water at home you can pour tap water through a water filter or purchase purified water if you don t have access to one just make sure the bottle is labelled as purified you can find filter pitchers or faucet filters at most grocery and specialty stores the filter removes chemicals that are added to normal tap water which can affect the salinity of the solution 1 x research source pour the purified water into a saucepan and boil it to sterilize it 2 x research source the boiling process will kill any living organisms leaving you with sterile purified water 3 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source if you bought distilled water instead of purifying tap water it should already be sterilized allow the water to cool and add 9 g 1 8 tbsp of sea salt after letting the water cool slightly add sea salt and let it dissolve completely if you need to prepare more medicinal sea salt soak add another 9 g 1 8 tbsp of sea salt for every extra 1 litre 4 2 c of distilled water you will use a typical saline solution contains 0 9 salt content similar to levels of salt in the human body 4 x research source if your water has large chunks of salt left over you need to either strain it out or add more water pour the solution into a shallow cup or soak a clean cloth with it fill the shallow cup just enough to submerge the area you want to treat such as a finger wound or soak a clean cloth completely to dab over a larger area such as a leg or an arm 5 x research source apply the soak to the affected area 2 to 3 times a day until it heals you should expose the affected area to the soak for about 5 to 10 minutes either by dipping the area in a shallow cup of the solution or dabbing the area with a soaked cloth 6 x research source a good rule of thumb is to do it once in the morning once around lunch and once before you go to sleep this

fruits and veggies at certain times of the year as an added bonus when things are in season they taste better 1 x research source in fall look for produce like pumpkins winter squash cabbage and apples in the winter opt for winter squash cabbage and other root vegetables springtime is great for produce like beets leafy greens spring onions and asparagus summer is a good time for watermelon

though be sure to pick ones that don t have added sugar or salt 2 x research source check your proteins too frozen chicken may be cheaper than fresh and canned salmon and tuna is likely cheaper than fresh fish 3 x research source check out the weekly deals most grocery stores run weekly specials which you can learn about through their weekly ads when something is on sale that s the time to stock up on it most protein can be frozen and saved for later for instance so if your store is running a sale on boneless skinless chicken breasts buy some to use and save for later 4 x trustworthy source

you ll make up for it in flavor some farmer s markets even accept snap choose cheaper ingredients not all healthy ingredients are expensive in fact many healthy ingredients are cheap take each category of food you need to buy and figure out options in each one for instance in whole grains you can try oatmeal brown rice bulgur popcorn and whole wheat bread and pasta for vegetables pick ones

contains the most fiber but it takes longer to cook about 3 hours than semi pearled or pearled farro it can be rougher on sensitive digestive systems and has an earthier nuttier flavor than the more processed versions semi pearled farro cooks in about half the time as whole grain farro because the bran has been scored allowing heat to reach the center more quickly it has less nutrition than whole grain farro however pearled farro has had its bran completely removed it is the quickest yet least nutritious form to consume soak the farro if desired soaking is not necessary for semi pearled and pearled farro but it can greatly reduce the overall cooking time for whole farro place the farro in a bowl and cover it with cool water for 8 to 16 hours in the refrigerator 2 x research source rinse

how to make ginger paste,fresh ginger is an essential ingredient in many recipes but you may get tired of peeling and grating small amounts of ginger over and over instead you can chop up a much larger amount of ginger puree it into a paste and store it in the fridge or freezer for use as needed in recipes once you have fresh ginger ready to go you ll be using it in everything from sushi to ice cream to cocktails,pick hands of ginger that are firm and have smooth skin you ll find ginger at the market in oddly shaped pieces called hands the protruding sections are called fingers avoid hands that feel light for their size have wrinkly skin and are soft to the touch those ones have lost too much of their water content instead look for hands that have smooth brown skin and that feel both heavy for their size and firm to the touch 1 x research source most people call ginger a root but it s actually a rhizome store the ginger in the fridge until you re ready to use it wrap the ginger loosely in plastic wrap and place a rubber band over it or put it in a zip close bag with the zipper kept partly open stash it in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator for up to 1 week before using it 2 x research source the ginger will go bad more quickly if you seal it up tight even if the ginger hasn t gotten moldy or mushy after a week it will start to lose the brightness of its flavor quickly wash and peel the ginger if you re not using the whole hand cut or snap off a finger or two of the ginger rinse it under running water and rub off any dirt then dry it with paper towels peel off the skin with a vegetable peeler or a paring knife 3 x research source work carefully with the peeler or paring knife they re sharp if the ginger has thin smooth skin you don t necessarily have to peel it however peeling it may make your ginger paste come out a little bit smoother chop the ginger coarsely and measure out 1 c 225 g use a sharp knife to cut up the ginger the pieces don t have to be uniform in size but try to make them no more than 0 25 in 6 4 mm thick keep chopping until you have your desired amount 4 x research source if you ve cleaned and peeled too much ginger simply double the recipe to 2 c 450 g add 0 25 c 59 ml of water to a blender or food processor use room temperature or cold water you may need up to 0 5 c 120 ml to make a paste out of 1 c 225 g of chopped ginger so be ready to add more water as needed while you work 5 x research source adding the water first makes the pureeing go a little faster add the ginger and if desired oil or citric acid as a preservative if you want to ensure the full flavor profile of the ginger don t use anything but it and water to make your paste however the paste will last longer in the fridge or freezer if you add either 2 us tbsp 30 ml of vegetable oil or 1 tsp 5 g of citric acid 6 x research source you ll find citric acid in powdered form at health stores and many grocery stores these preservatives will extend the storage time in the fridge from about 1 week to 1 month and in the freezer from 1 month to 3 months you can add both vegetable oil and citric acid but this won t further extend the storage time puree the mixture until it forms a smooth paste depending on your blender or food processor you may need to occasionally scrape down the inside of the container with a silicone spatula to help fully incorporate the chunks of ginger you can also add up to 0 25 c 59 ml of additional water as needed to help break down the ginger pieces stop pureeing when the entire mixture has a consistent slightly lumpy texture 7 x research source in regards to consistency the mixture should look more like grits than oatmeal keep the puree in a tightly sealed container in the fridge or freezer immediately transfer your puree to one or more containers with tight fitting lids then stash it in the refrigerator or freezer without any added preservatives the paste will keep in the fridge for 1 week and in the freezer for 1 month 8 x research source if you added vegetable oil or citric acid to the paste it should keep for up to 1 month in the fridge and up to 3 months in the freezer use ice cube trays to freeze mini doses of paste instead if you consistently use the same amount of ginger paste in your go to recipes you can freeze pre measured amounts by using ice cube trays spoon your preferred amount up to 1 us tbsp 15 ml into each cup in an ice cube tray then freeze the paste solid after that pop out the ginger paste cubes and store them in a labeled zip close freezer bag 9 x

how to use healthy cooking methods,eating healthier meals is a big part of taking good care of yourself and your family but eating healthier doesn t mean you have to sacrifice flavor or eliminate your favorite foods learn how to cook your foods in a healthier way like by steaming your vegetables or broiling your meats similarly you can substitute some less nutritious ingredients for healthier alternatives like swapping out mayonnaise and using smashed avocado instead,boil your veggies and meats to cook them without using any oils or fats all you need to boil food is a large pot water and a little bit of salt carrots broccoli cauliflower potatoes chicken and beef are just a few options for ingredients you can boil check online for specific boiling times 1 x research source vegetables like carrots and broccoli generally take about 8 10 minutes to boil whereas potatoes will take a little bit longer about 15 minutes use a meat thermometer to check the interior temperature of meats to make sure they re cooked all the way through once you think the meat should be done remove it from the hot water with tongs and place it on a cutting board insert the meat thermometer and check the temperature chicken should be cooked to 165 f 74 c and beef should be cooked to 160 f 71 c if it isn t cooked yet add it back to the hot water for another couple of minutes boiling is a simpler way to cook and it s healthier than using lots of fats but it does also compromise the nutrients of the foods some veggies like brussels sprouts broccoli and sweet potatoes are water soluble which means they lose some nutrients when cooked in water steam your veggies and fish to keep all their nutrients intact you can place a steaming basket over a pot of boiling water or you could also wrap your ingredients in foil and place them in the steamer basket to contain all the juices simply bring a pot of water to a boil place your steam basket on top and add your ingredients to the basket 2 x research source the best ingredients to steam are veggies like green beans zucchini and asparagus fish fillets and shellfish also steam well in general the veggies and meats that take the least amount of time to cook are the best ones to steam veggies generally take about 15 20 minutes to steam whereas fish will take only about 6 15 minutes depending on how thick the fillet is check online for specific steaming times add a pinch of salt or some lemon juice to your steamed veggies or fish for some extra flavor grill your meats and veggies for a nice smoky flavor and less fat grilling is great because it makes your meat tender while also letting the fat drip away from it which is healthier for you it also imparts a nice flavor to meats and veggies you can grill steak and chicken as well as vegetables like asparagus peppers onions zucchini and even lettuce 3 x research source there are some studies that suggest the char from grilled foods is carcinogenic and shouldn t be eaten regularly to combat this try to grill leaner cuts of meat that have shorter cooking times or use a gas or electric grill if you can you can even grill fruits like peaches for a tasty addition to main meals and desserts stir fry your food for a quick flavorful option use a few teaspoons of a healthy cooking oil like extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil and add in your chopped veggies and protein for a 10 minute meal because the cooking time is so short there is less time for your ingredients to lose their healthy nutrients 4 x research source try stir frying mushrooms zucchini peppers onions and chicken for a tasty dinner option add a little bit of low sodium soy sauce and some garlic to the dish for some extra flavor your body does need some fats in order to function at its best so its okay to use heart healthy oils avoid using butter lard and sauces that are high in calories fat and sugar broil your meals in the oven for a fast way to cook broiling is a high heat option that doesn t require you to add any additional oils or fats to your dish use lean cuts of meat like chicken and fish and heartier vegetables like squash and onion make sure you preheat the broiler before putting your dish in the oven or broiler drawer 5 x research source meals take about 12 15 minutes to broil always check your meat with a meat thermometer before serving it the risk with broiling foods is that because of the high heat level the food can dry out quickly that s why it s a good idea to use thinner leaner cuts of meat so that they won t take as long to cook microwave your food so it retains its nutrients while cooking quickly a microwave with a carousel that rotates the food is the best kind to use make sure you put your food into microwave safe dishes use a flat plate to cover the dishes when you microwave them to keep the food moist check online for cooking times for different ingredients 6 x research source there are some myths out there about microwaving but you don t need to worry about losing nutrients through microwaving veggies or about unhealthy radiation microwaves use electromagnetic radiation which is different from that kind of radiation that causes cancer potatoes take about 15 minutes to cook in the microwave whereas broccoli takes about 6 minutes if you cook meat in the microwave make sure to check the internal temperature before you eat it microwaving is a fast healthy option it essentially steams the food so keep in mind that you won t get any of the flavor that you might from grilling or stir frying try adding some seasonings to your food like salt pepper or lemon juice try eating raw foods to avoid losing any nutrients through cooking focus on eating uncooked and unprocessed foods like fruits vegetables nuts seeds and pasteurized dairy products 7 x research source eating only raw foods isn t recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or who plan on becoming pregnant check with your doctor if you have concerns about your daily food intake choose whole wheat flour or grains when you cook breads pastas and rices all have whole wheat options available and they can usually be found at your local grocery store these options contain more fiber and they take longer to digest so they keep you full for longer 8 x research source check out other healthy grain substitutes like quinoa couscous and barley these options generally have more fiber fewer calories and are denser grains which means you ll be fuller for longer if you are gluten free try cauliflower rice or making pasta out of spiralized veggies use greek yogurt instead of sour cream for a heart healthy substitute purchase plain greek yogurt and use it in place of sour cream whether you are using it as a component of an actual recipe or just as a topping to a dish like baked potatoes or tacos 9 x research source greek yogurt has fewer calories and grams of fat than sour cream and the texture and taste are very similar smash up an avocado to use in place of mayonnaise or cheese if you re looking for a creamy alternative when making sandwiches wraps or tuna salad try cutting open an avocado and mashing the fruit to use lieu of mayo or cheese 10 x research source avocado has a similar texture to mayonnaise and while avocado is still high in fat it has tons of other vitamins minerals and fiber choose evoo over butter and explore

how to extract flavor,flavor extracts are a great way to add tang zest or sweetness to a recipe or a drink flavor extracts from the supermarket can have a lot of added sugar or corn syrup which can make them unhealthy you can make your own flavor extracts at home by using a few simple ingredients and leaving them to infuse for about 6 weeks,peel or cut open the ingredients you want to flavor the extract with you can extract flavor from a variety of fruits vegetables and herbs choose whichever ingredient that you d like to use and chop it up or peel it to expose the flavor inside make sure you have enough of your ingredient to fill an 8 fl oz 240 ml jar 1 x research source to make vanilla extract slice open 4 vanilla bean pods for almond extract cut up 1 2 cup 125 g of raw unsalted almonds to make lemon extract cut the rind off 2 lemons and then slice them into slivers to make orange extract cut the rind off 1 large orange and slice it into slivers for mint extract gather 1 cup 200 g of mint leaves you don t need to cut them up for coconut extract chop up 1 2 cup 125 g of coconut meat to make cinnamon extract just gather 4 sticks of whole cinnamon put the raw ingredients into an 8 fl oz 240 ml jar pick a jar that you can seal with a lid to make airtight amber jars are better than clear glass jars because they will keep your extract fresh for longer pour your raw ingredients into the jar making sure they don t overflow at the top of the lid 2 x research source if you are making vanilla extract put the whole vanilla bean pods into the jar for everything else use your chopped raw ingredients fill the jar with 40 alcohol vodka pick out a high quality vodka so that your extract tastes pure use a funnel to fill the bottle with vodka leaving a 0 5 in 1 3 cm gap between the rim of the bottle and the top of the vodka 3 x research source the higher quality vodka you use the better your extract will taste you can use bourbon instead of vodka if you d like to seal the jar with an airtight lid make sure the lid is on tight so that no air can get inside if your lid isn t quite airtight try adding a layer of plastic wrap underneath it 5 x research source most glass jars come with lids so you can seal them tightly shake the jar gently every 2 to 3 days pick up your jar and turn it upside down a few times try to do this every couple of days so that your vodka gets totally infused with the flavor 6 x research source shaking the ingredients around will help the flavor disperse more let the extract sit for 6 weeks before you use it keep your jar of flavor extract on a shelf in your kitchen for at least 6 weeks before you use it in any recipes it will take this long for the flavor to fully infuse the vodka 7 x research source if you use the extract too early it could end up tasting like vodka strain the raw ingredients with a strainer when you re ready to use your flavor extract set up a strainer and pour the liquid into a new glass jar you can throw away the raw ingredients and just use the liquid as your extract 8 x research source you don t have to strain your raw ingredients if you don t want to but it will make your extract easier to use store the extract in a cool dry place until you use it all since flavor extract is made primarily with vodka it will store in your kitchen cabinet for years to come try not to store it in direct sunlight and make sure it doesn t get too cold in the winter so that it stays fresh 9 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

how to store chewing gum,buying chewing gum in bulk can save you money but only if you store it properly so it remains chewy and flavorful fortunately packaged chewing gum stays fresh for several months if not longer when kept in a cool dry dark place however if you happened to invest in some chewing gum art or made some of your own be warned that it s really difficult to permanently preserve used chewing gum 1 x research source,keep the gum in its original packaging gum is packaged to maintain freshness so it makes sense to keep it that way until you re ready to chew it if your gum package is sealed in a plastic overwrap keep the overwrap in place until it s time to grab a piece of gum from the package 2 x research source gum comes packaged many different ways from plastic bags to metal tins to paper cartons to name just a few however your favorite gum is packaged leave it as is as much as possible seal your gum packages in one or more airtight containers if the gum package is already sealed up in a plastic overwrap this step is probably overkill however if you ve already opened the gum package storing it in a jar or other airtight container can help keep your gum fresh and flavorful 3 x research source keeping different flavors of gum in the same sealed container may cause the flavors to mingle in unpleasant ways if you like both cinnamon and spearmint gum for instance you should probably store them separately stick the gum in a cool dry dark place most types of gum start to soften at around 80 f 27 c and get really soft in environments above about 95 f 35 c like in your mouth for the best results aim for these storage conditions a temperature between about 50 75 f 10 24 c average indoor humidity around 50 and cover from direct sunlight 4 x research source a pantry cupboard or coat closet can make a good storage spot for gum bad storage choices include a jar on the windowsill or a kitchen cupboard right up against the oven don t store gum in the fridge or freezer cool is good for gum storage but cold may cause more harm than good gum that has been stored in a refrigerator or especially a freezer usually becomes brittle and difficult to chew gums that are encased in hard shells may fare a bit better than stick gums but room temperature storage is usually superior in all cases your freezer is however very useful in helping to remove gum from fabrics chew the gum within 8 10 months for the best flavor and texture the sooner you open a pack of gum the softer chewier and more flavorful it will be that said even a gum connoisseur is unlikely to notice much difference between a newly bought stick of gum and one that s been properly stored for 6 months in general you won t notice any difference in quality for at least 8 10 months after purchase 5 x research source throw out the gum if it looks or smells bad you re unlikely to come across moldy or rotten chewing gum but it s possible in some cases trust your senses before putting any questionable piece of gum in your mouth if you see splotches or discolorations or smell any off odors toss the entire package of gum in the trash 6 x research source if the gum looks and smells okay but has an off taste once you put it in your mouth spit it out and get rid of the whole pack it s much more likely that the gum in an old package will become dry brittle and unpleasant to chew while you can try to soften it up with some assertive chewing buying new gum is probably your best bet don t toss out gum just because it s past its best by date remember that chewing gum rarely goes bad in the sense that it might cause you harm generally its quality just goes downhill over time the best by date is only an estimate by the manufacturer about when this decline in quality will happen if the gum still looks and tastes fine go ahead and chew it 7 x research source some gums may be perfectly fine for months after the best by date while others may decline in quality shortly afterward but even as the quality fades it s extremely unlikely that the gum will become a possible source of foodborne illness store nicotine gum according to its specific instructions the storage instructions for chewing gum and prescription medications are similar in several respects it s usually best to store them in a cool dry dark place not surprisingly then this is the general storage advice for medicated nicotine gums used for smoking cessation always follow the specific storage instructions on the package though 8 x research source the package may give you a maximum temperature for example 77 f 25 c at which to store the gum storing the gum improperly may impact the potency and effectiveness of the medication keep your gum in a purse or bag instead of your pocket while it s convenient to stash a pack of gum in your pants pocket your body heat may cause the gum to become overly soft sticky and deformed in some cases the softened gum may ooze out of the packaging and get stuck to the inside of your pocket 9 x research source a shirt pocket is a slightly better choice than a pants pocket but it s still possible that your body heat may make the gum soft and sticky generally speaking try to keep packaged gum at or below 80 f 27 c store gum in a shady spot in your vehicle during hot weather a sunny location in your vehicle can easily reach 130 f 54 c or higher on a summer day which is plenty hot enough to turn your gum into sticky goo keeping your gum in a shady location like the glove box or center console is more likely to keep it under about 90 f 32 c 10 x research source alternatively during the winter the temperature inside your car may fall below 32 f 0 c and cause your packaged gum to turn brittle and unpleasant to chew so you may just want to keep your gum package with you instead of leaving it in the car save the gum wrapper for disposal or short term storage if you need to remove a piece of gum from your mouth the most sanitary option is to spit it out into its wrapper wrap it up and throw it in the trash if you really want to put the gum back into your mouth after you take a drink or make a phone call it will probably stay soft in the wrapper for a good 5 minutes but why not just chew a new piece of gum instead don t stick your used gum on the wall under a desk or anywhere else but the trash that s unsanitary and just plain gross and assuming that you don t like stepping in gum yourself don t throw your own used gum on the ground see if gum recycling is available in your area some cities have run trials that involve setting up gum recycling boxes for used chewing gum if this is happening where you live go ahead and put your unwrapped used gum in the marked box instead of in the trash 11 x research source don t worry recycling doesn t mean that your old chewing gum is turned into new chewing gum instead the used gum and the recycling box are turned into a plastic product that can be molded to shape for various uses,Food-and-Entertaining

how to use leftovers,leftovers have a somewhat bad reputation but with a little creativity you can transform most of your old leftovers into new flavorful dishes that anyone would be happy to eat effectively using your leftovers can also save money on your grocery bill make sure that any leftovers you choose to consume are handled safely to prevent possible food poisoning though,store leftover food quickly the sooner you refrigerate or freeze your leftovers the long they ll last and the safer they ll be as a general rule you should plan on refrigerating your leftovers within two hours after they finish cooking in particularly hot weather shorten this amount of time to one hour 1 x research source if you plan on refrigerating your leftovers you should allow them to cool down in the refrigerator rather than cooling them at room temperature on the other hand if you plan to freeze your leftovers give them time to cool at room temperature before transferring them to the freezer 2 x trustworthy source national health service uk public healthcare system of the uk go to source keep food in airtight containers ideally the food should be stored in shallow plastic containers or freezer safe plastic bags any container you use should also have an airtight lid food cools more rapidly in shallow containers than it can in deep containers making it safer to consume later air can cause leftovers to spoil more quickly but the use of an airtight lid or seal will keep food fresher for longer separating the food into smaller containers will also make it safer to reheat since most food should only be reheated once leave enough space in the refrigerator packing too many containers of food into a small space can prevent cool air from circulating properly and cause the food to spoil faster 3 x research source your leftovers should remain at a temperature between 35 and 40 degrees fahrenheit 1 7 to 4 4 degrees celsius it s a good idea to periodically check the inside temperature of your refrigerator to make sure that it runs within this range discard unsafe leftovers most properly refrigerated leftovers will remain safe for two to five days but any leftover you re suspicious about should be thrown out instead of reused do a sniff test on all leftover food you plan to use open the container and smell the food inside if the odor is unusual throw it away you should also inspect the food for mold or other visible signs of decay store properly most meats can be stored in the refrigerator for two to three days 4 x research source place the meat in an airtight food safe container or bag before refrigerating it whole cooked poultry pork and beef can be stored for two days but ground meats usually last for three days most cooked meat can also be frozen place the meat in freezer safe plastic bags label the bag with the current date and freeze until ready to use poultry and ground meats usually stay safe for three months but red meat should be used within one month cooked fish should not be refrozen reheat thoroughly meat can usually be reheated in the microwave in the oven or on the stove you should only reheat meat once however and it must be reheated to in internal temperature of 165 degrees fahrenheit 74 degrees celsius red meat poultry pork and ground meats usually reheat without a problem no matter which method you use seafood has a tendency to dry out when reheated at high temperatures however so it s best to avoid the microwave and use the oven use a low temperature and reheat the fish for 15 minutes or so add diced meat to one dish meals cooked meat poultry and fish can usually be cut into bite sized pieces and added to stir fries casseroles and similar one dish meals these dishes are also a good way to use leftover grains and vegetables hot one dish meals worth considering include stir fries risottos curries casseroles pot pies and soups alternatively you can cut up cold meat and toss it into a salad cut or shred meat for sandwiches large portions of leftover meat can be cut into slices or shredded you can then pile it between two pieces of bread and enjoy it as a sandwich this works especially well with leftover roasts whole turkeys whole chickens and meatloaf but it may also work with smaller portions of meat and poultry if standard sandwich bread isn t sturdy enough you may need to use buns or toasted bread bulk up sauces ground meats and flaked fish can be added to sauces used for pasta and other meals mix the meat into any standard pasta sauce to make it heartier another creative option would be to mix the meat into other gravies and sauces used for vegetables chili bases and soup bases store for several days cooked grains starches and baked goods should usually be placed in airtight containers and stored in the refrigerator for up to five days even though all leftovers should be kept in airtight containers it is especially important to keep leftover cake bread and other baked goods well sealed consider wrapping bakery in cling wrap before placing it into an airtight bag or container bakery can also be frozen for up to three months reheat grains carefully many leftover grains and starches have a tendency to dry out when reheated especially when done at a high heat if you plan on microwaving rice quinoa or other grains sprinkle the grains with water before doing so the microwave will dry out the extra water you just added before going after the moisture contained in the grains when using leftover grains pasta and potatoes with a sauce or other liquid consider mixing the sauce and grain first before reheating it in most instances it should be safe to reheat the saucy grain starch on the stove or in the microwave add grains to dough cooked cereals can enhance bread doughs and muffin doughs 5 x research source you can make multigrain breads by grinding down the grains and kneading them evenly into the dough alternatively you can sprinkle the grains over the bread dough immediately before baking it to create a healthy and crunchy topping toss leftover grains and starches into one dish meals cooked grains pastas and potatoes can easily be combined with meats and vegetables to create one pot or one dish meals nearly any leftover starch or grain can be mixed into casseroles and soups leftover rice and quinoa can be used as filling for tortillas rice can also be fried with various vegetables and enjoyed as fried rice and both rice and pasta can be used in stir fries toast breads leftover bread that s starting to go stale can be toasted and used dry just make sure that no mold has started to develop before using it bake leftover bread in the oven at a low temperature keeping it there just long enough for the bread to become crispy but not burnt you can sprinkle the bread with butter and garlic to create makeshift garlic bread or butter and cinnamon sugar for a simple snack plain toasted bread can be cut into cubes and used as croutons crumble dry baked goods baked goods that are dry and beyond saving can be crushed into crumbs or crumbled and reassembled accordingly dry bread can be turned into breadcrumbs and these crumbs can be used as breading or filler for fresh meat dishes crumbled cake can be mixed with buttercream to create cake pops similarly crumbled bread can be used for bread pudding or french toast casseroles store for several days most cooked vegetables and fruits can be stored in the refrigerator for four to five days even if a particular vegetable or fruit was stored at room temperature before you cooked it you should store leftovers in the refrigerator after they ve been cooked most cooked produce tends to get soggy when frozen and thawed so refrigerator your produce leftovers will be a better option reheat or use cold most leftover produce can be reused either chilled or warmed the best option will depend upon the specific way you reuse it fruit tends to be delicate so most fruits will fall apart once they re reheated vegetables are much easier to reheat the microwave is the easiest option but you can also reheat them in the oven or on the stove mash or blend most produce use a vegetable masher or blender to liquify your leftover vegetables then use the end product to enhance other liquid based dishes blended vegetables can be added to soup stock chip dip hummus or chili blended fruits can be added to fruit based sauces and smoothies use vegetables in one dish meals consider adding your leftover vegetables to warm and cold one dish meals warm dishes include casseroles stir fries soups pizza and omelets since the vegetables have already been cooked add them to the dish during the last few minutes of cooking so that they can be reheated without becoming soggy you can also add many cold vegetables to salads add fruit to desserts fruit based leftovers can be used to enhance otherwise simple desserts for instance you can gently reheat the fruit and spread it over pound cake or ice cream some fruits can also be added directly to the batter of cakes muffins cookies breads or other baked goods prior to baking use stored sauces quickly all leftover sauces should be stored in shallow airtight containers and kept in the refrigerator homemade sauces should usually be used within two or three days if the sauce contains meat or came into contact with meat it is especially important to use it within the two to three day time limit commercially prepared sauces should be kept according to label instructions in most cases you ll need to use the sauce within one to two weeks after opening the container any commercial sauce actually used as part of another dish should be treated as a homemade sauce and used within three to four days reheat thoroughly and with caution most sauces can be reheated on the stove or in your microwave make sure that the sauce is reheated thoroughly either way stir the sauce to distribute the heat evenly if you don t do this some parts may remain cold while others could become too hot also note that some sauces are easier to reheat than others sauces and gravies thickened with cornstarch or flour may become lumpy when reheated in the microwave so when possible consider reheating these sauces on the stove enhance other foods with leftover sauce sauces and gravies contain a range of ingredients so mixing them into another dish can add a lot of flavor consider mixing the sauce into other liquid based dishes like soups and chilies you can also add the sauce to otherwise dry ingredients for instance leftover gravy can be treated as a condiment for sandwiches leftover sauces can be tossed with plain rice or pasta for a simple side dish blend sauces if you re feeling bold mix together two separate sauces to create something entirely new you can then add this new sauce to foods in the same way you d use the old sauces experiment with different combinations that seem appealing to you you might blend together a cheese based sauce with a tomato based sauce or try blending together a cream sauce with a hot sauce when you do experiment you may want to taste test the newly created sauce before adding it to other food just in case you re not satisfied with the results reinvent the sauce another way to transform an old sauce into something new would be to enhance it with new seasonings

touch try to clean up as much as you can before your partner arrives once you have finished cooking and everything is being kept warm or is already plated try to wash up the dishes and kitchen as much as possible if you don t have time fill the sink with hot water after the scraping the plates and put the dishes in so that they will be easy to clean the next day set the table generally you will

how to choose a green coconut,green coconuts are picked when they re around 7 months old and contain more water than mature coconuts if you want to try one for yourself check your local supermarket to see if they have some fresh coconuts while the main part of the coconut usually stays protected by the husk you should still check it for any damage or mold once you find the right coconut you can easily open it at home and enjoy the sweet water and meat,select a coconut with the least number of brown patches on the husk pick up the coconut and turn it in your hands to inspect the husk try to find one that has a consistent green color without any damage or discoloration if you can t find one without brown spots choose the one with the least discoloration since it will usually be fresher 1 x research source avoid coconuts if they have a thick brown husk since they are the most mature and won t contain as much water look for a coconut that s round rather than oblong coconuts start off small and round when they begin growing and get more oblong as they mature compare the shapes of the coconuts visually and avoid any that have an elongated shape while you usually won t find one that s perfectly round choose the next closest one 2 x research source round coconuts tend to carry more water than oblong ones avoid coconuts that make a sound when you shake them hold the coconut up to your ear and shake it vigorously if you have a young green coconut it shouldn t make any noise since it s filled with water if you hear liquid sloshing around then the coconut may be too mature or it could be cracked and leaking 3 x research source the coconut will feel heavy for its size due to the water if you pick up the coconut and it s very light the water may have leaked out check the top and bottom of the coconut for mold find the stem or the flat part on top of the coconut and press on it to feel for any soft spots or mold then flip the coconut over and look for any black spots on the bottom hold the coconut up to your nose and avoid buying it if it has a musty moldy odor 4 x research source even if there s mold on the husk the bacteria can absorb into the coconut and contaminate the water and meat see if there are pre husked coconuts so they re easier to open many grocery stores carry green coconuts with the husk already removed so you don t have to cut it off later look for white coconuts with pointed tops and flat bottoms individually wrapped in plastic avoid any pre husked coconuts that have any discoloration or mold growing on them 5 x research source you will usually find the pre husked coconuts near the mature coconuts in the produce aisle poke a coconut opener through the top if you only want to drink the water a coconut opener has a round hole that punches straight through the coconut husk so you can drain the water place the coconut upright so the stem faces up set the coconut opener in the middle of the stem and forcefully press down to push it into the coconut twist and pull the opener back out so you can drink the water out from the hole 6 x research source you can buy a coconut opener online or from a kitchen specialty store coconut water may spray and spill out when you punch through the coconut so don t be surprised if it splashes on you lay the coconut horizontal so the stem points to your dominant hand set the coconut on your cutting board so it s on its side and hold it in place with your non dominant hand make sure you position the stem on the same side as your dominant hand so it s easier to cut without hurting yourself 7 x research source avoid cutting from the bottom of the husk since it s usually thicker and more difficult to work your knife through cut wedge shaped slices off the coconut husk until you reach the inner shell hold a cleaver in your dominant hand position the blade at a 45 degree angle just below the stem so you re cutting away from your body cut through the husk to remove a wedge shaped from the stem move your knife over by about 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm and cut off another piece angling the blade toward the stem continue working through your coconut until you see a darker brown or green inner shell which is the part of the coconut with water and meat 8 x research source don t let the coconut roll around freely on your cutting board since your knife will be more likely to slip turn the coconut so the cut side faces up as soon as you expose the inner shell stop cutting the husk since the water will spill out reposition the coconut so it s upright before moving on 9 x research source strike the edge of the inner shell with the heel of your knife to break it open position the heel or the bottom corner of the blade so it s at a 45 degree angle to the top of the coconut hold the opposite side of the coconut with your other hand so it doesn t move around hit the coconut at an angle with enough force for the blade s heel to pierce through the shell rock the blade back and forth to peel the top part of the shell off of the coconut 10 x research source your coconut may be filled to the top with water so do your best not to spill be extremely careful when striking your coconut you don t need to use a lot of force to break through the shell pour the water out from the coconut keep a glass or bowl nearby so you can pour out the water quickly turn the coconut over and let all of the water drain out so you can get to the meat enjoy the coconut water while it s fresh for a sweet healthy drink 11 x research source you can also drink the water directly from the coconut if you don t want to get a dish dirty scoop the coconut meat out with a spoon while you usually need to grate mature coconut meat you can eat directly from a green coconut with a spoon stick a spoon inside your coconut and scrape around the edges to remove the meat enjoy the meat on its own for a sweet and nutritious snack or mix it into smoothies for an added boost of flavor 12 x research source green coconuts don t have as much meat as a mature coconut,Food-and-Entertaining

you can make the night before or that can be prepped a day or two before and then thrown in the oven when guests arrive for example let s say you re throwing a formal dinner party you can start marinading a roast overnight setting it to soak in juices and stuffing it with garlic prep mashed potatoes the night before that only need to be reheated when guests arrive supplement all of this with a salad that s easy to toss together this way all you have to do on the night of the party is toss together the salad and put the roast in the over about two hours before guests are ready to eat make

of ice for displaying fruit punch set out the food once everything is prepared you can start setting out your food for formal parties everyone might be sitting down around a large table for less formal parties it s better to have food on a table somewhere slightly out of the way just be sure that you re not setting out food that can spoil too early cold or hot foods should wait until guests arrive to be displayed putting food on multiple levels or tiers can make it easier to reach all of the food items just don t put things toward the back which are easy to drop you don t want cocktail sauce too fall into the fruit salad if your guests will not be sitting to eat try to choose foods which are easy to eat while standing up some foods like soup can pose too much of a challenge welcome people to your home when people come in you ll want to start by welcoming them to your home don t just ignore them or rush off to talk to someone else even if the party is informal this can leave your guest feeling unwelcome and neglected even just saying something simple like aw i m so happy you came make yourself at home can be enough show them around if you have the time to show them around the areas where the party is happening they don t need a tour of your knickknacks but pointing out where the bathroom is and where they can find the food is useful you also might want to tell them where they can put things what some of the basic house rules are such as if shoes aren t allowed in a room and so on introduce people to each other a good host will introduce people that don t know each other and try to help them communicate with each other you want to get a conversation started before you move on to talk to other people 6 x research source for example if you know two people both like the same musician you can say something like oh becca you ll appreciate this julie just got back from a macklemore show in seattle julie becca is just obsessed with macklemore make everyone feel included as the party goes on try to talk to and interact with everyone you probably will have a few people that you re closer with than others and you might be tempted to just talk to them all night but that can leave other guests feeling left out try to at least check on everyone every now and again even if it s just to offer them more to drink try to ask at least one question of each guest over the course of the party this shows them that you take an interest in them and that you care about their presence send them off at the end of the party once the party wraps up say goodbye to people as they leave and thank them for coming this makes people feel appreciated and respected neglecting to say goodbye can hurt people s feelings and ruin their perception of your party even if they had an otherwise good time find ways for people to have fun together of course it s a party so you ll want to be sure to set up activities to keep people talking and interacting you ll want to tailor those activities however to the number of guests you ll have as well as the interests and personalities of your guests create large group activities if you have lots of people you ll want to have at least one activity that lots of people can do together 7 x research source try a cheesy dance competition rent a karaoke machine and hire someone to come and give your group dance lessons of course the activity you choose should take your guests into account if they re quiet ladies for example someone to give a lesson on decoupage might be better appreciated than a dance instructor create small

monopoly either newer games like apples to apples are great for small party groups around 10 players create space for introverts remember that not all of your guests will be extroverted just because they re at a party by giving introverts a quiet place to escape for a few minutes you can make sure that everyone enjoys your party but of course you also want to give them the tools they need be social comfortably try creating conversation starter cards these cards have a couple of questions or conversation topics written out on them place these cards at their place setting or on a table in the middle of the room so people can use them when they want to mix outdoor and indoor activities as needed if your party will outside you ll need outdoor activities if your party is indoors you ll need indoor activities having both available might be a good idea too just remember that if you re planning an outdoor party and environmental factors might ruin your plans like rain you ll want to

how to cook healthily,the most difficult aspect of cooking healthily today is sorting through all of the conflicting information about nutrition that bombards us healthy cooking is an important decision that will prevent many chronic illnesses and dysfunctions as well as keep you feeling and looking your best the keys to healthy cooking include getting back to whole foods using fresh ingredients and choosing the right proportions of healthy foods like fruits and vegetables,use fresh local fruit that is in season cook with citrus in the spring berries in summer and apples and pumpkin in the fall food prepared at the peak of its freshness has unbeatable flavor and nutritional value avoid adding table sugar to fruit dishes instead choose healthy ways to enhance the flavor of fruit in your cooking for example serve baked apples with frozen yogurt cinnamon walnuts and dried cranberries or add balsamic vinegar to strawberries to bring out their natural sweetness don t forget juices and dried fruits fruit juice and dried fruit when used in moderation is a healthy addition to many meals cook a dish like moroccan chicken with dried plums to boost the fiber content of the dish or use freshly squeezed orange juice to give a citrus kick to a salad dressing use fruit purees in place of fat when baking applesauce is a great substitute for vegetable oil in muffin and bread recipes you ll have to do some research to calculate just how much fat you can replace with fruit in your recipes but the fruit can add the same moisture to your dishes without making your fingers greasy so it s worth it buy fresh vegetables in season asparagus spinach and scallions are best in the spring many vegetables like tomatoes squash and swiss chard are good in the summer root vegetables like acorn or butternut squash bring warmth to any autumn table and if you live in a warm climate you can explore options of cultivating your own vegetable gardens to get the most selection based on your tastes choose healthy cooking methods when you prepare vegetables burying vegetables in butter preparing them with animal fat or dousing them in oil adds many extra calories without adding nutritional value try steaming or roasting with a little bit of olive oil for nutritious and delicious preparations even though too much fat is not beneficial adding some plant based fats like olive or walnut oil to your deep greens like leafy greens broccoli and brussels sprouts actually helps your body absorb more of their nutrients don t forget frozen as an option freezing vegetables in season and storing them for future use is an easy way to get the flavor of the harvest all year round for quick dishes choose frozen pre chopped organic vegetables from your grocery store avoid refined carbohydrates for example choose to replace white bread with whole wheat or rye also whole wheat pastas have improved greatly in quality since they were first introduced to the market cook creatively with whole grains for instance add barley to beef stew or make a whole grain pilaf with sliced almonds and dried fruit try something new learn to cook with quinoa spelt or couscous so that you can have a break from rice and pasta choose proteins high in omega 3 fatty acids foods like salmon and omega 3 enriched eggs are great sources of omega 3 fatty acids these nutrients promote healthy brain function as well as cardiovascular health remember non meat sources of protein you can eat servings of protein that are lower in calories and higher in fiber by choosing proteins like beans or tofu chop up some tofu and add it to soup or serve bean and cheese enchiladas with a side of rice in place of meat enchiladas watch your portion size a good rule of thumb is to remember that a serving size of protein is about the size of a deck of cards generally a piece of meat or other protein should be no larger or thicker than your palm learn to cook with low fat dairy options in many recipes heavy cream or whole milk can be replaced with low fat or skim milk be careful when baking to stick to reduced fat dairy rather than fat free dairy become more versatile with yogurt yogurt is delicious eaten out of the container but plain yogurt can also be served in soups or used as a marinade for meats salmon served with a lemon and dill yogurt sauce for example makes a nutrient packed and elegant meal look to food from middle eastern and indian cultures to inspire you to find more ways to use yogurt in your cooking focus on flavor instead of quantity when cooking with cheese if you purchase a high quality flavorful cheese then you can use less cheese and still add flavor to your cooking grate pecorino on top off a pizza and cut down on the mozzarella or sprinkle a little bit of gorgonzola on a salad instead of heaps of mild cheddar choose oils and fatty foods that are low in saturated fat olive oil and canola oil are the healthiest oils that you can use in your cooking other nut and seed oils also make healthy choices prepare fatty fish like salmon or mackerel instead of beef avocados are also an excellent source of healthy fats avoid trans fats trans fats are found in foods that have been hydrogenated so that they can maintain shelf stability at room temperature these fats are universally understood to be bad for your health and they hide in places you might not expect before you roll a piece of chicken in bread crumbs check the package to make sure that the crumbs don t contain trans fats also avoid margarine and shortening in your cooking whenever possible remember that quality can lower quantity investing in an excellent olive oil for cooking allows you to put more flavor in your food even while using less oil another idea is to choose a creamy european butter the intense flavor will allow you to cut the butter content in your cooking by at least one third,Food-and-Entertaining

how to measure olive oil spray,if you are trying to bulk up or watching your weight you re probably very meticulous about how many calories you eat in a day measuring olive oil spray can be tough since you can t pour it into a measuring cup fortunately by checking the nutrition label on your can of spray you can figure out how many calories you are adding to your meal,remove the lid and put the spray can on a scale for a base weight set up a small kitchen scale and make sure it is set to 0 take the lid off your can of olive oil spray and wait for your scale to measure it most serving sizes are in grams g so set your scale to that if you can 1 x research source take the can off the scale and spray the oil once for about 1 second hold the can of oil upright and away from your face press the nozzle down just slightly and let it spray out for about 1 second try to spray as accurately as possible so that you can gauge an accurate measurement 2 x research source if you are worried about accurately timing yourself you can set a timer on your phone or your computer for 1 second weigh the can on the scale again keeping the lid off set your kitchen scale to 0 and then place your olive oil spray back onto it wait for it to give you a measurement to see how much oil you sprayed out of the can 3 x research source subtract the second weight from the first one to get your measurement whatever your total is will tell you how much olive oil is in a single spray then you can calculate how many calories are in 1 spray of oil 4 x research source for example if your olive oil spray weighed 100 g the first time and it now weighs 85 g subtract 85 from 100 to get 15 g if you sprayed your olive oil 2 times divide your sum by 2 to get a measurement for 1 spray check the nutrition label on the can for a serving size and calorie count on the back of the can of olive oil check for the label that says nutrition facts look for the serving size at the very top of the label to see how many calories are in 1 serving size 5 x research source if you d like to calculate the total fat you are eating through olive oil spray check out the nutrition label for the number as well most olive oil sprays have 0 25 grams of fat per 1 4 of a second spray even if they say they re fat free 6 x research source multiply the calories by the number of sprays you use typical serving sizes for olive oil spray only last 1 4 of a second however spraying olive oil for 1 4 of a second is super hard and you ll probably spray it for at least 1 second take note of how many times you spray your olive oil then use that number to calculate how many calories you are eating 7 x research source for example if you sprayed your olive oil for 3 seconds and it has 2 4 calories in each 1 4 of a second spray add up the amount of 1 4 sprays are in each second 4 then multiply 3 seconds x 4 to get 12 finally multiply 12 x 2 4 to get 28 8 calories in a 3 second spray some fitness tracker apps and websites will do this calculation for you but it s always good to double check yourself if you are calculating total fat take your total number of 1 4 second sprays in this case 12 and multiply it by 0 25 to get 3 grams of fat for a 3 second spray of olive oil try to spray oil for less than 5 seconds at a time to cut back on calories since the amount of calories can quickly add up you should try to be cautious when you use olive oil spray hold your can about 6 inches 15 cm away from the surface you re spraying and count the seconds in your head as you spray 8 x research source if you spray your olive oil for about 5 seconds at a time you are consuming more calories than 1 tablespoon 15 ml of canola oil 41 calories multiply 5 seconds x 4 for the amount of 1 4 sprays in 5 seconds then multiply 20 x 2 4 to get 48 calories avoid spraying a lot of oil by spreading it with a paper towel instead of holding your spray nozzle down for 4 to 5 seconds try spraying the oil once in the center of your pan or baking sheet then use a paper towel to spread the oil out and coat the edges and the sides 9 x research source this will cut back on calories without having to give up olive oil spray,Food-and-Entertaining

how to use acorns for food,like many other true nuts acorns are an excellent source of food and they provided people with a wealth of health and food recipe ideas in earlier times today they re still in fashion as a food and rightly so because they re filled with b vitamins protein little fat and they re a decent complex carbohydrate and are good for controlling blood sugar levels 1 x research source every species of acorn is edible but some taste better than others however it is very important you do not eat them raw in order to not eat acorns that are bitter tasting and toxic you ll need to process them first here are directions and some suggestions about how to use acorns as food,gather your ripe acorns look for and only use brown acorns as these are ripe green acorns are unripe and are unsuitable for eating but mature green acorns can ripen in a clean dry place avoid any acorns that appear mildewed dusty blackened etc quality nutmeat will be yellowish in colour 2 x research source unprocessed natural nuts of various kinds of oaks white oaks produce bland tasting acorns the best for harvesting are the swamp white oak oregon white oak and the burr oak 3 x research source generally these won t need leaching red oaks produce bitter tasting acorns the emory oak s acorns are mild enough to not require processing 4 x research source black oaks produce very bitter tasting acorns and need a lot of leaching to overcome this leach the acorns of tannins untreated raw acorns contain high concentrations of tannic acid causing their taste to be bitter and them to be toxic to humans if eaten in large quantities 5 x research source it is possible to remove the tannic acid by simply leaching it out of acorns in a pot of boiling water 6 x research source pouring out the hot water and having repeated changes of water continue doing this until the water does not turn brown after you have strained and replaced it another method for leaching place one tablespoon of baking soda into one litre of water leave the acorns to soak in the baking soda infused water for 12 15 hours a native american or rustic method is bagging the nuts and allowing them to soak in a clean flowing stream for a few days until no brown colored water is seen when checking their progress 7 x research source remove the acorns once leached and leave to simply dry or to make roasted nuts after drying as desired raw acorns can be stored for months without spoiling this dramatically increases their value being a process as needed food resource however they must be dry or otherwise they can get moldy and mildewed but only when leached are they ready to use make acorn coffee peel the ripe processed acorns divide the kernels place in an ovenproof dish and cover roast in a low heat oven to dry slowly once roasted light medium or dark grind the resulting mixture can be blended into commercial coffee or used on its own to make acorn coffee make acorn flour whole or sift to remove fiber to make a finer cake flour called acorn starch read how to make acorn flour for instructions use the flour to make breads muffins etc korean cooking is largely the only cuisine that features acorn starch some korean noodles and jellies are made of acorn starch as acorn starch is a favorite part of this cuisine many asian grocery markets sell it 8 x research source pickle the leached acorns in brine use an olive making recipe and substitute acorns for the olives to make a treat delicacy substitute roasted acorns for nuts and cooked legumes they can replace many legumes and other nuts such as chickpeas peanuts macadamias etc follow your usual recipe and substitute acorn pieces instead like most nuts they are a nutritious dense food to use freely make acorn dukkah a dry spicy mixed dip which has many uses but is mainly used to dip bread that has been basted with olive oil or butter sprinkle chopped roasted acorns over a fresh salad roast the acorns once roasted remove and dip in very heavy sugar syrup make acorn brittle candy using a peanut brittle recipe and spread it on buttered plates to cool make an acorn nut butter spread that is similar to peanut almond hazelnut or sunflower seed nut butter use recipes for low carb pancakes as crepes or low carb biscuits of acorn starch spread with acorn butter and add stevia add acorns to stews as one might add beans or potatoes their nutty slightly sweet taste adds a lovely depth to stews add ground acorns to creamed mashed potatoes or potato salad this can give these standards a nice lift in flavour adding conversation piece value,Food-and-Entertaining

how to toast sliced almonds,almonds like many other nuts have a wonderfully rich earthy flavor when toasted however store bought toasted almonds can have a stale taste along with added fat and salt content since the nuts are not freshly roasted there are several methods for toasting almonds at home and each can be accomplished quickly with great results learning how to toast sliced almonds is primarily a matter of paying careful attention to the nuts to ensure that they don t burn,preheat your oven to 300 f 149 c most ovens require somewhere between 5 15 minutes to heat up to the desired temperature your oven may alert you when it is fully pre heated 1 x research source if not consider purchasing an oven thermometer to determine precisely when it s reached the correct temperature spread up to 1 cup 240 ml of sliced almonds on a baking sheet make sure the sliced almonds are arranged evenly in a single layer you can use anywhere between 1 2 cup 120 ml and 1 cup 240 ml of sliced almonds spread them across an ungreased rimmed baking sheet 2 x research source a rimmed baking sheet prevents the sliced almonds from spilling over the edges and burning in the oven 3 x research source place the almonds in the oven and bake for 8 minutes put the baking sheet on the middle rack so the nuts aren t too close the heating elements which could cause them to burn after about 8 minutes the almonds should begin to smell nutty and fragrant 4 x research source try not to get distracted by something else or leave the nuts unattended almond slices burn easily so you should stir them right at the 8 minute mark take the almonds out of the oven stir then put them back using pot holders to protect your hands from the heat pull the baking sheet out of the oven stir and flip the almond slices with a spatula or wooden spoon return the baking sheet to the oven and close the door 5 x research source you can also shake the baking sheet to help redistribute the nuts cook the almonds for another 5 8 minutes or until they are golden brown the almonds will take 10 15 minutes to toast completely but pay careful attention to avoid burning them you ll know the almonds are done when they re fragrant and golden brown around the edges 6 x research source take the almonds out before they turn dark brown since they ll continue to cook for a bit after you take them out of the oven cool and then store the sliced almonds allow the nuts to cool completely before using this will make them extra crunchy if you left the almonds in the oven for slightly too long transfer them immediately to a cool tray or bowl to prevent further toasting from the hot baking sheet 7 x research source if you re not using the almonds right away store them in a sealable plastic bag to preserve their flavor and texture they will retain their texture and flavor for up to 2 weeks use the sliced almonds as a topping or eat them alone toasted sliced almonds are very tasty and versatile and can be used in a wide variety of dishes they can add color texture and flavor when sprinkled on top of salads desserts and even pizza 8 x research source eat them on their own as a quick and healthy snack drizzle them in a little olive oil and sprinkle them with salt first if you like mix them into cake bread and muffin batters toasted almonds are less likely to sink to the bottom than regular almonds store the nuts in an airtight container for a maximum of 2 weeks they will still be safe to eat after 2 weeks but will start to lose their texture and flavor if you plan to store the almond slices immediately after toasting them make sure you ve allowed them to cool completely before storing 9 x research source you can also freeze the nuts which will keep them fresh for up to 3 months spread up to 1 cup 240 ml of almonds on your toaster oven tray depending on the size of your toaster oven you may need to use a smaller amount of sliced almonds make sure the nuts are spread evenly with minimal overlap to ensure that they toast evenly 10 x research source consider lining your tray in foil for easier cleanup however make sure to check the instructions for your specific toaster model first to confirm that it s equipped to handle aluminum foil 11 x research source set the toaster oven to 350 f 177 c and place the tray inside the process for toasting almonds in a toaster oven is very similar to toasting in a regular oven the major difference is that the heating elements are much closer to the almonds in a toaster oven meaning that they can burn more easily 12 x research source keep a close eye on the almonds throughout the entire process to make sure they don t burn bake the almond slices for 3 4 minutes then stir open the toaster oven and use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir and flip the almond slices this will ensure they cook evenly then close the toaster oven door 13 x research source you can also shake the tray to redistribute the nuts if you use this method make sure to use hot pads to avoid burning yourself on the hot tray repeat in 1 minute intervals until the nuts are golden brown make sure to stir or shake the almonds each minute to keep them toasting evenly depending on your toaster oven and the amount of nuts you re cooking it could take anywhere from 5 10 minutes 14 x research source the almonds will be done when they begin releasing a rich nutty fragrance and appear golden brown pour the nuts into another container and let them cool remove the tray from the toaster oven then transfer the nuts to a bowl or another tray this prevents the nuts from continuing to cook on the hot metal tray 15 x research source let the nuts sit for at least 15 minutes to fully cool store the nuts for up to 2 weeks toasted almonds can be kept in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks after that point they will still be safe to eat but will start to lose their texture and flavor 16 x research source place a sauté pan on the stove over medium heat use a heavy bottomed pan for best results make sure you have your ingredients within arms reach before you turn on the heat 17 x research source for this method you ll need 1 2 cup 120 ml of sliced almonds and optionally a small amount of butter or coconut oil add a small amount of butter to increase flavor if desired toss a small pat of butter or a dash of coconut oil in the pan and allow it to heat up for roughly 1 minute it s not necessary to grease the pan but adding butter or coconut oil can enhance the flavor of the almonds 18 x research source shake the pan a bit to let the melted butter or oil coat the bottom pour 1 2 cup 120 ml of almonds into the preheated pan once the pan heats up sprinkle the almonds across the pan in an even layer this method works best for smaller amounts of nuts 19 x research source try to keep the slices from bunching up in one section of the pan which will prevent them from toasting evenly stir or shake the pan every 30 seconds use a wooden spoon to stir or simply shake the pan using the handle this will prevent the nuts from burning as they start to cook you will see a small amount of moisture forming on top of the almonds this is the oil being released from the nuts by heat which will create a rich nutty flavor 20 x research source although the stovetop method is quick and easy the almond slices tend to roast a little unevenly it s important to keep the almonds moving if the pan you are using has a metal handle make sure to use an oven mitt when shaking to avoid burning your hand turn off the heat when the almonds develop browned edges the almonds should take between 3 and 5 minutes to toast on the stovetop remove the almonds from the heat when they begin to smell fragrant but before they start to fully brown 21 x research source once the almonds brown it s likely that they will burn pour the toasted almond slices into another dish to cool transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl or tray immediately to keep them from cooking further in the heated pan allow them to cool for roughly 15 minutes 22 x research source use the almonds immediately or store them for up to 2 weeks you can store the nuts on the counter or in the fridge for 1 2 weeks make sure they are stored in an airtight container 23 x research source if you freeze the nuts they will last anywhere from 1 3 months spread up to 1 cup 240 ml of sliced almonds on a microwave safe plate arrange them in a single layer with minimal overlap do not grease the plate place the plate into the microwave 24 x research source add a small amount of margarine butter or oil if desired use approximately 1 2 teaspoon 2 5 ml of butter or oil per 1 2 teaspoon fat per 1 2 cup 120 ml of nuts stir the almonds together with the oil or butter so they are thinly coated 25 x research source make sure the butter has been softened before trying to stir it in with the almonds adding a small amount of fat to the nuts will encourage browning and make the toasting process happen more quickly microwave the almonds on high for 1 minute then stir set the microwave to its highest power setting and cook the sliced almonds for 1 minute take them out of the microwave and stir them with a spoon then return the plate to the microwave 26 x research source stirring the almonds redistributes them and ensures they toast evenly repeat in 1 minute intervals until the nuts are golden brown and fragrant aim to remove the almonds from the microwave just before they start to brown and become fragrant this should take 3 5 minutes depending on your microwave s power 27 x research source all microwaves cook differently so keep a close eye on your nuts as they cook if you have an older model it may take longer to toast the almonds make sure to stir the almonds at each 1 minute interval to make sure they toast evenly allow the nuts to cool then use or store them for 1 2 weeks as long as they are stored in an airtight container the toasted almonds will be good for up to 2 weeks they can be kept in the fridge or at room temperature 28 x research source if you want the nuts to keep for longer store them in the freezer frozen almond slices can last for up to 3

time hours for breakfast lunch or dinner will make getting a reservation easier you should always have a backup date and time in case there is no availability at the original time you chose call as far ahead of time as possible in many cases you will be able to make a dinner reservation early in the same day however if you are planning the dinner ahead of time call earlier most restaurants will accept reservations a few days in advance and exclusive fine dining venues will often accept or even require reservations weeks or months in advance be as courteous as possible when booking a reservation if you are attempting to book a tough reservation remember that your attitude on the phone will go a long way be confident but polite avoid giving the impression that you feel entitled to a reservation however remember that even michelin starred restaurants are not in the business of turning away customers if the host replies that the restaurant has no availability explain your situation and ask politely if there is any way you can be accommodated in the future when calling say hi i d like to place a reservation for this coming saturday at 5 the host will then likely ask how many people are in your party and tell you if that time and date is available if it s not available try asking is there a table available for an earlier later time if the answer is still no ask if they can give you their earliest availability and go from there call to confirm your reservation if you book your table a week or more in advance it s sometimes good to call the day of your reservation just to double check that you still have it you should do this as early in the day as you can in case there is a problem this will allow you to make other plans if you need to or give you time to work out the problem with the restaurant call ahead or cancel if you are running late once you ve secured your reservation call ahead and apologize if it looks like you ll be up to 20 minutes late if you are running much later than that consider canceling and rescheduling your dinner remember that reservations are made for a reason to make sure as many guests as possible are served on each night if you are late it affects other guests reservations try to arrive 10 15 minutes before your reservation time this way you can let the hostess know you ve arrived and ensure that your table won t be given to someone else many restaurants will have a bar or waiting area that you can sit in and get drinks however remember to re approach the hostess when the time for your reservation comes up so you aren t passed over try the restaurant s website many restaurants allow you to book a reservation directly on their website when doing this you may also be able to see a list of all available dates and times for either the upcoming week or month the restaurant is likely to require you to create a login or provide an email address or phone number so they can confirm your reservations however they should not text or email you anything else outside of updates on your reservation use an online booking site or mobile application if you are unable to book a reservation directly on the restaurant s website you can try an online booking site like opentable or reservation genie these sites will allow you to search restaurants based on your preference of time date cuisine and price range there are also applications you can put on your phone like nowait which allows you to put your name in before heading to the restaurant an app like this is great for last minute reservations 2 x research source check your email and phone regularly once you ve made your reservations online you should receive a confirmation either by email or via text some of these sites or restaurants may require you to click a link or a button to confirm your reservation you may also be sent a link to cancel or change your reservation if you need to many of these online booking sites also offer coupons or have membership rewards programs through which you can accumulate perks if you can t cancel online you may have to call the restaurant directly,Food-and-Entertaining
how to scald milk,scalded milk helps make breads cakes and other baked goods both light and fluffy the process of scalding kills off the protein that s in milk which helps the gluten to remain unbroken and it aids the dissolving process of sugar and yeast which in turn makes fluffier breads and sweets 1 x research source learn how to scald milk both in the microwave and on the stovetop by gently bringing the temperature up and stopping before it actually starts to boil,pour the required amount of milk into a microwave safe bowl you can use whole milk skim milk or powdered milk you can try using other milks like almond cashew and soy but your baked goods probably won t have the same results because the non dairy milks don t have the same proteins that are changed by the scalding process 2 x research source glass bowls are the safest to use in the microwave if you re using a plastic bowl make sure it s specified that it s safe to microwave use a bowl that is deep enough that the milk won t easily splash over the sides put a wooden chopstick in the dish before microwaving the milk you can also use a bamboo skewer or some other microwaveable tool that has a long handle the chopstick breaks the surface of the milk and keeps it from boiling over while it s in the microwave 3 x research source it s okay if the chopstick or skewer touches the wall of the microwave it will simply move around the bowl if your microwave has a turntable microwave the milk for 30 seconds on medium high heat you don t need to put a cover on the dish heating for 30 seconds at a time will keep the milk from overheating and splattering all over the interior of your microwave 4 x research source it may be tempting to just put the dish in the microwave for 3 4 minutes at once but doing this will cause the milk to heat unevenly and may even scorch or burn the milk remove the dish with hot pads and stir the milk with a wooden spoon this helps to disperse the heat evenly throughout the milk you can also use a silicone spoon you just want to avoid using anything that has metal in it as the metal can react with the milk s proteins in an undesirable way 5 x research source you can buy wooden or silicone spoons from any local home goods store or you can buy them online check the milk s temperature using a candy thermometer put the thermometer into the milk in the middle of the bowl don t let it touch the bottom or sides of the dish hold it in place for 10 15 seconds or until the probe stops moving 6 x research source you can buy an inexpensive candy thermometer from any department store or order one online keep heating stirring and checking the temperature every 30 seconds heating the milk gradually rather than all at once keeps your milk from boiling burning or getting too hot it generally takes about 3 4 minutes for milk to get to the appropriate temperature in the microwave so you will repeat the process of heating and stirring about 6 8 times 7 x research source stirring also helps prevent the milk from developing a film across the top stop microwaving the milk once it reaches 180 f 82 c don t let it exceed 212 f 100 c if it does exceed 212 f 100 c you will need to start over again with fresh milk the proteins and chemistry of the milk changes when it boils and won t react the same way in your recipe as scalded milk would 8 x research source always use your hot pads to remove the bowl from the microwave let the milk cool to room temperature before adding it to your recipe it may seem strange to heat milk only to let it cool down again before using it but it s not the temperature of the milk that matters it s what happens to the proteins during the scalding process let the milk cool to at least 105 f 41 c before using it in your recipe 9 x research source putting hot milk into your recipe could ruin the other ingredients for example really hot milk could curdle or cook eggs or it could kill off essential yeast pour the measured milk into a saucepan on the stove measuring the milk beforehand helps ensure you don t waste milk by using too much or end up with too little for your recipe plus it makes it easier to just pour the milk in with your other ingredients without having to use another measuring cup after it has been scalded 10 x research source a heavy bottom pan is best for scalding milk because it will help it heat more evenly 11 x research source whole skim or powdered milk works best for scalding milks like almond soy cashew or coconut lack the essential proteins that are affected by the scalding process turn the oven heat to medium low this low temperature will keep your milk from heating too quickly which in turn prevents it from burning you want the milk heated through but you don t want it to actually boil or stick to the bottom of the pan 12 x research source watch your milk during the entire heating and scalding process it should only take 4 5 minutes to scald stir frequently until you see steam and bubbles appearing at the edge stirring helps prevent a protein film from developing on the surface of the milk which would be unusable in a baking recipe it also helps to disperse the heat evenly 13 x research source you can use either a wooden or silicone spoon to stir the milk don t use anything with metal in it as that can react with the milk proteins remove the pan from the heat as soon as the milk starts to bubble you will see small bubbles appear across the entire body of milk but you don t want to let those little bubbles progress to a roiling boil like you see when you boil water for pasta 14 x research source make sure to place the pan onto a heat resistant surface you can move it to another part of the stove or put it onto a hot pad or trivet on the counter let the temperature cool down to about 105 f 41 c putting freshly scalded milk in with your other ingredients could kill off yeast or actually cook eggs which would drastically change the outcome of your baked good it will take 5 10 minutes for the milk to cool down sufficiently use that time to continue prepping the rest of the ingredients in your recipe 15 x research source use your candy thermometer to check the temperature of the milk just put it in the milk making sure it doesn t touch the bottom or the sides and wait about 15 seconds or until the gauge stops moving,Food-and-Entertaining
how to rinse rice,as one of the most popular grains worldwide rice is part of almost every great culinary tradition this can lead to culture clashes when different cooks meet even over simple matters like whether to rinse your rice in much of asia where rice was first domesticated thorough washing is an unavoidable part of cooking perfectly steamed rice in many western countries a greater tolerance for clumps and a habit of adding powdered vitamins before sale has made rinsing less common and even nutritionally harmful whatever you were taught it s worth trying a thorough wash at least once to bring a simple bowl of rice to the heights it deserves,pour the rice into a bowl choose a wide bowl with room to stir the rice you can instead use a special rice draining colander which has extra small holes so the water pools and drains slowly submerge the rice in water fill the bowl with tap water until the rice is completely covered about three times as much water as rice should work stir the rice around with clean hands the rice will rub against itself your hands and the bowl which scrapes the starch off use light pressure to avoid breaking the rice grains 1 x research source tilt the bowl to pour out the starchy water since rice is not buoyant it will sink to the bottom of the bowl pour out the cloudy water plus anything that has floated to the surface pour the water through the palm of your hand so you can catch any rice that slips out 2 x research source if the water looked dirty or an opaque milky white you can repeat this process with a second bowl of water as long as there is no dirt or pesticides in the water you can save it to add to recipes the most common use of starchy water is as a thickener for sauces punch the rice gently at this point many western cooks may be satisfied moving on to cooking the rice japanese and other asian traditions however put great value in cleaning the rice thoroughly to achieve a perfect fluffy texture the next step in that process is polishing the rice grains against each other curl your fingers into a loose fist and punch the rice gently at a steady pace turn the bowl between punches to move the wet rice around the bowl grinding it lightly against itself 3 x research source rinse and repeat after a few punches pour in more water swirl the rice around and pour it out again punch and turn a few more times add more water and pour it out repeat this until the water runs clear depending on the type of rice and how it was processed this may take a couple bowlfuls of water or it may take several minutes of washing soak the rice if desired transfer the wet rice to a mesh sieve to drain leave it there to soak for at least thirty minutes if you have the time this gives the moisture on the rice time to soak into the center of the grain ensuring an even texture once cooked soaking your rice lowers the cooking time the exact amount of time it saves depends on the type of rice and how long you soaked it so you may need to experiment aromatic rices such as basmati and jasmine rice benefit from soaking in another way the flavor components that create the aroma are destroyed by cooking so shorter cooking times means a more aromatic final dish 4 x research source understand the effect of rinsing on starch one major effect of rinsing is the removal of starch that clings to the outside of the rice grains if left unrinsed the starch can cause rice grains to stick together creating clumps or a glutinous texture 5 x research source when you re making steamed rice rinse it first to remove the starch and make clump free fluffy rice if you re making a creamy dish like risotto or a sticky dish like rice pudding however you need the starch to achieve the right texture thorough rinsing will remove that starch and leave you with a watery dish 6 x research source short grain rice is the most likely to stick together while long grain rice like basmati tends to cook into dry separated grains 7 x research source if you want to make risotto but the rice is dirty rinse it then add a couple spoonfuls of homemade rice flour to the recipe this will return the starch to the dish 8 x research source rinse off contaminants in the united states most domestically grown rice has been washed before sale and contains few contaminants rice grown in many other countries however may contain dirt insects pesticides or small rocks if you notice a powder on the surface of the grain this may be talc or another substance added to improve appearance this is edible but your rice will cook better and taste better if you rinse it off 9 x research source contaminants may be more likely in bulk bags of rice save the nutrients on enriched rice enriched white rice has been thoroughly washed then coated with a dust of vitamins and nutrients rinsing will remove a large portion of these beneficial ingredients this rice is typically low in dirt and other contaminants but it does still contain surface starch in the united states some enriched rice labels include a warning not to rinse the rice for this reason if u s enriched rice does not have this label you can rinse it for one minute without major loss of nutrients 10 x research source consider arsenic risk for young children more than other crops rice tends to pick up arsenic that naturally occurs in in water and soil if rice is a major part of an infant s or pregnant woman s diet this could affect the child s development the us fda recommends feeding babies and toddlers a variety of grains instead of only rice to reduce this risk rinsing only has a small effect on arsenic content a more effective treatment is cooking the rice in lots of water a 1 6 to 1 10 ratio then draining the excess water before eating 11 x trustworthy source us food

how to hold a spoon,although proper spoon use varies from culture to culture you can learn a universal way to hold a spoon to allow for the widest field of motion the trick is to rest the spoon on your bottom three fingers and allow your wrist to do most of the work,use your dominant hand most people use their right hand when reaching for a spoon 1 x research source however you want to be able to control your motions carefully therefore it s best to use your dominant hand be careful if you re sitting next to someone whose dominant hand is different from your own be conscientious of your movements to avoid accidentally knocking elbows with them hold the spoon horizontally you want to hold your spoon horizontally as you move it this will prevent food from spilling while you eat keep your spoon steady with the first knuckle of your index finger and the tip of your middle finger holding it at a horizontal angle 2 x research source rest the handle across your middle finger curl your middle finger ring finger and pinky fingers inward and lay the handle of the spoon overtop the middle finger with the dome of the spoon pointing towards your other hand rest the portion of the spoon s handle right before the head on your index finger allow the end of the handle to rest on the curve made by your thumb 3 x research source hold the spoon in place with your thumb and index finger place your thumb and index finger on top of the end of the spoon press down on the end so that the spoon is held between the top of your middle finger and your thumb and index finger this should keep the spoon secure while you re eating and drinking 4 x research source turn your wrist to dip the spoon holding the spoon like this allows you a greater field of motion when you turn your wrist away from you the spoon will dip downwards into your food and when you turn it towards you the spoon will turn back up this is a more flexible position than if you held the spoon in say a fist or between your thumb and index finger use the side of the spoon bring the spoon to your mouth and eat from the broad side of the spoon rather than the tip you can use your wrist here to tilt the spoon upwards to aid in eating 5 x research source eat slowly and gently foods that you eat with a spoon are frequently liquid based it is easy to make slurping noises when eating with a spoon to minimize noise when eating eat very slowly make sure to open your mouth wide enough to get food in without having to resort to slurping 6 x research source eating food slowly will also help you best enjoy the taste and texture of your food keep your grip firm make sure to grip firmly on your spoon when you eat keeping a loose grip can cause you to drop your spoon which can cause a mess and loud noises keep your grip firm enough that the spoon does not wobble in your hands while you eat 7 x research source use your spoon for the right dishes spoons are used to eat liquid based food such as soups spoons are also used to eat mushier softer foods such as ice cream and mashed potatoes use your spoon for these types of foods and avoid using it to eat solid foods it can be hard to maneuver foods like meats and vegetables using a spoon 8 x research source place your spoon on your plate when finished when you re done it s customary to set your spoon down on your plate always plate your spoon on the plate from which you were eating if you were eating soup place the spoon on the plate your soup bowl was resting on 9 x research source in general you should not place your spoon back in a bowl when you finish eating this could confuse waitstaff as they may think you re still eating however if no plate was provided it s okay to put your spoon back in the bowl you do not want to get food residue on the table do not use your fingers never push food onto your spoon using your fingers this is considered bad table manners if you have to push food to eat with a spoon it is probably better to use a fork for this type of food 10 x research source avoid pointing with your spoon never use your spoon to point at other guests while talking or otherwise gesticulating only use your spoon for eating if you re using your hands to do things like gesticulate while at the table set your spoon down while doing so 11 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to brown ground beef,browning ground beef is a way to cook the meat and remove the fat before adding the beef to a dishes such as tacos or chili the most common way to cook beef is on a stovetop but you can do it easily in a microwave as well no matter which way you choose browning is simple and can lead to crisp flavorful ground beef,thaw the beef in the refrigerator for a day if it is frozen fresh ground beef doesn t need to be thawed but frozen ground beef should be moved to the refrigerator before you need to cook it keep it wrapped in its original packaging the cool temperature protects it from bacteria as it unfreezes so you can keep the ground beef in there for up to 2 days after defrosting 1 x research source if you need to thaw larger packages of beef give them additional time in the refrigerator for example a 2 lb 0 91 kg package of beef needs to be in the refrigerator for 2 days if you are in a hurry move the beef to the microwave use a defrost setting or set your microwave to 50 power gradually heat the meat until it is no longer icy but still cold another way to defrost is with cold water in your sink keep your beef in its plastic wrapping or move it to a watertight container submerge the beef changing out the water every 30 minutes keep doing this until the beef is cool but not icy spray a frying pan with nonstick cooking spray the spray prevents the ground beef from sticking to itself and the sides of the pan it makes cooking a lot easier if you have a nonstick pan spraying the pan isn t necessary but it can still be helpful make sure you fully coat a frying pan big enough to hold all of the meat you wish to cook 2 x research source your pan needs to provide plenty of space so you can move the beef around if you are cooking more than 1 lb 0 45 kg at a time you may need to cook the beef in batches instead of cooking spray you can add up to 2 tsp 9 9 ml of a cooking oil to the pan this is useful for lean beef or nonstick pans heat the pan over medium high heat get your pan nice and hot before adding the beef you can test this by adding a few drops of water to the pan when the pan is hot enough the water will evaporate immediately that means your pan is ready for the beef 3 x research source a cold pan won t cook the beef properly the beef will begin losing juices without browning and turn gray remember that adding cold beef lowers the pan s temperature so heat the pan well before cooking put the beef in the pan and let it brown for 3 minutes drop the beef into the pan without breaking it up a good strategy to keep in mind is to move the beef as infrequently as possible let it cook for at least 2 or 3 minutes so it turns a nice even brown on 1 side when you notice the edges crisping you know the beef is ready to be flipped 4 x research source infrequent stirring ensures that all sides of the beef get a chance to brown evenly ground beef cooks very quickly so don t walk away from your stove avoid adding water to the pan unless you want gray steamed beef if you wish to use water add 1 4 c 59 ml for every 1 lb 0 45 kg of beef you cook flip the beef over and break it into small chunks with a spoon the beef will break apart a little when you flip it but continue to divide larger pieces by pressing the edge of your spoon or spatula down onto them make sure all of the beef is flipped over onto its pink side then let it cook for another 2 or 3 minutes 5 x research source ground beef breaks apart easily so stirring it in the pan isn t much of a challenge despite the short cooking time now is a good time to sprinkle the beef with a generous amount of salt to draw out additional flavor turn the meat often until all red and pink parts turn brown stir the beef in the pan using your wooden spoon or spatula continuing to break up large pieces find any uncooked surfaces and keep them down against the pan cook the beef for a minute or 2 before stirring and checking again ensure the meat is fully cooked by checking the temperature with a thermometer all pieces should be at least 160 f 71 c 6 x research source ground beef takes approximately 7 to 10 minutes to cook all the way through although this varies depending on your stove turning the beef often ensures that 1 section doesn t stay directly on the pan for too long and burn pour the beef into a colander to drain the fat and juices hold the colander over a trash bag if possible or set it on top of another pot you can spoon the beef into the colander with a slotted spoon to avoid picking up most of the juice in the pan dump the fat into the trash once it cools 7 x research source another way to do this is to set out some paper towels on a plate lay the beef on the paper towels then use another paper towel to dab the beef dry try not to pour grease down the sink since it can lead to clogs defrost the beef for a day in the refrigerator if it is frozen when using a microwave you have to pack the beef into a microwaveable container frozen beef is too solid for you to do this effectively thaw the beef first by moving it to the refrigerator a day before you need to cook it 8 x research source you can also use the defrost or 50 power on your setting to heat the beef until it is no longer icy defrosting in cold water also can work make sure your beef is in a watertight container submerge the container in the water draining and replacing the water every 30 minutes until the beef is no longer frozen choose a microwave safe container or plate cook ground beef only in a container or plate that can withstand the intense heat glass or ceramic such as a casserole dish usually work well get a shallow circular container if you can since the shape helps the beef cook more evenly choose a dish large enough to hold all of the beef or microwave it in separate batches if necessary 9 x research source a metal steamer basket or colander can be effective for microwaving ground beef you can also place the beef in a bowl set in the basket or colander to automatically drain fat some plastic containers release harmful chemicals when heated check plastic containers to see if they have the words microwave safe printed on them avoid using a container if you aren t sure it is safe arrange the beef so it is as flat on your plate or container place your plate or container in the microwave take the beef out of its packaging then spread it out across the plate you shouldn t have any trouble pressing the beef down by hand or with a spoon break the beef into smaller chunks as needed to distribute it evenly across your container 10 x research source if the beef is hard to break apart defrost it in the microwave at a low temperature for about 2 minutes then try again you can add 1 cup 240 ml of lukewarm water to the container to speed up the cooking time this will cause your beef to turn more gray than brown since it will cook through steaming cover the container with a microwave safe lid make sure the lid is designed for heat exposure glass ceramic and safe plastic lids are all acceptable especially if they match the container microwave safe lids won t retain enough steam during the short cooking time so you don t have to worry about your microwave turning into modern beef art 11 x research source if you don t have a matching lid cover the container with a tight layer of plastic wrap cut some vents into the wrap so steam escapes cook the beef on medium heat for 5 minutes choose a number 5 or 50 power setting on your microwave such a low heat setting cannot cook the beef all the way through but it can cause the beef to warm more evenly high temperatures tend to leave the edges of the beef piping hot and the center stone cold similar to that frozen pizza pocket you may have tried heating once 12 x research source you can adjust the settings if you wish microwaving on a high heat setting is fine but be cautious make sure the beef reaches a safe temperature before you use it consider cooking the beef for shorter bursts as well such as 2 minutes at a time this will ensure that the temperature stays consistent across the beef break the beef apart and stir it in the container use a wooden spoon or another tool to divide up the ground beef as much as possible rearrange it in the container so the colder pinker parts are on the outside and the warmer browner parts are in the center flatten the beef out as much as possible before putting the lid back on 13 x research source stirring the beef is an important part of getting an even brown coloring since microwaves cannot heat all of it consistently cook and stir the beef again as necessary until it is brown cook the beef for 2 to 5 minutes take it out of the microwave and stir it to bring any pink parts to the outside of the container you may need to do this a few times before the beef is cooked all the way through when it is finished it should be completely brown and have an internal temperature of 160 f 71 c which you can check with a thermometer 14 x research source expect the cooking process to take between 7 to 10 minutes not counting the time spent stopping and stirring this will depend on the heat settings you use drain the beef in a colander set out a colander and dump the beef into it to eliminate the fat ideally you should avoid letting the fat drain down the sink but this can be tough to do with a colander you can try holding the colander over a pot jar or another container then dumping the beef into it 15 x research source you can also set the cooked beef on paper towels pat it down to speed up the drying process wait for the fat to cool before putting it in the trash,Food-and-Entertaining
how to prepare and use strawberries,strawberries are a traditional taste of summer they can be eaten fresh and used in desserts to save your strawberries for as long as possible keep them cool and dry in the fridge washing and hulling them only when you intend to eat them add strawberries to your favorite smoothie pancakes waffles or even salad or use them to make a classic dessert like strawberry shortcake or chocolate dipped strawberries contents,select bright fresh looking berries avoid shriveled dried up or moldy berries avoid soggy strawberries too as this means they are past their prime a good strawberry is firm and shiny 1 x research source choose organic strawberries if you can as non organic strawberries can be quite pesticide laden some cooks believe smaller strawberries have more flavor due to a higher concentration of sugars rinse strawberries under running water when you are ready to eat them only rinse strawberries right before you plan to eat them as washing them will cause them to go bad more quickly rub the berries gently under running water to make sure each berry is clean and free of as much soil as possible most strawberries sold at the grocery store are fairly clean so a brief rinsing should do the trick 2 x research source if you plan to freeze your strawberries wash them first strawberries can become mushy if they are under water too long a quicker rinse will help them keep their firm texture rinse non organic strawberries more thoroughly and consider using a drop of mild dish soap or white vinegar to clean them dry the strawberries thoroughly after washing them let the strawberries drain in a colander or place them on a paper towel to soak up any excess water if you are only rinsing a few strawberries pat them gently with a towel to dry them more quickly drying strawberries after washing them will help keep them from getting mushy 3 x research source the more moisture strawberries soak up the more mushy the texture will be hull and slice the strawberries right before you want to eat them hull the berries by removing the green cap and pale flesh with a paring knife or a strawberry huller on a fully ripe strawberry you can hull it by gently pulling on the leaves until the stem comes out slice them if you prefer by standing them on the flat edge and using a paring knife to cut them in half or smaller 4 x research source the stem of a strawberry keeps it fresher for longer only remove it when you are ready to eat the strawberry leave strawberries on the counter if you plan to eat them within the day fresh strawberries will last for about 24 hours at room temperature rinse and hull strawberries right before you eat them 5 x research source after around 24 hours strawberries will get moldy at room temperature store strawberries in the refrigerator for up to a week store strawberries whole and unwashed for up to 7 days in the fridge prepare the strawberries when you are ready to use them 6 x research source some strawberries will last a little shorter or longer in the fridge check the strawberries for mold before using them soak strawberries in a vinegar solution to make them last longer fill a glass bowl with a mixture of 1 part white vinegar and 3 parts water add the strawberries into the bowl and let them soak for 5 minutes rinse and dry the strawberries store them in the fridge in a partially covered container lined with a paper towel 7 x research source the vinegar kills spores that form mold on strawberries strawberries can last up to a couple of weeks using this method you won t need to rinse your strawberries again when you are ready to eat them if you soak them in vinegar try a heat bath if your berries tend to go bad quickly bring a pot of water up to 120 f 49 c plunge the strawberries into the bath for 30 seconds then take the strawberries out of the water and let them cool and dry on a paper towel repack them and store them in the fridge 8 x research source if you frequently buy berries only to have them go bad the next day in the fridge try this method you won t need to rinse your strawberries again when you are ready to eat them if you use a heat bath freeze strawberries for up to 6 months arrange washed and hulled strawberries on a baking pan lined with parchment paper in a single layer so that the strawberries aren t touching freeze them for around 1 4 hours until they are frozen solid remove the frozen strawberries from the baking sheet and place them in freezer safe storage bags put the strawberries back into the freezer for up to 6 months 9 x research source frozen strawberries are good for smoothies pies cobblers crisps and compotes to help the strawberries freeze faster slice them into halves or quarters it s also much easier to cut fresh strawberries than frozen strawberries buy frozen strawberries if you can t find any fresh frozen strawberries have the same nutritional content and flavor as fresh strawberries but they will lose their texture and become mushy when you defrost them typically they are best for baking and smoothies as cooking or blending strawberries makes them lose their texture anyway 10 x research source try adding frozen strawberries to smoothies oatmeal or cakes frozen strawberries are usually good for about 6 months add sliced frozen strawberries into smoothies a strawberry banana smoothie is a classic combination to make one blend 1 banana 2 cups 400 g of frozen strawberries 1 2 cup 120 ml of plain yogurt and 1 cup 240 ml of milk until the mixture is smooth 11 x research source you can also add in 1 tablespoon 15 ml or so of honey if the smoothie isn t sweet enough or 1 tsp 3 g of chia seeds to thicken and add fiber to the smoothie add a spoonful of nut butter for more protein you can also use fresh strawberries in smoothies along with 3 4 ice cubes make chocolate dipped strawberries for a fun and popular dessert put 2 cups 350 g of semisweet chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons 30 ml of coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time stirring between until the mixture is completely melted and smooth dip strawberries into the chocolate and place them on parchment paper put them in the fridge to harden for 30 minutes 12 x research source for a variation try using white chocolate or add sprinkles or nuts while the chocolate is still wet make strawberry shortcake for a summery dessert to make a quick and easy strawberry shortcake use a store bought shortcake add sliced strawberries and whipped cream on top of the shortcake to go the extra mile make the shortcake and the whipped cream by hand add balsamic strawberries to a salad to make balsamic strawberries combine 2 tablespoons 30 ml of balsamic vinegar and 1 4 c 50 g of sugar to 16 oz 450 g of strawberries mix and let the strawberries sit for around an hour add the strawberries to a spinach or kale salad with ingredients like pine nuts walnuts goat cheese or beets 13 x research source you can also add plain

for his work in cultivating and informing the public about the nutritional benefits of the peanut peanut butter can trace its roots far back to the aztecs who used to grind peanuts into paste for food learn about choosing good peanut butter use it in simple sandwiches and meals and how to work it into more advanced recipes,pick chunky or smooth just like there are elvis people and beatles people

and creamy there is no wrong answer some studies show that in the united states women who live on the east coast will gravitate toward smooth peanut butter while male californians and other west coasters will more often pick chunky go figure 1 x research source read the label and look at the ingredients good peanut butter should only have two ingredients peanuts salt and possibly a sweetener like honey or sugar if you see added hydrogenated oils steer clear natural peanut butter is more expensive because it contains the peanut oil which will settle on the top of the jar and need to be stirred in before use the most valuable product of the peanut is in the oil which large food companies will extract from the peanuts ground into peanut butter and then replace with sunflower oil so while it seems like you re getting whole ground up peanuts in a jar of skippy or jif you re really getting peanuts and the oil of other cheaper nuts avoid reduced fat peanut butter while it might seem like a healthier alternative peanut butters that are advertised as reduced fat usually include more hydrogenated oils and more sugars but the same amount of calories to account for the loss of fat essentially used as a marketing scheme this ploy ignores the fact that healthy fats from natural peanut butter are more effective as sources of fats reduced fat peanut butter replaces mono saturated healthy fats with refined sugars and carbohydrates causing blood sugar spikes it s not good for you 2 x research source consider grinding your own if you re a particular peanut butter eater you might enjoy mixing up your own batches and perfecting your recipe pick nuts you like the taste of grind them in a food processor and add a small amount of honey or salt to taste as you grind you might need

freshly ground peanut butter it s pretty much the best and the easiest way to get it find one close to you and give it a try consider other nut butters peanut butter is the classic stand by but if you re looking to spice it up a bit you can experiment with other more exotic nut butters to throw a little variety into the mix they re typically more expensive but feature completely different flavors

allergy you might be fine with tree nuts depending on the severity of your allergy find out if some of these alternatives might be more right for you 4 x research source try mixed peanut butters why

oatmeal for added protein other breakfast items are perfectly amenable to the addition of peanut butter for thickening and adding a salty sweet flavor underneath add a spoonful to cooked oatmeal to liven up the flavor without adding sugar or use it to thicken a breakfast smoothie for a simple nutritious smoothie add a half cup of plain greek yoghurt to your blender one banana a cup of fresh or

how to tip your server at a restaurant,tipping your server in a restaurant is expected although not legally required in the united states there are customary amounts that you should leave for good service in other countries tipping rules can vary widely it s a good idea to let your server know if he or she has done a good job though,tip your us server at least 15 percent the baseline for how much you should tip your server in the united states is at least 15 percent when eating in a restaurant however this is generally considered the minimum if you leave anything less than this it s likely the server will be very offended be aware that tipping only the basic 15 percent is considered a statement that the service was just average or ok to some servers consider tipping more if you thought the service was better than average consider tipping 20 percent if the service was good 25 percent if the service was great and 30 percent if the service was exceptional 1 x research source some people believe you should also tip 2 for each person at the table if that amount is higher than the tip percentage would be use math to figure out the tip some people struggle to figure out how much 15 percent is exactly you can use an easy math shortcut to determine the amount you need to leave to figure out the tip you will need to do a simple mathematical equation some suggest rounding the bill up to the nearest 10 before figuring out the tip on the total 2 x research source move the decimal point to the left on your final bill amount that s 10 percent so if your bill is 55 00 10 percent is 5 50 to figure out 15 take half of 5 50 and add it to the 5 50 thus 15 percent would be 8 25 to calculate 20 percent shift the decimal point on your bill amount to the left round up for example 35 84 would become 3 58 remember that s 10 percent then double the number to get 20 percent check whether the tip is already included there will be some circumstances where the tip will already be factored into your bill in those cases you don t need to tip again typically the gratuity will be 15 or 18 percent when it s automatically included some restaurants have a rule that the tip is automatically included when large groups dine it will usually say gratuity included on your bill or the menu in those cases this is done because if even one or two people in the group were to skimp on the tip the server would be unlikely to make the basic amount large groups are very time consuming for a server and more work you should ask in advance or check the menu or restaurant website to see if the gratuity is included tip other restaurant staff if your waiter or waitress is not the only person who s served you in some way it s customary to tip the other servers too for example if you received the benefit of a wine steward it s customary to also tip 15 percent the cost of the bottle of wine you can tip the coatroom attendant about 1 per coat or 2 for the parking valet or garage attendant if you ve left your car with them while dining you can leave a smaller tip to your restaurant server if the food is served buffet style or the server brings you drinks only but you should still tip between 10 and 15 percent some restaurants have washroom attendants tip them 50 cents to 1 you might want to tip the headwaiter or captain separately also when buying something over a counter say morning coffee you are generally not expected to tip use a tip generating app you can download apps to your smart phone that will calculate the tip for you if you plug in the amount of your bill most smart phones also come with a calculator which will allow you to calculate the tip yourself depending on the amount you decide to leave various websites will calculate the tip for you all you have to do is plug in the amount of your bill and the percentage amount of the tip you want to leave 3 x research source in some states the sales tax is about 5 percent if that s the case you could multiply the sales tax listed on your bill by three in order to get 15 percent if you used any coupons or discounts calculate the tip based on how much you would ve paid without it otherwise you re punishing the waiter for the restaurant management s efforts to bring you in the door realize why tipping matters many servers absolutely rely on tips to survive the fact they receive tips is calculated into a lower hourly wage in the first place it s not uncommon for servers to make just over 2 an hour before they receive tips they often make well under minimum wage although american states have different minimum wages the federal minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers is just 2 13 4 x research source some servers also are required to share or pool their tips at the end of the night or to contribute for tips to bartenders lowering their overall haul you are not legally required to leave a tip however you re being very unfair to your server if you do not do so 5 x research source leave a smaller tip for very poor service there s no upside in being a jerk but if you truly received awful service you shouldn t feel obligated to leave a full tip try communicating with the server first though about what s making you unhappy to give the server a chance to fix it a tip to a server is meant to acknowledge good service if your server ignored you had a bad attitude or served your food late it s ok to not leave a full tip assess how the food matched your order whether the food was hot and fresh how attentive the server was how quickly your empty dishes were removed and whether the server was courteous you might want to explain the lack of a tip in nice and constructive terms on the bill when you pay the check though some believe you should still give at least 10 percent even if you ve received poor service 6 x research source take care to determine whether the poor service was really the server s fault for example perhaps the kitchen didn t get the food to the server on time or management understaffed the restaurant tell your server if the service was great it can make a server s day to be told you thought their service wasn t just good but was impeccable why not let them know write a little note on the bill when you pay your bill explaining what you thought the server did really well better yet call over the manager and tell the manager about the good job the server did always treat your server to a smile and be kind and polite service jobs can be stressful enough without people taking out their bad days on the server make sure tips are accepted in most establishments in the us tips are not only accepted but they are encouraged because the servers rely on them to make enough money to survive in some other countries tips might be considered insulting or not allowed there are some venues where tips may not be allowed for example some all inclusive resorts in the caribbean may discourage tipping because a service fee is already woven into the overall vacation cost if you are attending a group gathering paid for in advance by someone else such as a wedding reception it s possible that the gratuity was already paid in advance by the person who paid for the event 7 x research source there s no harm in leaving an extra tip in a situation like that though if you can afford to do so the server will likely appreciate it tip sparingly in europe the culture around tipping in europe is not the same as tipping in the us tipping is expected in the us but in europe it s often not expected at all 8 x research source start by looking at the restaurant s menu to see if it lists service as being included if it s not you could leave between 5 and 10 percent it would be considered a lot and unusual to tip more in some countries the difference is that servers in europe are often better paid than they are in the us meaning they rely on tips far less to survive and are likely to consider the tip as a small and unexpected bonus it s a good idea to hand the tip to the server rather than leaving it on the table you might see a 12 5 percent optional tip on some menus in london tip wisely in other areas of the world tipping customs vary widely depending on the country you re visiting it s a good idea to research the country s practices before you embark on your trip in the middle east tipping will be appreciated even in small amounts some governments like dubai mandate a 10 percent service charge to bills at restaurants in egypt the tip is often included in the bill but you can add 5 10 percent above that in israel and jordan the tip is usually included in the bill canada is similar to the united states so tip between 15 and 20 percent there in some south american countries like chile a 10 percent tip is included in the bill in mexico cash is preferred and the tip should generally be 10 15 percent in australia leave between 10 to 15 percent avoid tipping in most parts of asia some asian countries may frown on tipping check into the local customs and make sure that tipping is not seen as an insult china has a no tipping culture although you could leave a tip in fine hotels and restaurants that cater to foreigners in japan the owner might be insulted by the tip taking it as a statement by you that they don t pay their servers well enough in some asian countries though it s ok to tip in thailand leave about 1 for the waiter,Food-and-Entertaining
how to write a cookbook,writing a cookbook is often a dream of the avid home cook and why not recipes are a treasure trove of experience history and love all rolled into one start with a broad idea of what you d like your cookbook to be about organize and refine the recipes that you want to use in the book and have people test your recipes once you re happy with your cookbook find an agent or publishing company to produce your cookbook or consider self publishing your cookbook or ebook,choose the focus or theme of the cookbook if you want to write a cookbook chances are you already have a general idea of what you want to write about start with a broad style of food or specific type of diet from there you can begin to narrow down exactly what you ll write about for example you might want to write a dessert cookbook or a party food and appetizer cookbook find your niche once you ve chosen a broad theme narrow down the focus of your cookbook so it really stands apart while lots of new cookbooks are published every year you ll increase the chances of being published if you make yours stand out from the others if you have a unique take on a cooking style or food you might want to make that the focus of your cookbook 1 x research source for example your dessert cookbook could contain recipes on how to make sophisticated s mores or the party and appetizer cookbook could focus on foods that are paleo diet friendly decide if you re writing the cookbook for personal or professional use if you d simply like to write a cookbook for your own use in the kitchen or to give to family and friends you can be more casual with the writing photo quality if you even take pictures and structure of the book if you want to write a cookbook to be published you ll need to make the book as polished creative and original as possible to make a personal cookbook you can write it up on your computer in a readable pdf file print the file and have it bound at a copy or printing place research what s popular if you re struggling to narrow the scope of your cookbook you might want to contact a few publishing companies briefly tell the publishing company that you re writing a cookbook and you d like to know if the publishing company is actively looking for specific types of cookbooks you can also check popular websites for new food trends products or diets 2 x research source remember that you ll want your cookbook to stand out so you might even want to combine a few popular combinations like how to ferment spiralized foods or make gluten free cake pops decide the style of the cookbook once you ve narrowed down the scope of your cookbook decide the mood and feel of the book determine if you d like to simply give recipes or if your cookbook will also tell a story a narrative might help to make your cookbook stand out from others especially if it has a broad theme 3 x research source for example if you re writing about cooking for a family you can add interest about writing about what makes your family unique for example tell stories about cooking for your large family your family with several dietary restrictions or cooking a specific style of food for your family on a budget create a rough outline of the contents before you begin to assemble recipes decide on a loose outline of the cookbook this way you ll be able to plug recipes into their chapters or tell a story along with the recipes if you re having trouble with an outline look through some of your favorite cookbooks to get organizational ideas for example your dessert cookbook might have 4 chapters one on classic cake pops one on gluten free cake pops one on shaped cake pops and one on savory cake pops while it s okay to be slightly quirky remember that readers usually expect standard cookbooks to be arranged from savory to sweet starters to mains to dessert or from inexperienced cook to skilled in the kitchen gather your own recipes examine all the recipes you have on your cookbook theme sort through them for recipes that you think taste the best and that you d like to include in the cookbook select 10 to 15 more recipes than you plan on putting in the cookbook avoid including recipes that you have had trouble making or aren t passionate about 4 x research source think about the recipes that you ve made for other people if any of them were a big hit include them in the cookbook make the recipes and write down tips test more recipes than you think you ll need since you may change your mind about using some of them as you test write very detailed descriptions of how to make each recipe include helpful tips to encourage your readers to make the food try to give substitutions for ingredients and variations for the recipes 5 x research source for example instead of saying cream the butter and sugar instruct your readers to beat room temperature butter with the sugar on medium speed until it s light and fluffy ask other people to test your recipes this way you can get feedback about how clear your instructions were how the food tasted and where you need to improve the recipe write each recipe as you want it to appear in the cookbook read over all of the testing notes and any feedback you got from others create a detailed recipe by explaining how to cook or assemble the ingredients be as clear and thorough as you can so people of many skill levels can cook your food diagrams and illustrations may be as helpful as photos in some cases if you can t draw find someone who is willing to help out take photographs of the food high resolution quality photos help the reader imagine the end result of a recipe and inspire them to make the dish decide if you d like to take a photo for every recipe or just include a few for each chapter if your photography skills need brushing up take a quick class or learn how to use photo editing software to edit the pictures 6 x research source you can also hire a photographer to photograph your food but this will add to the cost of making your cookbook give proper credit to others all the recipes in your book should be written by you or at least changed in some way to make them your own while lists of ingredients and very basic recipe instructions are not covered by copyright the words used to describe the methods in each step or as a whole are copyright if you ve changed a recipe from another person give them credit for the recipe for example if you ve made a few small changes to someone s recipe note that your recipe was adapted from this person s recipe if you ve made larger changes to the recipe you could say that your recipe was inspired by this person s never use someone else s photography or illustrations since these are protected by copyright hire an editor to proofread your work edit your work several times and have others read through it as well check for accuracy of ingredients measurements cooking times etc readers will expect your recipes to turn out the way you describe so if a step is missing or inaccurate you may lose readers 7 x research source find an agent while you don t have to have an agent before you submit a cookbook proposal to a publisher having an agent can greatly improve your chances look at several of your favorite cookbooks and read through the acknowledgements the author should mention their agent contact the agent and send them a brief message about working with them 8 x research source send inquiries to a few agents since many will be busy or might have cookbook projects that are similar to your own contact publishers your agent will send information about your cookbook to several publishing houses if you don t have an agent you ll need to decide which publishers to send your cookbook or proposal to if publishers are interested in your cookbook they ll talk with you about the overall look photography gloss or matte finishes cover art of the book and publishing fees and profits 9 x research source don t be surprised if publishing houses will ask you to make changes to the structure or content of your cookbook this may be because they want your cookbook to really stand out or be easier to market create a following on social media many traditional publishers will be more likely to work with you if you already have lots of people interested in reading your book try to create a food blog that highlights some of your best work and has lots of readers give the publishers information about how many regular visitors you have to your blog as well as how many unique views you get each month consider paying to self publish your cookbook if you can t find a publishing company or want to make all of the publishing decisions yourself you can self publish your book contact a company that will publish your cookbook and discuss costs associated with printing the book 10 x research source if you want to offer a cookbook to readers on your blog you may want to publish an ebook these are simply files that your readers can pay to download you won t need to publish an actual hard copy of your cookbook if you do an ebook,Food-and-Entertaining
how to make beer batter,beer batter is used as a crispy for deep frying it seals in flavours and cooks the contents fast with hot steam resulting from the alcohol cooking off the beer root vegetables white fish minced meat hard cheeses and shellfish are all perfect for cooking in beer batter you can learn how to mix up a basic beer batter and fry with it,use one 12 oz beer you like to drink beer batter can be made with any style or variety of beer so you should feel free to experiment with different styles to see what you like best if you ve got bud lite on hand that would make for just as good a beer batter as a craft ipa generally ales and lagers are used to make beer batters the lighter and more carbonated the lighter the batter if you re not a big fan of beer flavors use a lighter lager or a pilsner darker stouts porters and ales are also perfectly fine for making beer batter and will add a malty richness to the batter sometimes these beers are significantly less carbonated so it might be a good idea to cut it with half sparkling water mix beer with equal parts of water if you want it s fine to just use beer in the batter but some people like to cut it in half with an equal amount of water to stretch the batter a bit and to save the beer for drinking with dinner while beer batter is similar in some ways to a basic pancake batter never add milk to beer batter milk added to beer will curdle unless a small amount of lemon juice is added if you re wondering the process of frying the beer cooks off all the alcohol adding more beer won t make the fried food more boozy beat in one egg into your beer mixture beat an egg directly into the liquid until it s frothy some people leave this step out and just stick to a basic beer and flour batter which is perfectly effective but beating in an egg helps to add a little body and golden richness to the batter helping it to crisp up a little more nicely whisk in all purpose flour holding your whisk in one hand start adding flour to the beer mixture a few tablespoons at a time whipping it vigorously to avoid lumps integrate all the flour you add until you add more if you use one 12 oz bottle or can of beer you ll need about 2 cups of flour to make batter this will make enough batter to coat about 20 fish fillets add 3 4 teaspoon of baking powder if you want a fluffier more cake like beer batter it s also good at this point to add about a 3 4 of baking powder like if you were making pancakes if you don t have it on hand it s also fine to leave out continue whisking in flour until the batter reaches the desired thickness depending on how much batter you re making and what you re using with it you may want it thicker or thinner depending some people prefer a thicker hearty coating while others prefer a thinner and lighter version which can be more crispy totally up to you some people suggest adding flour until the whisker can stand straight up in the bowl match the batter to complement what you re making if you re making a really light flaky fish or squash chips try to keep the batter somewhat lighter in turn 1 x research source season to taste generally beer batter is seasoned with little more than salt and fresh black pepper but you can use whatever seasonings match the dish that you re eventually planning to make if you re making fish add a little old bay or cajun spice mix to the batter if you re making vegetable chips or potato wedges try adding a pinch of curry powder or turmeric with a pinch of spice to taste set up a battering station after you ve made your beer batter and prepared the food that you re going to batter it with set up a battering station just to the side of the stove where you can drop the food into the oil and bring it out effectively if you can frying food is a little easier with a helper since it takes a lot of steps that need to happen pretty quickly to the left put your raw fish or chopped onions or other vegetables then put the bowl of batter between the food and the oil on the other side of the range have a plate waiting with some paper towels to place the fried items onto when they re done cooking it s a good idea to wear gloves and long sleeves and to pull your hair back while you re doing this it s not the cleanest process also it s a good idea to crack a window as the smell of frying oil is strong heat a half inch to an inch of vegetable oil in a sturdy cast iron skillet the best pans for frying food evenly are big cast iron skillets which will distribute the heat and offer a more even frying if you don t have one use a flat bottomed skillet with as heavy a bottom as you ve got or a deep fryer heat until the oil shimmers vegetable oil needs to be heated to 375 f 191 c to fry food in it effectively 2 x research source if the temperature is too low the batter will absorb much of the oil and will become extremely greasy and cloying if you don t have a food thermometer the best way to tell if the temperature is in the goldilocks zone is to see if the oil is shimmering on the surface it s also a good idea to add a little bit of batter by itself while the oil is heating when you see it start to sizzle quickly you will know that it s time to add the battered items to the skillet batter your food when the oil is ready and not before batter a few pieces of fish or vegetables whatever you re planning on frying and place them immediately into the hot oil make sure food is dry before dipping into wet beer batter if your fish fillets are very delicate or damp it s good to dust them lightly in flour before dipping them in the beer batter this helps fish fillets and shellfish hold the batter slightly better don t soak the food in the batter it should collect enough to create the crust just by quickly submerging it in the batter and removing it add the battered food carefully lay your food into the hot oil by dropping it away from you very gently drop one end of each fillet or vegetable in to the food and then lean it back toward the back of the skillet away from you this way the oil will spatter in that direction adding food will lower the temperature of the oil slightly so you want to be sure to avoid overcrowding the skillet you can add a few pieces depending on the size of the food you re frying but usually no more than 3 4 if you overcrowd the pan nothing will cook properly and the food will be oily when the oil is hot it will start to spit and spatter a bit even when you re not dropping stuff which means you should be extremely careful to avoid burns use a metal turner to turn the food just leave the food alone as it fries checking every minute or two for brownness on the bottom side flip the item when golden and let the other side fry cook 5 7 minutes on each side until golden brown fish and vegetables will cook pretty quickly in the fryer so they re usually safe to remove when the crust is golden brown remove them with your metal turner immediately shifting them to the plate prepared with paper towel check out other frying articles if you want to know what to batter and more specific guidelines for making fried foods check out these wikihow guides all workable with

how to remove cheesecake from a springform pan,after all the effort you put into your cheesecake don t let it crack when you take it out of the pan make sure the cake is completely chilled before you try to remove it once you lift away the sides of the pan you can take it off the base by sliding it or using spatulas to gently pick it up if you haven t baked your cheesecake yet consider using lining your pan with parchment paper to make the removal process easier see step 1 and beyond to learn each method,chill the cake overnight this crucial step will make the biggest difference in your cake s final appearance if it s still warm or room temperature when you try to take it out of the pan you ll end up with cracks and gouges in your cheesecake if you re concerned about making sure your cheesecake looks perfect don t skip this step make sure that the cake is at least room temperature or your fridge freezer will overheat loosen the sides with a knife and hot water when you re ready to serve the cake the knife and hot water trick is the best way to remove the sides of the pan take a butter knife and run it under hot water or dip it in a cup of hot water nearby run the knife along the edges of the cake against the sides of the pan this loosens the cake while keeping the sides smooth 1 x research source you ll need to wet the knife every few inches to keep it from drying and dragging against the side of the cheesecake don t use cold water as it isn t as effective as hot water using cold increases the chances that the cake will crack or break use heat to loosen the cake from the base removing a cake from the springform pan base is more difficult than taking off the sides it can help to use a source of heat to slightly heat the bottom of the cake so that the butter in the crust softens and the cake is easier to move use one of the following techniques 2 x research source a cook s blowtorch if you re lucky enough to have one in your kitchen this is a great tool for warming up the base of a cheesecake hold the pan with a potholder turn on the torch and with extreme care pass the lit blowtorch under the base this will heat the butter and soften the cheese just enough to slide the cake out of the pan take care not to overheat it a gas burner hold the pan with a potholder turn on your gas burner and carefully hold the cheesecake over the burner to heat up the bottom of the cake if you don t have a gas burner you can try a lighter again be careful not to overheat the pan it will get very hot a knife wet with hot water this is the least preferable method since wetting the crust of the cake will affect its texture if you don t have tools to directly heat the bottom of the pan this is a good option remove the sides of the pan unlatch the pan and gently lift away the sides a chilled cake will remain upright rather than slumping to one side of the other if you see any small cracks or spots that need correcting run a knife under hot water and gently smooth out the rough parts 3 x research source slide the cake onto a platter right after heating the bottom very gently slide the cake onto a platter that you have waiting right next to it if you have trouble removing the cake from the base gently push it with the flat side of a large knife to encourage it to move off the base push the crush not the soft cheese filling which is easily dented many cooks simply leave the cake on its base instead of attempting to slide it off feel free to place the entire cake base on the serving platter you can hide its edges by decorating around the cake with sliced strawberries or raspberries chill the cake overnight a cake that is warm or at room temperature will fall apart if you try to remove it from the pan it must be entirely firm before you attempt do anything with it remove the sides of the springform pan run a knife dipped in hot water along the edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the sides of the pan re dip the knife as necessary to prevent the knife from dragging at the cake after loosening the cake pop open the latch on the pan and lift away the sides don t use cold water to loosen the cake since it isn t as effective as hot water you can cover any cracks or gouges on the sides of the cake by using a knife dipped in hot water to smooth them over remove the sides of the pan unlatch the pan and gently lift away the sides a chilled cake will remain upright rather than slumping to one side of the other if you see any small cracks or spots that need correcting run a knife under hot water and gently smooth out the rough parts gather three large spatulas and a friend the spatula method requires someone else s help since the cake might break if you try to support it using just two spatulas instead of three three spatulas should be enough to lift the cake and safely transfer it to a platter choose large flat thin spatulas that will easily slide under the cake 4 x research source you may also want to heat the bottom of the cake before attempting the transfer this will make it easier for the cake to unstick from the bottom of the springform pan slide the spatulas under the cake very carefully slide them between the crust and the springform pan bottom keep sliding as far as you can and try to cover as much area under the cake as possible space the spatulas evenly around the cake so no one spot is unsupported lift the cake onto a platter hold two of the spatulas and have a friend grab the third count to three with your friend and gently lift the cake onto a platter you have waiting nearby do it quickly but carefully to achieve the best results make sure you lift at the exact same moment using the same speed or else the cake will break once you have the cake on the platter gently slide the spatulas out from under the cake line the pan with a circle of parchment paper if you haven t yet baked your cake this trick will make removing the pan much easier cut out a circle of parchment paper slightly larger than the base of the springform pan you re using press it into the bottom of the assembled springform pan you ll bake the cake on top of the parchment rather than directly on the pan this way you can just slide the bottom of the cake off the pan with the parchment which looks a lot less noticeable than a metal base 5 x research source some chefs also like to use a cardboard cutout to lend the cake a little more support cut out a piece of cardboard the same size as the base of the springform pan press a piece of parchment paper over the cardboard if you want to line the sides of the pan with parchment as well cut a strip long enough to wrap around the inside of the pan and slightly thicker than the depth of the pan now you can make your cheesecake as normal and when it is completely chilled the cake can be removed with ease from the pan bake the cheesecake according to instructions the presence of parchment won t change anything about the baking process go ahead and bake the cheesecake as usual chill the cheesecake overnight even parchment won t save a cheesecake that s still warm when you try to remove it from the pan be sure it s thoroughly chilled before you try to lift away the sides or bottom remove the sides of the pan if you didn t line the sides with parchment run a knife dipped in hot water around the edges of the cake to loosen it then unclick the pan s sides and lift them away if you did line the sides with parchment you can skip the knife trick and simply take off the sides of the pan then very gently pull away the strip of parchment to reveal the cake underneath slide the cake off the base of the pan grasp the edge of the parchment paper and gently slide the cake onto a serving plate the parchment will lift easily from the bottom of

a dark brown upon maturity before falling from the hickory tree 2 x research source the texture of a hickory nutshell may be smooth with minimal veining or considerably irregular and furrowed husks split open at the base once the fruit nut inside has fully ripened although some species partially encapsulate the hickory nut even after splitting husks vary in thickness from 2 mm to 9 mm depending on the hickory nut species measure the shells with a ruler when separate from the husk hickory nuts may measure anywhere between 0 5 inch 13 mm and 2 56 inches 6 5 cm long and equally as wide depending on the species 3 x research source examine the shape look for circular heart shaped or oblong nuts that are either slightly flat or rounded depending on the species hickory nuts can have any of these shapes 4 x research source taste the nut meat several hickory species yield a sweet edible meat while others yield bitter meat that one should not eat 5 x research source look for a densely veined inner chamber the inside of a hickory nut s shell is veined which can make it difficult to remove the nut meat 6 x research source learn about different hickory species the 16 species of hickories each product slightly different nuts find out which species live in your area so you ll know exactly what to look for and you can determine whether the nuts you find are edible 7 x research source identify shagbark hickory nuts you may find these nuts alone or in a pair they may be anywhere from 1 2 inches 3 cm to 2 inches 5 cm long and slightly less wide the brownish black husk is a medium thickness and easily splits open to reveal a light brown heart shaped textured and thin shelled fruit the kernel of the shagbark is brown and sweet 8 x research source identify southern shagbark hickory nuts the husk of a southern shagbark is 0 12 inch 3mm to 0 35 inch 9mm thick and the egg shaped shell is smooth relatively thin and easy to crack open southern shagbark nut meat is a light brown color and sweet to the taste 9 x research source identify bitternut hickory nuts the shell of a bitternut may be anywhere between 0 8 inch 2 cm to 1 6 inches 4 cm long it is a rounded light brown nut enclosed in a thin yellow scaled husk the kernel of the bitternut is bitter as the name suggests 10 x research source identify pignut hickory nuts pignuts generally mature to be about 1 inch 2 5 cm long and 0 8 inch 2 cm wide the husk is thin and dark brown and must be split manually as it rarely splits on its own the pear shaped pignut shell is thick smooth and grayish brown pignut meat is bitter and slightly bland 11 x research source identify red hickory nuts this nut measures approximately 1 inch 2 5 cm to 1 2 inches 3 cm long and 0 8 inch 2 cm wide the dark husk is about 0 08 inch 2 mm thick and splits freely on its own to reveal a light brown rounded and thin shell the meat of the red hickory is small and sweet 12 x research source identify kingnut or shellbark hickory nuts this is the largest of the hickory nut species growing to between 1 8 inches 4 5 cm and 2 6 inches 6 5 cm long and 1 5 inches 3 8 cm wide the oval shaped shell of the kingnut is very thick light brown and slightly furrowed because the shell is so thick there is little room for the meat which is sweet 13 x research source identify sand hickory nuts this is the smallest of the hickory nuts averaging between 0 5 inch 13 mm and 1 45 inches 37 mm long the husk is light brown and thin and splits only partially to reveal the shell which is oval and slightly flattened light in color smooth furry and relatively thin the kernel of the sand hickory is sweet 14 x research source identify mockernut hickory nuts the mockernut is 1 of the larger hickory nut species growing anywhere between 1 5 inches 3 8 cm and 2 inches 5 cm long and with a thick husk between 0 12 inch 3 mm and 0 24 inch 6 mm thick the mockernut shell is rectangular in shape reddish brown and smooth the meat is edible and sweet but difficult to remove because of the thickness of the shell 15 x research source break off the husks hickory nuts that are ripe will blow off the tree in a brisk wind and land on the ground with the husks already open after you collect all the nuts you want remove the husks and discard them check the nuts for nut weevil infestation nut weevils bore holes in the shells of hickory nuts and eat the meat inside if you see small holes in the nuts you might as well throw them away instead of taking the time to crack them the meat is sure to be ruined by a grub 16 x research source crack the shells most hickory nuts have tough shells that can t be cracked with a standard nutcracker you can buy a special cracker used for walnuts use a vise or crack them open with a rock try not to damage the meat inside 17 x research source if you use the rock method place a nut on a piece of flat concrete then slam the nut with a wide rock until the shell cracks it s hand to use a nutcracker to finish the job once the shell is partially open you can save the shells and burn them along with wood to help a fire last longer pick the nuts hand pick shards of shell from the nut meat so you have a clean bowl of nut halves and pieces try to save as much of the meat as you can enjoy the nuts hickory nuts can be used the same way as any other type of nut snack on them raw use them in pies and baked goods or try them roasted and salted if you re feeling adventurous try making hickory nut butter leftover hickory nuts should be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator they will keep for a few months before rotting or you can freeze the nuts for up to a year pack them tightly in freezer safe containers removing as much of the air from the containers as

how to cook bean sprouts,bean sprouts are common ingredients in many asian cuisines and are often used in salads or stir fry the most common come from mung beans which are sprouted commercially under specific light dark conditions they look like white roots attached to greenish seeds some may have brownish threads at the other end of the white root,buy the bean sprouts just before you want to cook them some foods can last a while in the fridge but the sooner you use bean sprouts the better for example if you buy loose bean sprouts by weight you will need to use them within 2 days it would be best to buy them the same day or the day before 4 x research source if you buy pre packaged ones you need to use them before the best buy date the longer you let bean sprouts sit unused in the fridge the more prone they ll be to growing bacteria choose bean sprouts with a pale color and a crisp firm texture avoid ones that look brown limp wilted or slimy you should also avoid ones that have musty smell 5 x research source make sure that your bean sprouts are refrigerated otherwise they are susceptible to bacteria they can be pre packaged or they can be sold loose by weight 6 x research source store the sprouts in the fridge separate from raw meat and seafood as soon as you get home from the store transfer the bean sprouts into the refrigerator keep them in the veggie drawer separate from raw meat including seafood 7 x research source you will be washing and cooking the bean sprouts eventually but you still want to avoid cross contamination with raw meat and seafood rinse the beans with cool filtered water before you cook them wash your hands with soap and water first then place the beans into a strainer or colander rinse the beans with filtered water then gently shake them to remove any excess moisture 8 x research source you can pinch off this wispy brown thread at the end of the root if you want to but this is not absolutely necessary 9 x research source bring 4 cups 1 l of water to a boil over medium to high heat this will be enough for 9 ounces 255 g of bean sprouts you can prepare more bean sprouts if you want to but you ll need to add more water if you are cooking more bean sprouts use enough water to cover them add the bean sprouts and cook for 1 minute and 30 seconds the water will die down when you add the bean sprouts so let it return to a boil first once it is boiling again set the timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds be sure to rinse the bean sprouts with filtered water first you can also remove the brown threads from the roots but you don t have to drain the bean sprouts in a colander jiggle the colander to drain the excess water then set the bean sprouts aside for 5 minutes so that they can finish draining if the colander doesn t have little feet to stand on set it over an empty pot instead this is important otherwise the extra moisture will dilute any sauces oils or dressings that you add use the bean sprouts in your desired recipe at this point the bean sprouts are ready to use you can chill them and toss them into a green salad or add them to a sandwich you can add them to a side dish or you can turn them into a popular japanese salad if you want to turn them into a popular japanese salad keep reading combine the onion scallion sesame seeds and garlic chop the scallion into small pieces first the thinner the better then add it to a small bowl next grind the toasted sesame seeds using a mortar and pestle and add them to the bowl as well add in 1 grated garlic clove then stir everything together if you can t buy toasted sesame seeds you ll need to toast them yourself in a dry frying pan for a few seconds peel the garlic clove before you grate it if you don t have anything to grate the garlic with use a garlic press instead stir the sesame oil soy sauce and salt into the bowl pour the ingredients into the small bowl containing the scallion sesame seeds and garlic clove stir everything with a fork until the ingredients come together this step completes the dressing for the salad you can use a different type of oil if you want to but the flavor may not be the same toss the dressing with the bean sprouts then chill for 30 minutes pour the dressing over the salad first then lift the salad repeatedly with a pair of salad tongs place the salad into the refrigerator and wait 30 minutes serve the salad immediately afterwards you can save the salad for later but eat it within 24 hours heat 1 tablespoon 15 ml of vegetable oil in a skillet tilt the skillet around so that the oil coats it evenly first then set the skillet down on the burner turn the heat up to high and let the oil heat up it s ready when it starts to bubble you can use another type of oil if you want something more flavorful such as peanut oil vegetable oil is recommended because it won t impart a strong flavor to the bean sprouts add 1 small chopped onion and fry it for 2 minutes if you have not already prepare 1 small onion by peeling the papery outer layer first then cutting off both ends chop the onion into small pieces then toss them into the skillet fry it for 2 minutes stirring it often with a wooden spatula you can omit this step if you don t like onion or replace it with 1 clove of garlic instead add 2 cups 200 g of bean sprouts and season with salt rinse the bean sprouts with filtered water first then add them to the skillet season them with a 1 2 teaspoon of salt then give them a stir if you want to you can remove the brownish threads at the ends of the white roots first sauté the bean sprouts over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes stir them often with a wooden spatula as they fry otherwise they won t cook often they are ready when they start to turn translucent and golden this will take about 3 to 5 minutes be careful not to overcook them however or they will start to turn mushy serve the bean sprouts immediately like most fried foods sautéed bean sprouts should not sit too long once they are ready slide them off of the skillet and onto a serving dish sautéed bean sprouts make a great side dish combine the peanut oil scallions ginger and garlic in a wok pour enough peanut oil into a wok to lightly coat the surface about 1 tablespoon 15 ml should be enough add 1 2 cup 50 g of thinly sliced scallions 1 tablespoon minced ginger and 1 tablespoon sliced garlic give everything a brief stir with a wooden spatula if you don t like peanut oil you can use another stir frying oil instead such as canola or vegetable fry the ingredients over high heat until they become fragrant this will take about 1 to 2 minutes stir them often with a wooden spatula so that they cook evenly and don t burn you re not quite done cooking yet so don t worry if the ingredients don t look cooked season the ingredients with salt and pepper start with a pinch of salt and a few shakes of pepper then stir the ingredients again don t worry if this doesn t seem like a lot for now you can always season the bean sprouts further later add 1 pound 450 g of bean sprouts and cook for 2 to 3 minutes rinse the bean sprouts first then add them into the wok stir them to distribute the other ingredients evenly then fry them for 2 to 3 minutes stirring often remove the little brown hairs at the ends of the white roots first do not overcook the bean sprouts or they will turn mushy serve the stir fry

space is large enough 2 x research source it is always best to visit the site in advance and draw yourself a map of the area this map can be used as a battle plan and allows you to sketch and allocate table space service routes for food service disabled access if required and exit routes as well as how you will get the equipment into place you should also mark where the power generator if required external equipment such a refrigerator ice maker barbecue or stoves etc will be as well as where power points and cables will be which may be covered discreetly with a rug and other safety hazards to address are legal and local government approvals required in most instances approvals are required for a bar but also for excessive noise vehicle access and parking building large enclosures such as a pavilion and other needs choose the amount of people to invite how many people can your budget and venue handle some events are strictly ticket entry or invitation only so it is easier to plan but many events will have latecomers or extras such as children partners or friends and keep in mind that the more guests you have the more crew you need too as it can be the biggest logistical problem it s always wise to ensure there adequate room for all people to move around at the site in older establishments they usually call the quantity of guests pax so if working in a function centre and you see pax 150 it means 150 guests are expected settle on a budget hopefully you have a few people you can lean on to gauge together how much money you ll need for this event are you paying any staff renting equipment and your venue supplying food and drinks publishing pamphlets or postcards settle on a number that seems doable and cater your plan to it you don t want to wind up paying out of your own pockets for this if you don t have to 3 x research source you may be in a situation where you can get sponsorships or donations but most of us aren t so lucky if you don t foresee any more funds coming in it s imperative that you cut corners when need be instead of having a catering team form a byo or a bring a plate function catering is minimal but you will need to provide a food table bain maries and refrigerators instead of hiring a photographer go around and take photos yourself get creative where need be assemble a team organize your service team even if they are friends and relatives or other volunteers to handle different relevant sections even if you re not professionally running an event but running a small family event good event management in a big scale is about organizing people to be in charge of individual areas of the event and making sure everyone knows what the plan is your crew needs just as much advanced noticed as the teams you re hiring and your guests assign them duties as soon as possible giving them preference if you can and try to have a few people on standby there are always a few flakes in every bunch nail down the agenda no more planning can happen until know just what s going to happen at your event when are the speakers speaking are there games activities or presentations that should be scheduled how much time will the guests need to eat work out a fairly detailed timeline for the day s activities always leave a little wiggle room no event will be exactly as you planned down to the minute people run late speeches take longer than expected the line for the buffet doesn t shuffle along you name it so while you need a good idea of what s happening understand that it s for organizational purposes and nothing is written in stone send out invitations because how else will people know to come you gotta send them invites and this isn t something you should scrimp on either your invitation is the face of your event the first impression people get of what to expect and if they should even come it s gotta be good consider your typical invitations postcards flyers etc but also go paperless email newsletters facebook twitter and sites like eventbrite that serve as invitations guest trackers and a calendar correction if you re trying to get as many people to come as possible definitely use facebook and twitter if you re trying to keep it to vips only avoid these platforms that s just asking for trouble keep track of those who have accepted you ll need a headcount to know just how much and what you all need so keep track it probably won t be the number that actually show up but it should give you a general idea websites designed for event managing can help you do this but so can facebook and an excel spreadsheet handle what you need to hire out will you need to find hire book or delegate photographers builders designers and decorators guest speakers sponsors entertainers or bands officiates or clergy dancing partners or demonstrations it is wise to include them in catering and seating calculations so that a meal and a table place is provided for them if appropriate or required too are food and beverages provided if so know who will be on the team to look after the cooking serving and cleaning what type of food do you need to serve are there likely to be guests with allergies vegetarian or vegan needs diabetics religious needs such as halal or kosher gluten free etc and will there be infants young children or the aged or injured who cannot eat solid foods are entertainment and logistics organised this part might be delivery of music equipment pavilions or tents and decorative effects or stage management you will need such as a microphone and amplifiers lighting power outlets projectors and screens for slideshows smoke machines or other stage magic effects such as mirrors banners and corporate signage etc 4 x research source if you subcontract a company to be entertainers consult with them to ensure they are able to supply and set up their own equipment as well as where the stage and service sections will be on the site and what the schedule will be this way you can find out what you may need to do to assist them caterers florists entertainers and other important people appreciate as much time as possible to plan as it is typically more expensive to obtain goods and staff for high urgency requests the other advantage is should they not be able to keep your appointment you have some time still to find an alternative find someone who will be the master of ceremonies mc the mc doesn t always organise the event entirely but they do host the event it is usually a member of the party who will organise speeches announce events such as the meal courses dancing notable guests or entertainment liaise with this person often and keep them up to date if they re any good they ll be very helpful 5 x research source sometimes you may have to be the mc in which case the job becomes much harder as you will need to keep working until it s all over it then becomes important to set up your service team with their own group leaders so you can delegate most of the normal duties to them gather your equipment when you hire a team check and double check that they re bringing the gear they need in some cases they may just be providing you bodies or goods and leaving it at that you may need to source the equipment separately it can be rented bought or even borrowed from your extensive social network go through your checklist from napkins to pa systems to extension cords decorations are a huge part of any event table linens flowers gifts candles balloons banners or backdrops for photography red carpets etc should always be sourced well in advance cover your bases one thing many rookies forget are the finer points of the facilities are there enough examples are toilets and bathrooms car parking spaces wheelchair access ramps changing rooms storage rooms and kitchen space waste disposal bins wine coolers power access etc these are obstacles that are only workable if you foresee them well in advance also think outside of your event will transport and accommodation be required for international or out of town guests or delegates at hotels as well as bookings and space made for their transport to get them to and from the event know who you re dealing with understanding the social hierarchy of your event if it s not truly yours is integral to knowing how to handle any situation as it is essential that the client has confidence in you you will need to find out who the key guests are this is usually straightforward when it is a celebration event such as the bride and groom the client is not always the key guest s but may be part of their group or not present at all who the host guests are these people often act as hosts at their own tables and tend to be good socializes and motivators of guests these people are useful to keep a convivial atmosphere and strike up a conversation if things turn quiet encourage people to dance or to introduce people to other guests to make new friendships these people should be reliable but are generally useful to know as they will keep you informed may step in and be a guest speaker or mc for you in an emergency and these are the people overall who make the event flow the smoothest at the front line who the peacemakers are you should be aware at all times who these key people are as you need to advise them of issues and involve them in the handling of issues and disputes where appropriate this will generally be the head of the family a caretaker or head honchos or hired security who the decision maker is for most cases it is yourself as manager but when you must consult guests and it is not appropriate to involve the key guests as they typically will be occupied being good hosts find out who you should consult in an emergency ultimately it would be the person who pays the bill if you re charging for your services or whomever you may deem as the client as the person having the final say on the matter get familiar with the venue well before the event it s a good idea to scope out your venue and figure out how everything will be set up you may need to make additional arrangements to accommodate the floor plan extension cords lighting etc and if it s hard to find for you it ll probably be hard to find for your guests so be sure to take that into account too if it s up to you map out where everything will go and when if there isn t room for it it needs to go talk to the venue s manager about what help they re willing and able to pitch in and if there are any city codes you need to abide by especially in the case of emergency consider making kits for your team your crews are going to be working hard in order to show them your appreciation and to keep them on top of their game make them a kit to give at the top of the event bottles of water granola bars chocolates little tokens of appreciation whatever you see fit it ll up morale from the get go too consider getting them badges or a little party favor to make them feel part of the event and to remember it by and make sure they stay fed and watered always think of your team as resources you want to be able to use in the future check in with all teams and outside parties before the event it s important to have all your ducks in a row be sure to provide clear instructions to your crew on how to get to the site and give them your number or preferably a business card with contacts to call if they need directions does anybody have any questions no and break make sure everyone is comfortable with their duties some people may not be willing to vocalize this so read them if at all possible do they seem sure and confident if not reassure them go over their duties and ask them a few basic questions when in doubt pair them with a more able partner prepare a contact list and other paperwork if necessary your own personal organization is just as important as the event s organization if you re organized and things go haywire all can still be fine but if you re not hell can break loose here s a few ways to prepare yourself make a contact sheet with phone numbers and addresses the baker thought you were picking up the cake no problem call ashley who lives nearby she can swing by the bakery on her way to the event make a checklist as teams file in you ll know what goods what equipment and what bodies are missing prepare invoices and billing as necessary the more on top of your game you are now the fewer problems you ll have later avoid last minute changes is it likely there will be frequent artistic changes weddings are infamous for clients making last minute design changes so it is wise to recommend to your clients a cut off date for changes usually 1 week before the event is leaving it very close but it gives the client some flexibility and avoids last minute changes coming too late to be practical or cost effective to implement 6 x research source if it is simple subtle or basic changes using already sourced decorations then it is not unreasonable to accede to change requests be as accommodating as possible in what is usually a very emotionally anticipated event set everything up be the first to arrive at the site to oversee the preparations make sure everyone files in accordingly and start making phone calls if not assist those who need assisting direct those who need directed and get out of the way when you need to no injuries until after the event please you ll feel a little calmer if you make a checklist have a portion for your crew a portion for hired out crews a portion for decorations and basic set up and a portion for equipment when all is checked off that s when you have time to breathe delegate do not be afraid to delegate the main stressor when it comes to an event is time to save it all hands need to be on deck or different decks if someone isn t being as useful as they could be give them something better to do it s your job it s not you being bossy or overstepping your boundaries it s you doing what you re supposed to do when you delegate be firm but polite say juan i need you over here right now to help out with the caterers thank you your crew needs to jive together as much as the event does keep everything moving swimmingly by being the leader that you need to be be flexible this means making sure that things are kept to schedule and assisting or having backup plans if it falls behind and being okay with it if you start stressing out you ll lose your head nothing good will come of that so when that speech runs ten minutes over and the speaker is ignoring your blatant distress signals or your attempt at feigning a stroke to create a diversion relax you ll just adjust the appetizer and no one will notice event intact 7 x research source things happen they do they have a bad habit of happening there s no way you can predict everything and the sooner you accept this the better a calm collected event manager can do wonders for any event a strung out tense one cannot so relax and go with the flow it ll all be over soon keep everyone updated check that guest numbers and needs are still correct on the day of the event and advise the service team of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity you should be the first set of eyes that notices if anything goes wrong consult with your clients to see how they are feeling they may be excited nervous worried bored or mentally drained or have some issue on their plate that in some cases you may soothe with understanding some kind words and practical assistance it is wise to use this time to rejuvenate the enthusiasm in guests and the team where appropriate do your thing trust and respect your service team to look after themselves if you ve given them a good base they should be fine offer assistance if needed but they should be experienced enough not to need any help at all here are a few things to keep in mind act as a concierge or receptionist at the beginning meeting and greeting each guest if appropriate as they come hand over the reins to the mc when the event starts the management role will be more active problem solving and ensuring all the back of housework such as food preparation and service runs to plan keep an eye on the guests and keep contact with the mc often and discreetly in case they want or need to change plans keep a respectful distance from the key guests after all the event is all about them but be easily accessible by checking at appropriate moments how they feel the event is going as well as any problems requests or suggestions they may have for marketing events give a takeaway you want all your guests to remember how awesome of a time they had actually you probably want more than that a visit to a website future donations word of mouth buzz whatever to ensure that your event is the legend it deserves to be give a takeaway whether it s a picture a flyer or a pen having something to remind your guests of the event is a good way to make sure you stay in their minds congratulate yourself after the event most events tend to run themselves when they start but all the hard work is the preparation that no one sees so pat yourself on the back because you deserve it okay back to tearing it down the job s not over yet after the event arrange a time to meet and thank your client it is always recommended to offer an appropriate and thoughtful gift to remember their time with you as it is these small touches that make the experience richer and may make them recommend your services in future if you gave a gift during the event such as in a gift registry with the other guests then a thoughtful after present such as flowers a framed photograph of your favourite moment at their event such as cutting the ribbon or the climax of the show or the award ceremony or the wedding kiss or blowing out the candles on a cake etc or some other gift may be appropriate clean up and get out just like mom said leave it in the same condition you found it in the same goes for your venue everything needs to be just like it was before you got there this is one business where you don t want to burn any bridges so let your crews know it s time to tear down and don t let them leave until all is taken care of and you need to pitch in too this is nice sure but it also prevents you from being billed any more than you should be many places will tack on extra cleaning fees if they find any opportunity to do so so make it as spic and span as possible to avoid the hidden costs take care of returns payments and thank all parties you may need to arrange returning hired or borrowed equipment and later on consulting with the client about their experience even if unpaid after the event thank them for the opportunity to have such a great experience to run an event with them can you get a business card of theirs thank your crew too make sure all parties are paid and all parties have paid up file receipts and get everyone taken care of you should be one of the last ones out the door and make sure it s locked behind you know how to handle late guests and other guest problems this one is a common issue so it is best to be prepared by and large delays are understandably hard to avoid such as unforeseen traffic issues and are forgiven by guests who came on time that being said here are a few things you can do to do your best to keep it from happening ensure that invitations are clear as to the time of the event and if requesting an rsvp ensure that the time is confirmed communicate with via your contact sheet the mc relevant guests often the leaders of the party members entertainers and kitchen staff as soon as you re aware of an issue you cannot resolve easily should the delayed guests be the focus such as the bride and groom the usual methods are contact the delayed guest s directly to check for an estimation advise the kitchen immediately of all developments so they can slow down or speed up to keep time refrain from making it known publicly that the event is being delayed because of certain guests because the party will work that out on their own but advise key hosts or members of the party that you have been made aware of the fact let them know what you intend to do but allow the hosts to make a suggestion as they know the members of their party and what would be appropriate in the context maintain careful watch on the time in relation to speeches if key guests are late serve an additional appetizer first course and or beverage early as this will prevent guests who came on time from becoming bored and will keep them occupied for guests that are going to be delayed for more than is reasonable or possible such as when serving food that simply cannot wait such as souffles start the event as planned and when the delayed guests arrive start them at the next course of a meal even if this is dessert organise an additional dance game speech or other form of entertainment especially music and ensure extra distractions such as group or party photographs are done until they arrive and this back up strategy should be considered the day in advance for guests deliberately arriving late it should be seen as that guest s choice not your fault as manager so your duty is first to the guests that are already present and to ensure they re looked after in a nutshell act as if there is no problem and carry on regardless know how to handle food issues this one is rare if you have planned things carefully however accidents do happen such as a guest or young child making a mess of a food table or an accident in the kitchen early on you should be aware of the type of guests so you can take into account when and where food is displayed such as for a buffet and where such guests are seated any spillage for safety reasons must be cleaned up immediately even if it means removing a red carpet or desired décor and furniture to be able to do so if it is impossible to hide a stain without affecting the appearance or the integrity of the item such as an antique then removal is wise if you have a spare then use that if not move the existing furniture or décor subtly so it does not feel missing a soft rope barrier curtain or screen is recommended whenever you need to hide the food area such as a buffet with chafing dishes or when organising a reveal of the next course as certain guests may feel that if food is in the dining area it is free for all when they want which is not always the case shuffle the menu if part of a dish is not possible to include such as a side dish that was burnt either exclude it altogether find an alternative reduce the portion sizes to stretch foods but increase portions of other foods to balance advise table hosts as required unexpected vegetarians teetotallers those with food allergies religious or special diets no surprise should ever occur with proper planning but guests occasionally do bring along additional family members partners or close friends without advising you especially if it s not a strict invitation only event this is usually easily resolved keep a headcount as guests arrive and when they arrive at the door ask if there are any food requirements and advise the kitchen and service staff immediately for large unexpected groups that are not gatecrashers send a team member to the kitchen to take stock and if necessary drive out to collect more supplies kitchens typically over cater to cover for accidents and more often there are more cancellations than unexpected guests limited portions can be stretched when you provide additional fillers such as bread rolls salad or vegetable portions ingredients for which can be quickly sourced from local supermarkets know how to deal with children it s wise to remember that many managers have made serious errors in underestimating the intelligence or forgetting the needs and desires of children at events as they have the same needs and wants as adults to have a good time and not be bored remember that their parents are also often offended if the event does not cater for their children in practice it is best to request an rsvp for every child that may come young children under 10 are best given food or snacks early as many dinner events have the meals start as late as 8pm which is far later than most children are used to food provided should be fun and healthy but as special as the adult menu as parents appreciate special touches for their children it makes their job easier so they can have fun as guests in their own right over 10 s usually are fine to be served adult food and portions even if they don t eat all of it but offer the children s menu to them with their parent s permission if they don t seem keen on the options it has also been known for young adults 13 18 to often request the same food as youngsters such as a hamburger and fries as opposed to more formal restaurant food and it has been a frequently used trick to re brand the children s menu as an alternative menu for this age group of guests it is very wise to play safe and discuss with key guests about your plans to keep the young and old engaged well in advance of the date a discrete area should be provided for mothers with young children for their needs such as toilet bathroom breaks breastfeeding etc and a place for very young children to sleep in if they are tired know how to deal with rowdy or intoxicated guests gate crashers and other guest problems ideally this would never happen but it does family or corporate events both politics and drama often come out at events that as an outsider you would not be always aware of prepare yourself ask the client or key guests before the event of the likelihood of such issues or with selected hosting guests if it is not appropriate to discuss these issues with the key guests so that way you can ensure that people are seated in places that will not cause issue enlist service staff or key guests to act as unofficial monitors to keep an eye out for issues and to step in when required strictly speaking your duty is to ensure the event is smoothly run but only where it is appropriate and to stay out of issues that are a private concern therefore you should be aware of who within the party are the peacemakers of the group as it can be a difficult job to refuse alcohol to an inebriated guest or to deal with an inebriated guest that inclines towards anger or violence it is wise to enlist a peacemaker guest and only involve law enforcement when necessary after consulting with the key guests even in small events or backyard events when alcohol is often stored in an ice box for guests to serve themselves it is equally important to be aware gatecrashers are difficult should it happen unobtrusively evict them if appropriate consult your key guests to verify that they re unwelcome for large scale and rowdy or abusive gatecrashers your duty is to protect the existing guests where appropriate and to call security or the police if they do not leave after being politely asked to do so by yourself and or the key guests guests often shuffle name cards about at the beginning where they are sitting so that they end up sitting next to people they want or at a table they want it is wise to check with the key guests how far this is permissible according to them typically you should have organised table plans in advance and have received approval from the key guests should it be that people must be at certain tables then it is wise to keep people out of the dining room altogether until time often the lobby foyer or bar area serves this purpose and if it is very important due to family issues it is wise to group people together and move them en masse to the separate tables by each host guest and service personnel to seat them in their proper order know how to handle inclement weather sudden unexpected rain or snow can be common in parts of the world likewise a heatwave or a cold front can also can pose a problem while weather events are not usually an issue if you re indoors being outside makes things difficult if bad weather is expected then consider moving the event location if the event cannot be relocated or rescheduled hire a large tent or pavilion admittedly this can be pricey on short notice keeping an eye on weather developments as you go is important very little can be done to salvage an event affected by weather so make the best of what you have 8 x research source many parts of the world now have insurance policies in the event of severe weather or other problems if you are in an area which is known for unexpectedly changeable weather it is recommended to source a quote if there may be a chance the event will have to be re scheduled as it will at least cover the client the cost of extending hire of equipment site and service personnel,Food-and-Entertaining

how to plan a picnic,picnics are a fun way to enjoy time with your family or friends outside if you re wanting to go on one planning ahead will help your event go off without a hitch choose a location and then decide what kind of food you want pack everything you need in a basket and cooler and you re ready to head off on your adventure,choose your location the location is important and it will help determine some of the other details you choose so pick it first you could go to the park the beach the mountains or even just your backyard some museums have lawns for picnicking or you could head to any area with natural attractions such as lakes or rivers 1 x research source when choosing a place do a little research if you need a picnic table make sure the the area has some you may want to check for things like bathrooms and running water too decide what time of day you want to picnic you could have a brunch picnic in the park and take breakfast foods or a lunch picnic with a friend from work alternatively opt for a dinner picnic and consider bringing foods to grill 2 x research source it s important to decide what time of day you want to have your picnic as that will affect the food you choose plan for activities often a picnic is about more than just the food see what activities the area offers so you know what you need to bring for instance if the park doesn t have much of a playground bring some fun sporting equipment with you such as frisbees or a soccer ball 3 x research source you could also bring along a board game that s fun to play outside such as twister if you re at a nature reserve consider going on a hike to a picnic spot determine who you want to invite to your picnic maybe you want to plan a picnic just for your family or maybe you want to throw a big picnic party for your friends birthday take some time to consider who you want to invite then make a list of the people you d like to come remember if you invite a lot of people you ll need to plan on bringing food for that many people unless you do a potluck with a potluck you d provide a main dish and have everyone else bring sides also think about the venue make sure it has enough tables for your group if you ll have a lot of people you may need to reserve the space for a large group create a checklist of what you need to bring with you you ll need food utensils plates a cooler activities and bags for cleanup you ll also likely want a tablecloth or blanket to spread out wherever you go 4 x research source making a checklist helps you keep track of what you need to bring so you don t forget anything make and distribute formal invitations for a bit of fun if you re inviting friends on a picnic consider sending out paper invitations inviting them to your party ask for your friends addresses and then write out invitations with the date time and details of the event you could also make them on a computer to print out either way it s a fun and festive way to get the event started if that s not your thing you can always invite them in person or over social media for an easy fix pick food that will hold up well when bounced around it s hard to keep a cooler or picnic basket perfectly stable everything is going to get a bit jumbled so skip things that require perfect presentation such as deviled eggs or even birthday cake instead try more humble foods like boiled eggs potato salad cheese and bread or carrot sticks 5 x research source opt for foods that are easy to eat don t pick foods that require a knife and fork to eat choose foods you can eat with your fingers or just a single utensil too much fussiness makes for a messy picnic 6 x research source for instance try sandwiches cottage cheese or egg salad fruits like strawberries bananas oranges or apples are also great options you could also try things like fried chicken cookies pinwheel sandwiches pigs in a blanket or burritos try fancier options if you re going on an adult picnic the foods should still be simple to eat but that shouldn t stop you from catering to more adult taste buds plenty of foods can be easily carried and eaten by hand that are more sophisticated 7 x research source for instance try bruschetta and toasted bread goat cheese and crackers or a salmon and cream cheese frittata you could also bring a variety of cheeses or dips along with crackers and chips if you want to bring salads and veggie centric dishes opt for hearty vegetables instead of leaf lettuce that way you can dress it at home and not worry about it wilting toss in a variety of drinks for hydration add bottles of water for a simple fix or you can make iced tea and pack it in reusable bottles alternatively add juice boxes sodas or flavored sparkling water for a bit of pizazz 8 x research source if you re planning a picnic for adults you could bring beer or wine but make sure it s allowed in the area you re going some water attractions don t allow glass bottles for instance while some parks ban alcohol altogether bring mini jars of condiments if you need them you don t want to waste a whole jar of mayonnaise and mustard but you ll likely need to toss anything you don t eat the end of the picnic instead opt for small jars so you ll just have what you need 9 x research source you can also pack a small amount of a condiment in a food jar you ve washed out such as a pickle relish jar that way you don t have to go out of your way to buy special mini jars another option is to save condiment packets from fast food places and bring those along 10 x research source cover all your food tightly whenever you re outside you re going to run into bugs plus you don t want your food spilling out in the cooler pack your food in tightly sealed reusable containers to keep the bugs out and the food in 11 x research source include flatware plates and bowls if you want simplicity go for disposable options that you can throw away when you re done for a more environmentally friendly option opt for nonbreakable but reuseable plates and bowls such as kids plastic plates 12 x research source remember you ll need to cart all those reusable plates back out with you don t forget napkins or paper towels too add in a trash bag or a few grocery bags to cart home dirty items and gather trash you may also want to bring hand wipes or hand sanitizer to clean everyone s hands before eating pack your basket in the order you need to take things out put nonperishable food on the bottom and any plates and flatware on top of that place the tablecloth or blanket at the very top so you can pull it out first to put on the ground or picnic table 13 x research source lay any fragile items on top so they don t break 14 x research source you can also use a plastic bin or a cardboard box to carry items put perishable food in a cooler with ice on the bottom and sides if you re bringing food that could spoil before you re ready to eat such as lunchmeat boiled eggs or fried chicken make sure to pack it in ice to keep it chilled that way your food is less likely to go bad before you can eat it 15 x research source aim to fill 25 of the cooler with ice 16 x research source for a large crowd try keeping drinks in a separate container that way people won t be letting hot air into the the cooler where the food is throw foods to grill in the cooler while they re still frozen if you re just going 10 minutes away you can skip this step however if you re traveling an hour or more try keeping your meat frozen until you put it in the cooler that way it will stay at a safer temperature for longer 17 x research source be sure to wrap any raw meat up in a package by itself before putting it in the cooler that way you re less likely to contaminate other foods pack items to deal with the weather if it s going to be chilly pack extra jackets scarves and blankets just in case if it s going to be hot don t forget hats and bug spray in either situation always carry a bottle of sunscreen you could also bring a large umbrella to protect you from the rain or sun,Food-and-Entertaining
how to sift flour without a sifter,sifting flour helps aerate the flour which allows it to mix more evenly into batter in certain recipes 1 x research source many recipes call for sifted flour but you may not have a flour sifter on hand a flour sifter while handy is largely unnecessary when it comes to sifting flour you can use a strainer or a wire whisk if you do not have either you can sift the flour with a fork sometimes people skip the sifting step if they re in a rush in some cases this can be fine but sometimes sifting flour is important recipes that require a delicate texture for example should include sifted flour,gather your materials if you don t have a sifter handy you can use a strainer to sift your flour find a strainer large enough to hold the amount of flour you need to sift find a bowl slightly larger than the strainer as you ll be holding the strainer over the bowl 2 x research source pour the flour into the strainer take the strainer with one hand as you pour make sure to position the strainer just over the bowl you re using to collect the flour 3 x research source flour is a powdery substance so it can be a bit messy make sure to pour slowly if you pour too fast the flour may get on your shirt and your work surface it s a good idea to wear an old shirt or an apron when sifting flour tap the side of the strainer until all the flour falls into the bowl be gentle as you tap you should tap with one hand and hold the strainer with the other your tapping should cause flour to lightly sprinkle out of the strainer and into the bowl the flour should be thinner and lump free as it falls into the bowl 4 x research source if the flour still has lumps in it when it falls in the bowl you re tapping too hard put the flour back in the strainer and start over it may take awhile to get all the flour through the strainer so have patience do not tap the strainer hard to speed up the process if the flour goes through the strainer too fast it may not be sifted thoroughly enough gather your supplies if you don t have a strainer or sifter you can use a wire whisk to sift the flour in addition to a wire whisk get a bowl large enough to contain as much flour as you need 5 x research source if you don t have a wire whisk you can use a fork in a pinch go for a bigger fork as this will allow you to sift the flour more efficiently stir the flour in circular motions using a fork or wire whisk place the correct amount of flour in your bowl take your wire whisk or fork and place it in the flour swirl the whisk or fork in quick circular motions you should start to see the flour even out and lose some lumps and hard spots 6 x research source if the flour is not evening out or losing lumps you may need to use faster motions have patience when stirring your flour it can take awhile to sift flour using this method especially if you re sifting a large amount of flour try not to get frustrated keep working at the flour swirling your whisk or fork in quick circular motions until the flour is light and even throughout 7 x research source when you re finished your flour should be lump free you should be left with a light even and powdery substance if your wrist gets sore it s okay to take a break from sifting for a moment figure out when to sift your flour pay attention to the wording in the recipe when sifting your flour the wording in a recipe affects how the flour is sifted there is a difference between 1 cup flour sifted and 1 cup sifted flour 8 x research source if the recipe calls for 1 cup flour sifted measure the flour first then transfer it to a bowl and sift if the recipe calls for 1 cup sifted flour sift a good portion of flour then measure out however much you need for the recipe sift flour that has been sitting in a bag for awhile you do not always need to sift flour if flour has not been sitting in a bag too long it may be light enough to simply use in a recipe when flour is in a bag for awhile however it gets compact and needs to be sifted 9 x research source if your bag of flour was squeezed into a cabinet or had another item sitting on top of it it s especially important to sift your flour make sure to sift flour for recipes with delicate textures if your flour is not tightly compact you may be able to skip the sifting process for some recipes however if you re making something that is meant to have a delicate texture always sift your flour first recipes like angel food cake for example will require sifted flour 10 x research source sift flour over a work surface before you roll or knead dough if you re going to roll out dough or knead it flour can help prevent the dough from sticking to a work surface sifted flour generally works better in this case as it will have less clumps and spread more evenly 11 x research source you should also sift flour if you re dusting flour over wax paper to roll out dough for sugar cookies,Food-and-Entertaining
how to use saffron,saffron is painstakingly hand harvested from the crocus sativus flower dried and sold as the the most expensive spice by weight adding a small amount to certain recipes can give food a rich pungent taste saffron may also offer various health and beauty benefits but the evidence is largely unverified,look for quality saffron high quality saffron is a bunch of long red strands that are bright red in color avoid powdered saffron as it s usually mixed with a lot of fillers know what flavor to expect saffron has a pungent musty taste and scent with sweet floral accents when used in excess however the taste can quickly become bitter the colour of red saffron doesn t change if you dip in water or milk saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla sweet and musky the two typically work well together but they are not similar enough to serve as strict substitutes for one another turmeric and safflower are often used instead of saffron to give foods a similar color but the flavors are much different get what you pay for harvesting saffron is a labor intensive process so if you want high quality saffron prepare yourself for an expensive purchase examine the saffron before you buy it good saffron consists of fine evenly sized threads that are deep red in color with an orange tendril on one end and a trumpet shaped flute on the other if the tendril looks yellow the saffron is likely real but of slightly poorer quality additionally a stronger scent also indicates a stronger better flavor in comparison fake saffron may look like shredded irregular threads with disconnected tendrils and pieces of bark mixed into the package the scent may not be very strong and usually smells like bark opt for whole saffron instead of ground simply put whole saffron has a stronger flavor than ground saffron ground saffron can be a good substitute if you cannot find or afford the whole spice though if you do decide to buy ground saffron go through a reputable spice seller less honest sellers may cut saffron with other spices including turmeric and paprika to reduce the overall cost store the saffron carefully saffron doesn t spoil but it will gradually lose its flavor in storage proper storage can preserve the saffron for longer periods however wrap the saffron threads in foil and place them in an airtight container store them in a cool dark place for up to 6 months for longer storage keep the container of saffron in your freezer for up to 2 years note that ground saffron should be used within 3 to 6 months and stored in an airtight container and a cool dark place crush and soak the threads the process of crushing and soaking saffron releases the maximum amount of flavor from the threads so it s strongly recommended take the saffron threads you intend to use for the recipe and crush them into a powder using a mortar and pestle if you don t have a mortar and pestle you can crumble the threads in between your fingers 1 x research source steep the crushed saffron in warm water stock milk or white wine for 20 to 30 minutes if there s any liquid in your recipe use a small amount of the specified liquid from the instructions 2 x research source add the saffron and soaking liquids directly to your recipe when called for toast the threads toasting is another common way to prepare saffron and it s especially common for traditional paella recipes place a cast iron skillet on the stove over medium heat add the saffron threads to the hot skillet cook stirring frequently for 1 or 2 minutes they should release an even stronger aroma but should not be allowed to burn cool slightly and grind the toasted saffron threads using a mortar and pestle this powder can be soaked or added directly to the recipe crumble and add directly while not ideal you can crumble and add the threads of saffron directly to the dish while you cook it if the recipe calls for a large amount of liquid note that if you use commercially ground saffron you ll typically add it directly to the dish instead of soaking it use a small amount in large qualities saffron will produce a bitter flavor it s best to prepare and use very small amounts in your dishes when possible count the threads instead of measuring them by volume note that a pinch of saffron equals about 20 medium threads and a pinch is usually enough in most recipes that serve four to six people when using powdered saffron instead of whole threads note that 1 4 tsp 1 25 ml of powder equals about 1 2 tsp 2 5 ml of threads 3 x research source this amount is usually enough for recipes that serve 8 to 12 people scale it as needed based on the number of servings use saffron in grain based recipes most traditional recipes calling for saffron are grain based including risotto pilaf and paella you can find a recipe that calls for saffron or add it to a basic recipe as a general guideline add about 30 threads of saffron to four servings of risotto or pilaf made with 12 oz 300 g of rice add 50 threads of saffron to a paella recipe that serves four 4 x research source add saffron to desserts since saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla it works well in many desserts that typically feature vanilla as the primary flavor 5 x research source this includes custard plain pastry and sweet breads for custards only add a pinch of saffron to the recipe per four servings for pastry and plain cookies use 15 to 20 threads of saffron for every 8 oz 200 g of flour called for in the recipe note that butter accents the taste of saffron better than margarine for sweet breads adding 15 threads of saffron per 1 lb 450 g of flour will create a subtle flavor but you can add up to 60 threads for the same amount of flour if you d prefer a stronger taste combine saffron with other flavors as desired if you want saffron to serve as the primary flavor in a dish you ll need to avoid adding other spices herbs or aromatics when mixed with other spices however saffron can give dishes an overall deeper flavor when mixing saffron into dishes flavored with other seasonings it s best to use only a pinch add the saffron early on so that the flavor can blend into the other ingredients more thoroughly seasonings frequently paired with saffron include cinnamon cumin almond onion garlic and vanilla for example you may see this combination in recipes for saffron rice if you plan to add saffron to meat or vegetable dishes gravitate toward those based on light meats and vegetables for example you could try adding it to a chicken or cauliflower dish do your research while saffron is most commonly used in cooking and baking it can also be used for medicinal or cosmetic purposes research the effects of saffron thoroughly before using it for non culinary purposes though early research suggests that saffron might be effective as an alternative treatment for alzheimer s disease depression menstrual discomfort and premenstrual syndrome 6 x research source there is little to no research to suggest that saffron is effective against asthma infertility psoriasis digestive trouble baldness insomnia pain cancer or other conditions avoid taking more than 12 to 20 grams of saffron since such large amounts can actually be toxic you should also avoid medicinal saffron if you re pregnant or breastfeeding or if you re suffering from bipolar disorder low blood pressure or various heart conditions take saffron extract for medicinal purposes under the guidance of a physician you could take a pure high quality saffron extract to help treat alzheimer s disease depression menstrual discomfort or premenstrual syndrome 7 x research source for alzheimer s disease take 30 mg per day for 22 weeks to improve symptoms note that this will not cure the disease however for depression take 15 to 30 mg per day continue for six to eight weeks results may be as effective as a low dose antidepressant in some individuals for menstrual discomfort take 500 mg of an extract containing saffron celery seed and anise up to three times daily for the first three days of menstruation for premenstrual syndrome take 15 mg of an ethanol saffron extract up to twice daily while symptoms last the effect usually kicks in after two menstrual complete menstrual cycles make your skin glow topical applications of saffron are traditionally used to lighten brighten and clear

how to keep cilantro fresh,if you purchase or harvest a large bunch of cilantro it can be difficult to use it up before it loses its freshness you can keep cilantro fresh for a longer period of time if you store it in ideal conditions though,trim the ends use kitchen shears to trim off the dry tip from each stem of cilantro take this time to also remove any damaged or dying leaves as well to keep the end fresher and cause less shock to the plant trim the stems under cool running water soak the cilantro place the cilantro in a dish and cover the stems with cool water let them soak for five to ten minutes 1 x research source soaking the cilantro removes all dirt and debris from the leaves since the leaves and stems will be moist when you use this method cleaning the leaves beforehand is not an issue if you were using a method that required the leaves to remain dry however you would wait until you were ready to use the herb before cleaning it remove excess water remove the cilantro from the water and transfer the bunch into a salad spinner use this device to spin the wet herbs until they feel relatively dry to the touch you can also pat the cilantro dry in between layers of clean dry paper towels or a with a clean kitchen towel make sure that the leaves are almost completely dry at least to the point that no noticeable drops of water can be spotted dripping off you do not need to air dry the cilantro extensively for this method though since you will end up wrapping the herb in damp paper towels later on it will be exposed to a little moisture anyway wrap the cilantro in a damp paper towel spread the cilantro out onto a sheet of mildly moist clean paper towel carefully wrap the herb bunch in the paper towel so that all sides are covered 2 x research source the paper towel should only be a little damp do not make the paper towel dripping wet place the cilantro in an airtight container transfer the wrapped cilantro to a plastic bag or plastic container with an airtight seal close the container and label it with the current date and contents if placing the cilantro in a plastic bag close the top seal leaving only 1 inch 2 5 cm of open space gently squeeze out all the air before you finish sealing the bag if placing the cilantro into an airtight container make sure that the lid snaps on securely and leaves no space for air to slip in or out keep in the refrigerator store the container of cilantro in your refrigerator for a week or so cilantro is a fairly delicate herb as such using this method to store fresh cilantro may not be as effective as other methods while a damp paper towel and plastic bag work well for hardier herbs like mint and parsley cilantro wilts faster according to the experiences of many home cooks methods that allow the leaves to remain dry can actually prolong the freshness of the herb longer note however that this method is very effective if you only want to keep the cilantro fresh for five days or so the combination of moisture and cool temperatures can keep the cilantro at optimum freshness and crispness for a few days but if you need to keep it fresh for a longer period of time you would be better off with another method trim the ends cut off any dry tips from the stems of the cilantro in your bunch you should also remove any old or damaged leaves at this time it is also a good idea to cut off the tough stems completely for this method the stems are not necessary since they will not be drawing in any moisture and removing them can make it easier to fit the cilantro into a tight container dry the cilantro completely if the cilantro is even a little moist you should dry it with clean paper towels or by putting it through a spin in a salad spinner 3 x research source cilantro will go bad much faster if the leaves are still wet so it is crucial that you get as much water off as possible to be on the safe side the best option is to spin the cilantro in a salad spinner and spread the stems out in a single layer on a dry kitchen towel place the towel in direct sunlight for a few hours to further dry the cilantro layer the cilantro in between layers of dry paper towel 4 x research source place a sheet of dry paper towel at the bottom of an airtight plastic container arrange a single layer of cilantro on top of it then cover the cilantro with another paper towel repeat this pattern alternating back and forth between cilantro and paper towel layers if possible only keep one layer of cilantro in a container crowding the container with too much of the herb can actually cause problems regardless of how many layers you have the bottom and top layers should both be paper towel layers snap the container shut when done make sure that the seal is airtight do not use a plastic bag instead of a plastic food storage container for this method keep in the refrigerator cover the container and place it in your refrigerator it should stay fresh for two to three weeks check the cilantro periodically during this time look through the sides of the container if using clear plastic or quickly remove the lid and peek inside if using a container made of tinted plastic remove any wilted or discolored cilantro if you notice any moisture dry the container and send your cilantro for another spin in the salad spinner trim the ends cut off any dry or damaged stem ends with a sharp pair of kitchen shears at this time you should also inspect the bunch for damaged or wilted leaves remove these leaves as well consider trimming the stems under cool running water doing so causes less shock to the herb and since the ends will be immersed in water anyway they can get wet without worry keeping the ends as fresh as possible is actually preferred since they will be able to draw up more water that way dry the leaves if necessary if the leaves have any noticeable moisture on them you should dry them off with clean dry paper towels or by running them through a salad spinner even though the stems will be wet for this method it is important that the leaves remain dry the cilantro will wither much quicker if you allow the leaves to remain wet note that for this method it is better to clean the cilantro before you are ready to use it instead of now when you are only trying to keep it fresh waiting minimizes the amount of water touching the leaves fill a glass with some water and the cilantro fill the bottom quarter of a sturdy glass jar with cool water arrange the cilantro inside the glass after that making sure that all the cut stem ends are submerged 5 x research source the cut ends should be submerged but the leaves should remain above the surface of the water if a few leaves dip under the water either reduce the amount of water in the jar or trim off the bottom leaves cover with a plastic bag place a resealable plastic bag over the top of the cilantro let the opening of the bag remain loose do not secure the bag onto the jar with a rubber band or anything else the opening of the bag should fall below the mouth of the glass in other words the leafy portion of the cilantro needs to be completely covered with the bag change the water periodically you will need to change the water every few days knowing when to change the water is as easy as simply taking a look at the glass as soon as the water starts to become discolored it is time to swap it out for a fresher water supply 6 x research source check the condition of the cilantro when you change the water snip off any dried ends or wilting leaves before returning the cilantro to the fresh jar of water keep in the refrigerator store the glass cilantro in your refrigerator when using this method cilantro can stay fresh for up to two weeks if not longer the cold temperature is just as important to

how to store brandy after opening it,nothing hits the spot quite like a smooth glass of brandy after a long day unfortunately if you aren t a frequent drinker you may not have any plans on finishing the bottle any time soon brandy technically has an infinite shelf life but the ingredients will start to deteriorate in quality after roughly 6 months so try your best to polish that bottle off within a few months after opening it if anything a nice bottle of opened brandy is just a good excuse to invite a few friends over and enjoy some drinks,close the top securely with the cap or wine stopper take the original cap and put it back in the top of the bottle if your bottle came with a cork grab a wine stopper and insert it into the mouth of the bottle keep in mind you can t reuse a cork since corks degrade over time they can also develop nasty odors and bacteria after a bottle has been opened 1 x research source there s nothing wrong with storing your brandy in its original bottle especially if you have a fancy bottle and you want to show off the label set the brandy in a dry location away from direct sunlight if you have a liquor cabinet set your brandy inside along with your other bottles alternatively you can set the brandy in a pantry on top of your fridge or in the basement aim for an area where the temperature remains stable and there isn t a lot of direct sunlight 2 x research source it helps if the brandy stays a little on the cooler side but the temperature won t impact the brandy all that much so long as your home doesn t get 80 f 27 c or hotter you don t typically refrigerate brandy but you can if you d like keep the bottle upright to keep the brandy off of the cap or wine stopper traditionally brandy is stored upright to keep the brandy from brushing against the cork which can disrupt the flavor of the liquor before it s opened it s best to store your opened brandy upright for the same reason to keep the cap or wine stopper from changing the brandy s flavor 3 x research source storing your brandy upright also decreases the odds that you end up with a spill on your hands if the bottle isn t completely sealed drink your brandy within 6 months for best results brandy doesn t technically go bad but the quality of the liquor will begin to deteriorate after 6 months have passed if you can finish your bottle within the next few months to preserve the flavors and get the most out of your brandy 4 x research source you can write the date you opened the bottle on the brandy s label if you think you may cut it close to that 6 month threshold the amount of air in your bottle may have a small impact on the quality of the brandy over time if you only have a few fingers of brandy left in the bottle try to finish it within the next 2 3 months if you really care about the flavor you may not notice a huge impact if you drink it after 4 5 months though select a cool decanter to display your brandy with style if you have a nice decanter this is the best way to display your brandy if you want a more aesthetically pleasing presentation take your decanter out of storage or take it off of your bar and set it out on your countertop wash your decanter out and let it air dry if you haven t used it or cleaned it in a while 5 x research source a decanter is designed to help open up wine by exposing it to a small amount of oxygen this process doesn t do anything for brandy the only reason to use a decanter is if you don t like random bottles sitting out around your home if you have a cheaper bottle of brandy a nice decanter is a great way to present your brandy without tipping others off that you re drinking the cheap stuff pour the brandy into the decanter carefully and close the top open the top of your decanter and remove the top of your brandy hold the neck of your brandy against the rim of the decanter s mouth slowly and carefully tilt the bottle up and pour your brandy into the decanter empty your bottle out and discard it then put the cap on your decanter and check the seal around the cap to make sure the bottle is airtight 6 x research source if your brandy came in a dark bottle set a small light down next to the decanter before pouring your brandy this will make it much easier to see the neck of the bottle as you pour you can use a clean funnel to make pouring easier if you d like set the decanter on your bar or in a visible location to show it off choose a prominent highly visible location to show off your decanter the bar is the traditional option but a liquor cart or a small table is great choice as well if you can keep the decanter out of direct sunlight to keep the quality as high as possible 7 x research source drink your brandy in the next 4 6 months for ideal taste brandy will start to deteriorate after 6 months and the decanter has a small chance of letting some air into your liquor in addition a decanter won t keep light from disrupting the ingredients the way a dark bottle will keeping this in mind your brandy may start to turn a little faster than it normally would in the original bottle try to finish your brandy within 4 months to enjoy it while it s still good 8 x research source your brandy may still be perfectly fine if you don t get to it in 4 months you may not notice much of a difference anyway you will almost certainly taste the difference if you wait more than 6 months though a small amount of brandy may deteriorate a little faster than a nearly full decanter if your decanter isn t particularly full try to finish the brandy in the next 2 3 months toss your brandy after 1 year if you want a decent tasting drink an opened bottle of brandy will be pretty hard to drink after 1 year has passed so you re better off pouring it down the drain if you d prefer to not drink soured brandy it isn t dangerous to drink old brandy if it has been opened but the odds are low that you ll get much enjoyment out of it 9 x research source the high alcohol content of brandy keeps it from developing bacteria or mold but oxidation can break down some of the ingredients and damage the flavor once the brandy is exposed to air the ingredients essentially start turning this takes a long time to happen but the oxygen will eventually ruin any non alcoholic ingredients in your liquor assume the brandy is still good if it s been less than 6 months if it hasn t been more than 6 months and you weren t storing the brandy in the sun or in an unopened container your brandy is almost certainly going to be tasty even if it doesn t taste brand new you can skip all of the guessing smelling and inspection and jump right to the drinking if you haven t had the bottle for more than 6 months 10 x research source smell the brandy to assess the aroma if it s been 6 12 months appraising whether a brandy has soured or gone flat is largely a guessing game but you can generally tell if the brandy is good or not just by smelling it open the top and take a sniff of the liquor if it smells smooth fruity spirited and sweet you re good to go if you smell anything else your brandy may have started to deteriorate 11 x research source brandy is made out of distilled wine but there may be a variety of other ingredients and fruits added to your specific brandy there is no iconic brandy smell the way there is for gin vodka and bourbon so you may have to trust your gut a little taste a small sip to see if the flavor is pleasant as a final test if you still aren t sure if the brandy is good or not a taste test is in order pour 1 2 teaspoons 4 9 9 9 ml of your brandy into a glass and take a small sip if the brandy tastes fine to you it s time to enjoy if it tastes terrible just pour it out if it doesn t taste phenomenal but it still feels drinkable some mixed drinks may be in order 12 x research source mix the brandy into some cocktails if it s a little off but still fine if you re on the fence about drinking your brandy and pouring it you can mask the flavor of the slightly off brandy with some additional ingredients brandy is a great base for a brandy manhattan sidecar pisco sour or jack rose you can also mix the brandy with some coke lemonade or sweet tea for a simpler option 13 x research source this is probably your best bet if the brandy isn t in pristine condition but you know you ll feel guilty about pouring an expensive bottle down the drain mixers and cocktail ingredients should mask some of the more questionable notes in the brandy,Food-and-Entertaining

how to replace salmon,salmon offers a lot of great health benefits like omega 3 fatty acids and protein but it can be a little pricey isn t always available and has a robust taste that some people don t enjoy whether you re concerned about the sustainability of salmon farming dislike the flavor or odor or are looking for less expensive options there are some great alternatives to explore you may even be surprised to find a new favorite fish to add to your meal rotation,choose a cut of fish that is about the same size that the recipe calls for this should help prevent your fish from turning out over or under cooked so if the recipe asks for a 1 inch 25 mm thick fillet or a 5 oz 140 g piece of fish do your best to pick a substitute that is similarly sized 1 x research source if the recipe calls for skin on salmon make sure your replacement fish has its skin on too substitute arctic char for salmon if you d prefer a less fishy tasting fish arctic char is technically a member of the salmon family and it has a high fat content which makes it a hardy piece to use in all kinds of recipes whether you broil grill bake poach or even smoke it arctic char is an excellent alternative to salmon 2 x research source arctic char also tends to be more eco friendly than salmon and it s low in mercury 3 x research source try roasting a piece of arctic char and pairing it with an orange lentil salad 4 x research source pick yellowtail if the recipe calls for bright fresh ingredients yellowtail goes great with ingredients like avocado mango lemon lime scallion cilantro or parsley it has a relatively mild flavor and is high in protein and omega 3 fatty acids you can grill sauté steam bake or broil yellowtail like you would a piece of salmon 5 x research source yellowtail is a popular choice in sushi and is great raw but it s also wonderful when cooked if you see it on sale at the store or can get some fresh from a fishmonger give it a try in place of salmon try bluefish if you like oilier tasting fish bluefish has a dominant flavor so if you enjoy the taste of salmon and are looking for new types of fish that can provide a similar punch try bluefish because of its strong flavor it doesn t need much other than a spritz of citrus and a sprinkling of fresh parsley after being grilled roasted or baked 6 x research source bluefish does tend to have a slightly higher mercury content than other types of fish if you enjoy it try to limit yourself to 3 servings a month or 2 for children 7 x research source if you want to fry bluefish choose a smaller cut larger ones tend to be too oily and don t turn out well when fried to cut down a little on the oiliness try spreading a citrus based aioli over the bluefish before cooking it swap out smoked salmon for smoked mackerel for an omega rich option mackerel has a nice strong flavor that transfers well even when it s smoked at high heat use it on a bagel with cream cheese and capers as a salad topping with fried eggs or mixed into a potato salad 8 x research source mackerel can also be baked broiled grilled and poached just like salmon it doesn t hold up when it s fried or steamed though because of how oily it is mackerel can be high in mercury look for atlantic mackerel or atka mackerel for low mercury options and steer clear of king mackerel if you can use mahi mahi if you like a lighter milder fish that is easy to fry mahi mahi is generally less expensive than salmon and it has a much milder flavor it s lean yet firm and is an excellent vehicle if you have other ingredients that you want to shine pair it with a flavorful sauce or fry it up for fish tacos 9 x research source mahi mahi has moderate mercury levels and is generally safe to enjoy 4 or more times a month for the most eco friendly fish look for mahi mahi that comes from fisheries 10 x research source branch out and try tilefish or wahoo for options that don t taste very fishy rather than just having a mild fish flavor these two types of fish tend to taste more like other foods specifically tilefish tastes more like lobster or crab and wahoo tastes more like chicken or veal 11 x research source tilefish tends to be firm and flakey once it s cooked it has a mild taste and does best when it s baked broiled fried poached or sautéed try marinating wahoo in a flavorful sauce before broiling grilling poaching sautéing or smoking it use chicken as a replacement if salmon isn t available at the grocery store also chicken is a great substitute if you re working on a new recipe and don t want to spend extra money on salmon until you ve perfected the rest of the course just remember to cook the chicken longer than you would the salmon so that it reaches a safe temperature 12 x research source chicken should have an internal temperature of 165 f 74 c make or buy a vegan or imitation fish fillet find faux fish fillets at your local grocery store in the frozen foods section if you re making your own at home try adding seaweed kelp flakes and a little bit of lemon juice or zest for flavors that are reminiscent of fish 13 x research source chickpeas or tofu are great bases for imitation fillets they easily bind together with other ingredients well so that the consistency is similar to that of a fish if your regular supermarket doesn t carry this option check out an asian grocery store grill a tofu fillet and serve it in place of salmon like salmon you can cook tofu so that it has a great seasoned exterior and a soft tender interior slice off 1 in 25 mm wide pieces of tofu and pat them down with paper towels to remove excess moisture marinate the tofu with whatever your recipe calls for and cook them for about 20 minutes over indirect heat on a well oiled grill 14 x research source when picking tofu out at the grocery store choose firm tofu non silken if you can find it it ll absorb more juices and sauce from the rest of your dish top the grilled tofu with more marinade or with fresh salsa for brighter flavors this is a great option if you re having someone over for dinner who doesn t eat fish and prefers a vegetarian option you can make the same dish for everyone and just sub a tofu fillet for the fish use tempeh as a great flavor vehicle that will still hold some texture tempeh is generally made from fermented soybeans and is full of lots of protein and fiber it tastes a little like nuts and mushrooms and it can be grilled fried or even ground to use in faux salmon cakes 15 x research source you can usually find tempeh at your local grocery store but you may have to visit a health food store depending on where you live check the refrigerated section near the tofu enjoy similar health benefits from a vegetarian walnut burger they won t taste like fish at all but

how to store chewing gum,buying chewing gum in bulk can save you money but only if you store it properly so it remains chewy and flavorful fortunately packaged chewing gum stays fresh for several months if not longer when kept in a cool dry dark place however if you happened to invest in some chewing gum art or made some of your own be warned that it s really difficult to permanently preserve used chewing gum 1 x research source,keep the gum in its original packaging gum is packaged to maintain freshness so it makes sense to keep it that way until you re ready to chew it if your gum package is sealed in a plastic overwrap keep the overwrap in place until it s time to grab a piece of gum from the package 2 x research source gum comes packaged many different ways from plastic bags to metal tins to paper cartons to name just a few however your favorite gum is packaged leave it as is as much as possible seal your gum packages in one or more airtight containers if the gum package is already sealed up in a plastic overwrap this step is probably overkill however if you ve already opened the gum package storing it in a jar or other airtight container can help keep your gum fresh and flavorful 3 x research source keeping different flavors of gum in the same sealed container may cause the flavors to mingle in unpleasant ways if you like both cinnamon and spearmint gum for instance you should probably store them separately stick the gum in a cool dry dark place most types of gum start to soften at around 80 f 27 c and get really soft in environments above about 95 f 35 c like in your mouth for the best results aim for these storage conditions a temperature between about 50 75 f 10 24 c average indoor humidity around 50 and cover from direct sunlight 4 x research source a pantry cupboard or coat closet can make a good storage spot for gum bad storage choices include a jar on the windowsill or a kitchen cupboard right up against the oven don t store gum in the fridge or freezer cool is good for gum storage but cold may cause more harm than good gum that has been stored in a refrigerator or especially a freezer usually becomes brittle and difficult to chew gums that are encased in hard shells may fare a bit better than stick gums but room temperature storage is usually superior in all cases your freezer is however very useful in helping to remove gum from fabrics chew the gum within 8 10 months for the best flavor and texture the sooner you open a pack of gum the softer chewier and more flavorful it will be that said even a gum connoisseur is unlikely to notice much difference between a newly bought stick of gum and one that s been properly stored for 6 months in general you won t notice any difference in quality for at least 8 10 months after purchase 5 x research source throw out the gum if it looks or smells bad you re unlikely to come across moldy or rotten chewing gum but it s possible in some cases trust your senses before putting any questionable piece of gum in your mouth if you see splotches or discolorations or smell any off odors toss the entire package of gum in the trash 6 x research source if the gum looks and smells okay but has an off taste once you put it in your mouth spit it out and get rid of the whole pack it s much more likely that the gum in an old package will become dry brittle and unpleasant to chew while you can try to soften it up with some assertive chewing buying new gum is probably your best bet don t toss out gum just because it s past its best by date remember that chewing gum rarely goes bad in the sense that it might cause you harm generally its quality just goes downhill over time the best by date is only an estimate by the manufacturer about when this decline in quality will happen if the gum still looks and tastes fine go ahead and chew it 7 x research source some gums may be perfectly fine for months after the best by date while others may decline in quality shortly afterward but even as the quality fades it s extremely unlikely that the gum will become a possible source of foodborne illness store nicotine gum according to its specific instructions the storage instructions for chewing gum and prescription medications are similar in several respects it s usually best to store them in a cool dry dark place not surprisingly then this is the general storage advice for medicated nicotine gums used for smoking cessation always follow the specific storage instructions on the package though 8 x research source the package may give you a maximum temperature for example 77 f 25 c at which to store the gum storing the gum improperly may impact the potency and effectiveness of the medication keep your gum in a purse or bag instead of your pocket while it s convenient to stash a pack of gum in your pants pocket your body heat may cause the gum to become overly soft sticky and deformed in some cases the softened gum may ooze out of the packaging and get stuck to the inside of your pocket 9 x research source a shirt pocket is a slightly better choice than a pants pocket but it s still possible that your body heat may make the gum soft and sticky generally speaking try to keep packaged gum at or below 80 f 27 c store gum in a shady spot in your vehicle during hot weather a sunny location in your vehicle can easily reach 130 f 54 c or higher on a summer day which is plenty hot enough to turn your gum into sticky goo keeping your gum in a shady location like the glove box or center console is more likely to keep it under about 90 f 32 c 10 x research source alternatively during the winter the temperature inside your car may fall below 32 f 0 c and cause your packaged gum to turn brittle and unpleasant to chew so you may just want to keep your gum package with you instead of leaving it in the car save the gum wrapper for disposal or short term storage if you need to remove a piece of gum from your mouth the most sanitary option is to spit it out into its wrapper wrap it up and throw it in the trash if you really want to put the gum back into your mouth after you take a drink or make a phone call it will probably stay soft in the wrapper for a good 5 minutes but why not just chew a new piece of gum instead don t stick your used gum on the wall under a desk or anywhere else but the trash that s unsanitary and just plain gross and assuming that you don t like stepping in gum yourself don t throw your own used gum on the ground see if gum recycling is available in your area some cities have run trials that involve setting up gum recycling boxes for used chewing gum if this is happening where you live go ahead and put your unwrapped used gum in the marked box instead of in the trash 11 x research source don t worry recycling doesn t mean that your old chewing gum is turned into new chewing gum instead the used gum and the recycling box are turned into a plastic product that can be molded to shape for various

how to stop oat milk from going slimy,oat milk is a dairy free type of milk that you can easily make at home it s a great alternative for people who can t drink dairy or nut based milks one issue people sometimes have when they make homemade oat milk is that it ends up with a slimy texture which makes it less appealing than creamy store bought oat milk luckily there are ways to make non slimy oat milk at home that tastes just as good as what you can find in a store the keys to slime free oat milk are the proper blending and straining techniques,put 1 cup 90 g of rolled oats in a blender measure out the oats using a dry measuring cup and pour them into the blender avoid using quick oats because they absorb water faster and are more prone to going slimy 1 x research source rolled oats are also sometimes called old fashioned oats or whole oats use organic rolled oats for the healthiest option you can use any type of blender you have available though high powered blenders are the best because they chop the oats up evenly more quickly don t use a food processor because you will probably have to blend the oats longer to get an even consistency which makes them slimy pour 4 cups 960 ml of cold water into the blender use a liquid measuring cup to measure out the water and pour it into the blender on top of the oats never use warm or hot water because heat makes oats starchy and gummy so it will result in slimier oat milk 2 x research source the colder the water the better if you have ice water such as in a fridge with a water dispenser use that instead of cold tap water don t let the oats soak in the water finish adding the rest of the ingredients and blend the oat milk as quickly as possible soaking oats is another reason oat milk goes slimy dump 1 4 tsp 1 25 g of salt into the blender measure out the salt using a measuring spoon and pour it into the blender this pinch of salt helps give the oat milk a creamier more savory texture and flavor 3 x research source you can use either regular table salt or kosher salt for this add maple syrup and vanilla extract if you want sweetened oat milk use a measuring spoon to measure out 2 tbsp 30 ml of maple syrup and 1 tsp 4 9 ml of vanilla extract and add them to the blender skip this if you want unsweetened oat milk 4 x research source you could use honey instead of maple syrup to sweeten your oat milk whether or not you add sweetener shouldn t affect whether the oat milk turns out slimy blend the mixture immediately for 20 30 seconds at high speed turn the blender on to the highest speed setting stop the blender as soon as the oats are well blended and don t let it run for any longer than 30 seconds 5 x research source pay close attention during this step and stop the blender within 20 30 seconds once the oats are broken up and mixed with the water if you blend the oats too long the heat and friction from the blender can make them slimy place a nut milk bag into a large measuring cup a nut milk bag is a tightly woven bag that is specially designed for straining nut milks so it works perfectly for oat milk as well place the bag into a measuring cup with a capacity of at least 4 cups 960 ml so it can hold all the milk you strain out 6 x research source you can purchase a nut milk bag online for under 10 usd as an alternative to a nut milk bag you can place some cheese cloth over a fine mesh strainer and pour the milk through that don t use a strainer or a piece of cheese cloth on its own because the weave is not tight enough and too many oat particles will get through if you don t have a big enough measuring cup you can use a large glass jar or any other convenient container that can hold all the milk pour the mixture into the nut milk bag in the measuring cup hold the nut milk bag open with 1 hand and grab the blender in your other hand carefully pour the oat milk mixture out of the blender into the bag 7 x research source if you need both hands to maneuver your blender you could also fold the edges of the nut milk bag over the rim of the measuring cup to keep it open or get a helper to hold it open for you press the milk out from the oats by applying light pressure with your hands lift up the nut milk bag carefully and let the milk start draining out into the measuring cup apply very light pressure to the sides of the bag by squeezing it gently between your hands to help push the milk through but don t squish the oats 8 x research source squeezing the mixture too hard is another reason oat milk can end up being slimy try to strain as much of the milk out as possible with the least effort the less you squeeze on the mixture the creamier your oat milk will be store the milk in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 5 days pour the strained oat milk into a sealable glass jar or other sealable container and close it up put it in your refrigerator and use it within 5 days 9 x research source for example mason jars are perfect for storing oat milk you can tell when oat milk goes bad because it starts to smell funny avoid heating the oat milk before you use it which causes it to thicken remember that heat is the enemy of oat milk just take the oat milk out of the fridge and shake it up vigorously before you use it 10 x research source it s normal for your oat milk to separate in the fridge shaking it up will mix everything back together,Food-and-Entertaining

how to store dry vermouth,vermouth in both its dry and sweet varieties is a fortified wine that s great to drink on its own or in cocktails unfortunately vermouth s flavor goes downhill quickly once you open the bottle to maintain the quality of an open bottle for 1 month or perhaps a bit longer always keep your vermouth tightly sealed in the refrigerator unopened bottles on the other hand can be stored in a cool dry dark place for up to 3 years,buy a bottle with a best by date no more than 3 years in the future because it s a fortified wine vermouth doesn t get better with age like unfortified wines even when stored unopened in ideal conditions vermouth s flavor profile suffers after 3 4 years therefore any vermouth bottler that adds a best by date more than 3 years in the future is being overly optimistic 1 x research source high quality vermouth makers are very unlikely to use best by dates that are more than 2 3 years in the future they know that their product won t be at peak freshness beyond that point if the bottle doesn t have a best by date write down your own one on the bottle by adding 2 or 3 years to the date of purchase store the bottle upright in a cool dry dark place in many homes an enclosed pantry cupboard is a perfectly fine storage spot for an unopened vermouth bottle if that s not an option for you get creative looking for a cool dry dark spot for instance maybe a coat closet will do 2 x research source if you have a wine fridge or wine cellar it s certainly fine to keep your vermouth there but it s not necessary to get one of these just to store your vermouth open the bottle by the best by date or within 3 years of purchase if you re looking for maximum flavor and freshness remember that the clock is ticking the sooner you open and finish the bottle the better the results that said the average vermouth fan likely won t be able to taste the difference between a bottle that s been stored properly for 1 year versus 2 years 3 x research source vermouth only becomes unsafe to drink if you see moldy deposits floating in the liquid and or smell a moldy aroma otherwise it s safe to give the contents of an expired bottle a little test sip but it may taste like vinegar put an unopened bottle in the fridge to buy a few more months of freshness if you find a bottle you forgot about that s at or near its best by date putting it in the fridge will slow down the decline in flavor and quality go ahead and add 3 6 months to the best by date in this case 4 x research source if you have room in your refrigerator to store vermouth there from the time of purchase until you open it you can add a full 6 months to the best by date but even in this case the sooner you open and use the vermouth the better close the lid tightly after each use to maintain freshness most vermouth brands use bottles with metal screw top caps assuming that you and your friend don t manage to finish the whole bottle after opening it screw on the lid so it s hand tight as soon as possible 5 x research source just like with unfortified wines oxidation does bad things to the flavor of vermouth restricting oxygen circulation in and out of the bottle is essential if your vermouth bottle uses a cork or some other type of stopper use a tight fitting stopper to keep the bottle as well sealed as possible store the bottle unrefrigerated only for immediate use or cooking even if you enjoy using vermouth in your favorite cocktails don t store an open bottle in your liquor cabinet if you absolutely can t keep the open bottle in the refrigerator use it up within 1 month at most but ideally within a week 6 x research source the only exception is if you re cooking with dry vermouth as a substitute for white wine if you re using it exclusively for this purpose you can keep an open bottle unrefrigerated for up to 6 months without a noticeable decline in quality it s rare for vermouth to go bad in the sense that it might make you ill in the rare case that you see or smell evidence of mold discard the vermouth right away otherwise the main problem will be that the vermouth just won t taste very good stash the bottle in the fridge to slow unwelcome changes in flavor once you crack open the vermouth bottle the fridge is your friend refrigeration slows down oxidation and the general decline in flavor that occurs once the bottle is open any spot in the fridge top shelf bottom shelf door etc will do 7 x research source don t put vermouth in the freezer though freezing causes other types of unpleasant flavor changes use up the chilled bottle within 1 month or 2 3 months at most refrigeration buys you more time but it won t stop your vermouth s flavor decline as always the sooner you can finish an open bottle the better flavor you ll get 8 x research source after up to 1 month in the fridge you probably won t be able to taste any difference after 1 2 months you ll likely notice a slight to moderate decline in quality after 2 3 months your dry vermouth will taste ok at best undrinkable at worst sweet vermouth keeps longer than dry vermouth in the fridge so add 1 month to each of the above storage suggestions try storage alternatives if you like but don t expect miracles because vermouth is so popular in cocktails yet it s also hard to finish an entire bottle quickly people are always looking for a new best way to maintain its flavor in truth simple refrigeration seems to be the best option that said you may want to try one of the following out of curiosity 9 x research source after opening the bottle transfer the remaining vermouth into one or more smaller glass bottles in theory using smaller bottles reduces the amount of oxygen trapped with the vermouth thus reducing oxidation for safety clean and sterilize any bottles you use buy a device that pumps inert gas into the bottle thereby forcing out the oxygen and presumably preventing oxidation you can find these devices wherever wine gadgets are sold enjoy the flavor of dry vermouth all on its own while great in cocktails a good quality dry vermouth is wonderful to enjoy on its own add a few ice cubes to a glass and pour in about 3 fl oz 89 ml of dry vermouth finish it off with a lemon slice or skewered olive if you wish 10 x research source sweet vermouth has a somewhat different flavor profile but is definitely also worth trying on its own make a quick vermouth spritzer with some plain carbonated water this is a simple but refreshing way to enjoy vermouth pour equal parts of chilled dry vermouth and chilled carbonated water in a glass and that s it 11 x research source in spain soda water is often served alongside your vermouth order whip up a few tasty cocktails that feature dry vermouth it s easy to find many cocktail recipes online that include dry vermouth the classic martini is probably the most famous option but you can also get a bit creative and try the martini variation called the gibson 12 x research source stir together 2 5 fl oz 74 ml of gin and 0 5 fl oz 15 ml of dry vermouth in a glass with ice strain the mixture into a cocktail glass then add a cocktail onion as a garnish,Food-and-Entertaining
how to remove eggplant seeds,eggplant or aubergine is a versatile vegetable that can be used to make many types of dishes the middle of an eggplant has a soft pulpy core that holds its seeds you don t have to remove the seeds to eat an eggplant but they do sometimes have a bitter flavor that you might like to get rid of before cooking the eggplant you can also harvest and save the seeds to grow your very own eggplant discard the seeds if all you re doing is removing them before cooking or separate the seeds from the pulp using water if you want to keep them for your garden,remove the seeds if you want to decrease the bitterness of your eggplant the seeds are what hold most of the bitter flavor in an eggplant you don t have to remove them but if you prefer your eggplant to be less bitter go ahead and get rid of them 1 x research source older eggplants have more seeds and are thus more bitter seeds that are turning brown also tend to be more bitter if you re using small young eggplant you might not have to remove the core because it won t have a lot of seeds or bitterness anyways slice your eggplant in half lengthwise place the eggplant on a cutting board and hold it still with your non dominant hand carefully slice it in half lengthwise using a sharp kitchen knife with your dominant hand 2 x research source be careful not to cut towards the hand that is holding the eggplant steady always keep your fingers out of the way of your knife if you want round slices of eggplant for your recipe you can go ahead and cut it into slices instead of horizontally scrape out the seedy core using a metal spoon hold half of the eggplant in your non dominant hand and hold a metal spoon in your dominant hand with your thumb pressed against the handle near the head of the spoon and the curved part of the spoon facing down stab the tip of the spoon into the top end of the seedy core then drag the spoon down along the flesh to scrape the soft core out repeat this for the other half of the eggplant 3 x research source if you cut your eggplant into slices instead of horizontally you can slide the edge of the spoon or the tip of a knife around the soft core of each slice to remove the seeds instead of scraping them out use your kitchen knife to slice or cube the eggplant flesh you will now be left with just the seeded flesh of the eggplant cut and cook the eggplant according to what your recipe calls for 4 x research source you don t have to remove the skin to cook and eat eggplant scoop the seeds out of an eggplant into a bowl of water fill a bowl with clean cool water slice an eggplant lengthwise on a cutting board using a sharp kitchen knife hold a metal spoon with your thumb near the base of the handle and use it to scrape out the soft seedy core from each half of the eggplant into the bowl of water keep scraping until all the pulp and seeds are in the water 5 x research source the bowl of water will help you separate the seeds from the core s pulp use your fingers to rub the seeds off the pulp and into the water grab pieces of pulp and rub them firmly between your fingertips under the surface of the water to separate the seeds from the pulp keep doing this until you clean all the seeds off the pieces of pulp and the seeds are floating around in the water 6 x research source there may be some seeds that are more deeply embedded in pieces of pulp that you can t get out just by rubbing them you can try to dig them out if you want or you can just do the best you can and rub the majority of the seeds off pour the water out through a mesh strainer and rinse the seeds with water pick out the big firm chunks of pulp from the strainer until you re left with just seeds and soft pulp blast high pressure water from a sink or hose through the strainer until all the soft pulp gets pushed through and there are only seeds left 7 x research source make sure the strainer you use is made of fine mesh so the seeds don t slip through it dry the seeds for 1 2 days in a well ventilated area dump the seeds out onto dry paper towels or newspaper and pat them dry transfer the seeds to a clean dry plate and spread them out evenly leave them to dry for 1 2 days 8 x research source if the seeds stay too wet they might germinate make sure you soak up all the excess moisture with paper towels or newspaper before you transfer them to a plate any dry well ventilated place is fine to leave your seeds to dry try to keep them out of direct sunlight so they don t get cooked store your dried seeds in a clean dry container for up to 5 years transfer the seeds to something like a jar envelope or sealable baggy and seal the container keep them somewhere cool and dry and they will be good for up to 5 years 9 x research source it might be a good idea to label the container with the date you stored the seeds so you know how long they are good for,Food-and-Entertaining
how to prevent tapioca from hardening,tapioca pearls are used to make the ever popular taiwanese drink called boba tea or bubble tea it s a lightly sweetened drink made with tea and milk poured over round soft chewy pearls of tapioca the chewiness of these pearls is key to what makes the drink so well liked hard crunchy boba would ruin the experience you can keep the pearls soft by storing them in simple syrup just make sure to use them within a few days before they start to naturally harden,cook your tapioca pearls according to the instructions on the package in general you ll use about 6 8 cups 1 400 1 900 ml of water for 1 cup 150 grams of dry tapioca pearls using enough water is important because the pearls will absorb tons of water while they cook not using enough could cause them to turn gummy and stick together 1 x research source the tapioca normally cooks in boiling water for 15 minutes before you remove the pot from the heat then you usually need to let the pearls sit in the water for an additional 15 minutes the instructions might differ depending on the size of the pearls or whether or not you re using quick cooking tapioca always check the instructions to make sure you re preparing it properly make a simple syrup while the tapioca pearls are cooking in a small saucepan combine 1 cup 240 ml of water and 1 cup 198 grams of white sugar bring the mixture to a boil and let it cook until all the sugar has dissolved then remove the pan from the heat 2 x research source if you like vanilla you could add 1 teaspoon 4 9 ml of vanilla extract to the simple syrup once it has been removed from the heat this will infuse the tapioca pearls with a light vanilla flavor drain the tapioca to remove the excess water place a colander in the sink and carefully pour the cooked tapioca into it try to pour so that the pot is facing away from you to protect your face and arms from the hot steam once the tapioca is in the colander give it a good shake to jostle off any remaining water 3 x research source always be careful when working with hot water wear oven mitts when you pick up the pot if it s still hot to the touch and pour slowly so you re less likely to get splashed transfer the cooked tapioca into a glass jar or bowl don t wait and let the tapioca sit in the colander it could start to stick together which isn t what you want simply pour the pearls into the container make sure it s large enough to leave about 1 2 inches 25 51 mm of headspace at the top 4 x research source make sure the container you re using is clean before you put the tapioca into it you don t want any cross contamination happening to your boba cover the tapioca pearls with the simple syrup you made earlier the simple syrup will help keep the pearls soft until you re ready to use them stop the pearls from sticking together and infuse them with a lovely sweet flavor after you pour the simple syrup in give the bowl a quick stir with a spoon to make sure all the pearls are covered 5 x research source the tapioca pearls should be completely submerged in the syrup if you need more make another batch to add to the container store the tapioca in the fridge and use it within 1 2 days after a few days the tapioca will start to harden and the consistency won t be as chewy as you d like you may be able to use it on the third day still but test a pearl before making your drink to ensure it s still chewy 6 x research source if your container has a lid use it if not cover the container with plastic wrap this should help the tapioca dry out less quickly uncooked dry tapioca can be stored in your cupboard for 12 months 7 x research source make a strong cup of your favorite tea the beauty of boba is that you can tailor it to whatever flavor you prefer you could make green tea black tea jasmine tea mint tea oolong tea or even matcha tea bring 1 cup 240 ml of water to a boil and add 1 2 teabags of your preferred tea let it steep for about 15 minutes before removing the teabags 8 x research source remember that you ll be adding ice boba and perhaps some milk to your tea so you want it to be extra strong if you want to enjoy boba tea regularly you could make an entire pitcher of tea and keep it in the fridge so that you always have some ready to go let the tea cool before assembling your boba you could either leave your tea on the counter and let it cool to room temperature or you could put it in the fridge to help it cool even faster avoid adding ice to it at this stage as that would dilute the tea and you ll already be adding ice to it later on 9 x research source not all boba tea is served with ice so if you want a cold drink but don t want to add ice put your tea in the fridge for a few hours add 1 2 cup 75 grams of boba to the bottom of a clean glass this amount can be adjusted based on how much tapioca you prefer in your tea feel free to add a little more or less as you desire use a spoon to transfer the boba so that you get a little bit of the simple syrup along with it 10 x research source depending on how sweet you like your tea you can always add more simple syrup too stir together the tea and milk in a separate glass you can use milk creamer sweetened condensed milk almond milk soy milk or any other kind of milk that you like like with the boba you can use as much or as little milk as you prefer 11 x research source you can always add more milk to your tea after it is all assembled if you want to if you want chilled boba but don t want to put ice in your drink shake the tea and milk in a cocktail mixer with a few ice cubes before straining the liquid over the tapioca pearls 12 x research source pour the liquid over the tapioca pearls and then add ice if you want sometimes if the tapioca pearls get too cold or come into direct contact with the ice before other liquid has been added they can start to harden adding the ice last should help keep the boba soft and chewy 13 x research source it s common to see boba tea served both with and without ice if you skip the ice just make sure to chill your tea in the fridge beforehand so it s as cool as possible enjoy your boba tea with a large straw once your tea is assembled you can add more milk or sweetener if you prefer some people even top their tea with fresh or frozen fruit to make it more like a dessert drink use a wide straw so you can suck up the tapioca pearls and enjoy them as you drink 14 x research source you can purchase wide straws online if you can t find them at your local grocery store some asian supermarkets may also carry

how to adapt to spicy food,spicy food is enjoyed the world over in some countries spicy foods are even fed to the very young to help acclimate their taste buds to the delicious heat eating spicy foods will open up a whole new world of culinary delights to those who dare to venture but for those who haven t eaten many spicy foods work is required to handle the hotter stuff follow a few simple guidelines to acclimate to the spicier food of the world,start small begin eating foods that are only slightly spicier than what you are currently accustomed for example add more black pepper to your meal than you normally would or garnish something with a few sprinklings of red pepper flakes 1 x research source there are hot varieties of candies and other small snacks that can help inject a regular helping of heat into your day check your local latin market for a good selection of spicy candies 2 x research source eat slowly devouring an entire plate of peppers at once will not do you any favors when trying to acclimate to spicier foods doing so will more likely turn you off of spicy food altogether instead add just a bit of spice to each meal over a long period of time savor the spice to get the full experience of the heat 3 x research source be patient don t get discouraged if your palate doesn t seem to be adjusting to the heat it can take anywhere from a few weeks to months to get accustomed to the new level of spice learn the types of heat available not all types of heat in food are the same the heat found in dishes with hot peppers are a much different experience than dishes that are heavy in garlic or wasabi education will help you branch out into hotter foods that are appropriate for your level of tolerance some foods such as garlic and radishes have a natural spiciness to them that don t stem from the heat causing agents of chili peppers these can be a great gateway into spicier foods without necessarily packing the physical sensations that dishes featuring hotter substances possess if you are just starting out you might start with these foods as they cannot physically damage your mouth with their oils 4 x research source when cooking with peppers look into each pepper s heat index rating referred to as the scoville scale measure which peppers you can handle as a baseline and move up from there go for broke 5 x research source gradually increase the amount of spice in your food as you adjust to the level of heat you can tolerate increase the heat level of your meals as you do so you will open up a wide range of food options you might never have considered trying you can achieve this in a variety of ways increase the quantity of the spicy food you are eating eating larger quantities of spicy food at a faster rate increases the reaction your body will produce to the heat add a hotter variety of the type of spice you enjoy many spicy foods come in a variety of heat levels including chili peppers onions and mustard add foods that provide a different kind of heat mustard horseradish and wasabi for example produce a shorter heat located in the nasal passages rather than the mouth 6 x research source cut back on the bread and milk rather than fight the heat allow it to work its course the goal is to build your tolerance study up on different cuisine many different types of cuisine throughout the world utilize a few staple spices in their dishes become familiar with the go to spices of each regional cuisine to prepare yourself for a particular level of heat indian cuisine for example often employs a few specific peppers in a spice mixture called a masala most common in these masalas is the green finger chile chefs will often adjust the spice mixture of the masala so ask ahead to gauge the spiciness featured in the masala ethiopian food often contains a spice mixture called berbere which features not only red chili peppers but ginger garlic and cloves this mix of heat can create a much different and hotter experience than a dish featuring only capsaicin based spices 7 x research source eat foods that help absorb heat during your quest to improve your tolerance keep a selection of foods nearby that absorb the oils that create the spicy sensation these side dishes can help lower the overall heat experienced with the food while still helping your taste buds acclimate starchy foods including bread crackers or potatoes are a few examples of foods that can absorb capsaicin the oil that causes the heat in spicy foods 8 x research source eat dishes that mix heat with other flavors a particularly hot spice or pepper can be diluted into a more tolerable state by mixing it into a dish with other strong flavors lime and cilantro for example both have cooling effects and can help counteract the spice medleys featuring a mix of vegetables or meat can also help dilute the spice 9 x research source sugar also helps dilute the heat associated with spicy foods a spicy dish with a little sweet on the side will help create a well rounded dish 10 x research source keep a glass of milk nearby milk is a classic reliever of heat thanks to a compound called casein that binds with capsaicin and washes it away if you are entering new territory in terms of heat or simply need occasional relief in between bites take a few sips of milk 11 x research source dairy such as yogurt or sour cream works similarly to milk when it comes to relieving heat and can make for a great side item in many spicy dishes,Food-and-Entertaining

fruits and lean protein and dairy and make healthy meals at home don t forget to make a plan and stick to it at the grocery store it can also help to make ingredients yourself such as yogurt and broths stocks,pick what s in season when fruits and vegetables are in season they tend to cost less often grocery stores will run sales on what s in season because they know customers expect certain fruits and veggies at certain times of the year as an added bonus when things are in season they taste better 1 x research source in fall look for produce like pumpkins winter squash cabbage and apples in the winter opt for winter squash cabbage and other root vegetables springtime is great for produce like beets leafy greens spring onions and asparagus summer is a good time for watermelon corn and berries just to name a few you ll likely notice the cheapest produce prices in summer also because produce is cheaper this time of year you can buy extra and freeze it or can it yourself check the prices on frozen and canned while you may prefer fresh fruits and vegetables you can often save money by opting for frozen or canned instead these options have the same health benefits though be sure to pick ones that don t have added sugar or salt 2 x research source check your proteins too frozen chicken may be cheaper than fresh and canned salmon and tuna is likely cheaper than fresh fish 3 x research source check out the weekly deals most grocery stores run weekly specials which you can learn about through their weekly ads when something is on sale that s the time to stock up on it most protein can be frozen and saved for later for instance so if your store is running a sale on boneless skinless chicken breasts buy some to use and save for later 4 x trustworthy source usda center for nutrition policy and promotion u s agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research go to source compare prices every time you probably already know to check for the lowest prices on the items you re buying however you may get stuck in a rut buying a certain brand and assuming it s the cheapest because it always has been however be vigilant as prices change all the time occasionally there is a sale on a certain package size or a discount on a run of product that changes what is the most affordable option 5 x trustworthy source usda center for nutrition policy and promotion u s agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research go to source look up and down as grocery stores tend to put the most expensive items at eye level keep an eye on store brands they tend to be cheaper buy in bulk while buying in bulk can come with a higher price upfront it ll be cheaper overall for instance buying a large can of quick oatmeal is much cheaper than buying a box of the instant packets add some fresh fruit to create your own flavors 6 x research source you can also buy some items in bulk bins at health food stores often these stores will have items like grains beans pastas nuts granolas flours and sugars you can get just what you need taking advantage of the cheaper prices without having to buy more than you need bulk items require timely use do not fall into the trap of buying an entire gallon of mayonnaise that you will never use up before it expires or that bargain box of cereal that no one in the family will eat use coupons take advantage of coupons when you come across them however only use them for the foods you would buy anyway if you re buying something you don t normally buy even if it is inexpensive you may be spending extra money for a product you do not want you can find coupons online as well as in the newspaper you can also use a variety of coupon apps to save money apply for snap

produce can make it cheaper as well be ready to use what you buy though as farm fresh produce doesn t tend to last as long as grocery market produce which is bred and treated to last longer however you ll make up for it in flavor some farmer s markets even accept snap choose cheaper ingredients not all healthy ingredients are expensive in fact many healthy ingredients are cheap take each category of food you need to buy and figure out options in each one for instance in whole grains you can try oatmeal brown rice bulgur popcorn and whole wheat bread and pasta for vegetables pick ones like cabbage leafy greens like mustard greens kale or even broccoli squash carrots and celery in fruit go for cheaper options such as oranges apples and bananas in the dairy section reach for milk and plain yogurt in large containers milk and yogurt can be flavored at home at minimal cost 9 x research source make your proteins last longer keep in mind that you probably need less protein than you think in your diet making your proteins last across several meals will help both your budget and your diet for instance if you make a chicken dish one night use the leftovers the next night to make a chicken soup the night after that use some of the chicken in tacos 10 x research source adult women under 30 only need 5 1 2 ounce equivalents each day while women over 30 only need 5 ounce equivalents adult men under 30 need 6 1 2 while if you re 30 to 50 you need 6 ounce equivalents and 5 1 2 if you re over 50 an ounce equivalent is one ounce 28 grams of meat 3 ounces of meat is about

to save money it will also keep the portion small opt for dishes with lean proteins paired with whole grains and lots of veggies choose veggies or fruit over fries onion rings or mashed potatoes ask for a take out box when you get your food split it in half before you start eating and put half in the box to take home splitting it up helps you control your portion and stretch your money grow what you can often having a small garden or even a few potted plants can be a cheap way to get in the veggies you need try growing a tomato plant for instance or even just a few herbs on your window sill 20 x research source create your own snacks you can buy pre made snacks at the store that are a bit healthier than your average chips such as veggie chips or fruit cups however they tend to be expensive so making your own at home is a more affordable alternative 21 x research source for example try making kale chips wash and dry kale thoroughly chop or tear the leaves into large pieces toss them in olive oil or spray them with cooking spray and then spread them out on a large baking sheet in a single layer sprinkle salt and pepper on top and any other seasoning you want bake them at 350 degrees fahrenheit 177 celsius until crispy about 15 minutes you can also make yourself individual cups of fruits and veggies for instance cut up oranges apples and grapefruit and toss them with a tiny bit of honey spoon them into small reusable containers so you can grab them any time you can do the same with veggies cut them into bite sized pieces and put them in reusable bags spoon out homemade hummus into individual containers to go with them boil up your own stocks and broths stocks and broths are a great way to start out soups but buying them in cans or cartons can get expensive plus they re often loaded with extra sodium making your own at home results in better quality and it s cheaper too 22 x research source you can even make a stock with your scraps save the bits of vegetables you have leftover such as onion skins the ends of carrots and the tops of celery when you eat a chicken save the bones and the bits of meat freeze them in a bag until you have enough when you do throw them in a pot and cover them with water boil them covered on low heat for six to eight hours or until you have a stock with a flavor you like strain it and your stock is ready once you have your stock you can portion it out in small containers and freeze it branch out into making other foods lots of foods besides snacks and broths can be made cheaper at home for instance if you eat yogurt often making your own yogurt might be a good option for bread consider investing in a bread making machine so you can make your own bread at the push of a button 23 x research

how to pair food and wine,the right wine can enhance a dish to perfection while there are no hard and fast rules on matching food and wine because it s ultimately a matter of personal taste there are basic guidelines on what wine connoisseurs and food lovers consider make good choices in this article you ll learn about how to make wine choices that will complement the flavors of a meal,start with an open mind whatever you read this article included is guidance not a rule if you prefer different combinations nothing is stopping you from enjoying this the principal purpose of guides on pairing food and wine is to enlighten your understanding on commonly agreed matches and the reasons behind these it s about taking some of the guesswork out of matching food and wine until you re comfortable enough to rely on your own experience ultimately you ll learn to tune into your own palate as the best guide to what wine works with what food a basic guideline is to match and complement the characteristics of food to the wine or contrast or counterbalance overpowering characteristics for example spicy foods with sweeter wine be aware that some wines can be spoiled by the introduction of certain food flavors just as they can be enhanced if you find that a wine you ve always loved suddenly tastes less desirable track down the food you paired it with and try drinking it without food before dismissing the wine outright know how to taste wine before embarking on the journey of pairing wine and food read how to taste wine to learn more understand what matters when assessing the affinity of a wine with a food it is important to seek a balance in the wine s components fruit acid alcohol sweetness and tannin and the food components ingredients manner of cooking and the resulting tastes it is about more than just the flavor also to be taken into account are the texture weight structure and bouquet of both wine and food for instance delicate food requires a delicate wine while richer and more robust food will match best with heavier fuller flavored wines the manner in which a food is cooked will impact the appropriateness of a wine the nature of a food changes according to whether it is roasted baked poached steamed marinated seasoned cooked in sauce or left in as near to its original state as possible this is why generalizations of suitability are too simplistic the flavor texture weight and composition of the food needs to be considered individually regardless of the principal component of a dish while similarities attract opposites can do so too what is most important is that the food and wine complement one another in such a way that your attention can be drawn from the wine to the food and back again without losing the essence of either keep the food flavors simple if the flavors of the food are too complex it will be hard to match it with any wine because the food becomes so dominant if you have a particularly complex or rich food dish it s recommended that you don t try matching your prized wines but rely on cheaper more readily available wines in case the match is unpleasant or even terrible know how to taste food and wine together to enable you to branch out beyond the generalities being aware of how to taste the food and wine together is vital it is suggested that you do the following 1 x research source lyndey milan and colin corney i balance matching food and wine what works and why i p 13 2005 isbn 0 7344 0824 2 take a mouthful of wine and roll it around your mouth swallow ask yourself what you taste and smell look for familiar fruit berry and wood flavors decide whether you find the wine light or heavy consider the sweetness or acidity of the wine take your summation of the wine and try to match it to similar characteristics in food find at least one aspect that corresponds with the food such as the sweetness the flavor the texture etc try the food eat a small piece chew and swallow it as with the wine consider how it tastes as well as the aftertaste if it s a pleasant experience you ve hit on a winner if not the pairing isn t made in heaven and it s time to try a different wine know your taste experience there four to five tastes saltiness bitterness acidity sweetness and the japanese umami these are the tastes that you ll be combining together in the same way an artist combines paint on the palette saltiness this taste is the easiest to recognize and it lingers saltiness brings out sweetness hides tannins and increases bitterness sweet dessert wines go well with salty foods or very fruity reds acidity highly acidic foods are not ideal with wine because they tend to cancel out the wine s flavor as such leave the vinegars vinaigrettes and dressings to a minimum when pairing food and wine acidity is a taste that lingers it can hide tannin and bitterness and make wine seem sweeter an acidic wine should be paired with a dish that is of lower acidity to prevent flattening the wine for example add a little sugar to take the edge off a vinaigrette bitterness bitter foods include radicchio olives rocket etc it s a taste that outlasts all other tastes bitterness is able to cover up acidity in a wine hides the tannins and brings out the sweetness young red wines work well with bitter greens wild herbs and olives sweetness another easy taste for many although the ability to taste sweetness declines with age sweetness doesn t last long as a taste it minimizes bitterness and acidity in a wine aim to partner sweet wine with food that isn t overly sweet to have both as sweet as the other will cancel out the wine if you have chocolate enjoy a liqueur tokay or a muscat rather than a sweet wine umami this is the taste that emanates from broth style or earthy food such as soups miso stock consommé roast meats mushrooms etc umami takes off the edge of tannins and brings out the sweetness making it a good choice for wines high in tannin start pairing wine and food it is possible to make generalities and you ll often find suggestions for pairing food and wine at the wine store however as already noted such generalities are very broad and don t necessarily account for the manner in which the food is cooked or what else is accompanying it such as spices or a cream based sauce as such while the following offers general guidance it is still important to rely on your own palate and to continue exploring the matching process lifelong see the following step after this section on developing nuanced approaches to these generalizations beef and lamb select red wine for beef and lamb dishes usually a full bodied red such as a shiraz or cabernet shiraz blend works well 2 x research source the sunday telegraph i domestic bliss i p 4 176 isbn 1 740640 37 3 suitable wines include barbera sangiovese cabernet sauvignon merlot syrah pinot noir and zinfandel however if it were asparagus alone as shown on the picture a grassy sauvignon blanc would had been a sensible choice chicken white wine is the usual pick for grilled or roast chicken try a chardonnay for chicken cooked in a rich sauce try a shiraz or a medium bodied cabernet sauvignon fish and seafood select a white wine for fish and seafood these wines would include chardonnay riesling pinot grigio sauvignon blanc and gewürztraminer grilled firm flesh fish matches well with chardonnay or an aged semillon while a hearty fish stew is excellent accompanied by pinot noir for flaky fish choose a dry riesling or a chardonnay spicy choose riesling and sweet gewürztraminer if your meal is spicy the sweetness of these wines can be drank quickly to offset the spiciness of the food avoid adding a chardonnay to spicy food as it will taste bitter 3 x research source lyndey milan and colin corney i balance matching food and wine what works and why i p 11 2005 isbn 0 7344 0824 2 game choose a spicy red like sangiovese or shiraz for game such as venison bison or kangaroo tomato acidic based meals serve barbera sangiovese or zinfandel with tomato based meals for example spaghetti and pizza duck quail try a pinot noir or a shiraz cheese full bodied wines go well with hard cheese such as a full bodied shiraz with cheddar cheese soft cheese partners well with dry riesling marsanne or viognier sweet wine is a good match for blue cheese dessert sweet wines are a good choice provided that the dessert is not as sweet as the wine deepen your pairing knowledge by discovering the nuances build on the basic understanding of what might match it s easy enough to say that chicken goes with white wine or beef goes with red wine but which wine exactly and is this choice clear cut the wine that goes with the food will depend heavily on the manner in which the food has been prepared for example it isn t as simple as saying that chicken goes with white wine if for example the chicken has been poached making it simple and delicate a simple wine such as a young semillon will be good when roasted the fat makes the chicken richer thus requiring a heavier textured wine such as an aged semillon if barbecued the chicken becomes smoky and goes well with a wine aged in wood such as a light chardonnay when chicken has been cooked in cream it becomes really rich a heavier chardonnay will pair well when it s made into a darker dish such as by adding soy sauce it can take a light red such as a pinot noir place chicken into a red wine marinade and it makes sense to pair it with red wine 4 x research source lyndey milan and colin corney i balance matching food and wine what works and why i p 11 2005 isbn 0 7344 0824 2 learn the different flavors within each wine style and seek to match these to the food ingredients for example fruity elements and wood overtones impact the wine flavor and are important considerations when partnering the wine with food if you can taste peaches coconut tropical flavors smokiness herbs etc then take those flavors and find their food equivalents weight of the wine has an impact on pairing with food wines are light medium or full bodied referring to the depth of flavor on the mid palate when trying to discern the weight of the wine either ask the retailer or check the depth of color apart from pinot noir the darker the color the heavier the weight use your sense of smell to help you pair food and wine the two senses are one and you can trust your nose unless it s blocked wine smells can be floral perfumed mineral fruity common fruit smells are peach melon and fig butter nuts earthy truffle or mushroom meaty or even like the barnyard if the smell is unpleasant avoid it an aging wine can have overtones of toast or engine fuel consider pairing wine with the regional or origin of the cuisine for example provençal grilled lamb with garlic and rosemary with red bandol or châteauneuf du pape be aware also that the same type of wine can have a very different taste when it is sourced from a different region or country for example an american made sauvignon blanc tends to have a grassier flavor than a sauvignon blanc produced in new zealand the only way you ll know this is by tasting and contrasting the wine paying attention all the time to pairing it with the right food plan the meal and wine when planning dinner many people opt for planning the food first and adding in the wine according to the food however you might like to work from the other way and plan the meal according to the wine either way is appropriate but will impact how you explore the flavors and the perspective gained by looking at the wine first then the food can be quite a refreshing one,Food-and-Entertaining

how to enjoy spicy foods,if you didn t grow up eating spicy foods regularly you might be really sensitive to foods containing hot chillies and other spices that s because over time you can build up a tolerance to spice which is why some people can eat really hot foods while others are reluctant to even add cracked pepper to a dish if you want to train yourself to enjoy hot foods start with mild spices then gradually increase the heat level and don t worry if it gets a little too hot there are plenty of ways to cool off your mouth as you adjust,start by adding mild spices to your food if you re not used to eating a lot of spice it s best to start off by introducing just a little heat at a time to the dishes you re eating sprinkle a little cracked black pepper over the top of a baked potato for instance or add a few drops of hot sauce to the ketchup you re using for your fries if you do this regularly your palate will get used to a little heat which may make it easier for you to tackle really spicy foods later on 1 x research source mild chillies like poblano or banana peppers are another great way to experiment with heat try adding them to soups stews tacos casseroles and other dishes you can also add a spicy sauce alongside a mild dish that way you can control the heat as you re eating add one spice at a time to your food if you start mixing spices together you might not be able to pick out which flavors you like the best instead try just adding one heat source at a time to your food once you familiarize yourself with the subtle smoky earthy nutty or even sweet flavors contained in different spices you can start experimenting with combining them in your dishes 4 x research source using mild heat is a great way to start learning the flavors of different peppers since your tastebuds won t be overwhelmed by a burning sensation if you re really committed to embracing spicy flavors you might even want to write down your experiences in a notebook or a

while it might seem like it will be easier if you eat the whole thing as fast as possible this will cause your body to have a stronger reaction to the spice by eating slowly you can keep the heat at a more tolerable level 5 x research source eating slowly will also give you time to sip something cold or nibble on something else between bites of the hotter dish gradually increase the spice level as you get more comfortable once you find that you can tolerate mild spices start pushing yourself to try hotter foods add in seeded chopped chillies to your dishes such as jalapenos and serrano peppers the more often you eat them the more comfortable you ll become over time you might even find that you miss the heat when you eat a non spicy dish 6 x research source spicy chips and other snacks can be a good way to push yourself to try hotter foods they may burn your mouth but the addictive crunch will often have you coming back for more don t force yourself to eat foods that are uncomfortably spicy if you don t want to however if you really want to push your tolerance don t be afraid to take on something a little too hot once in a while keep in mind that the heat will fade and just have fun with the challenge focus on the other flavors of the food even if your mouth is burning try to turn your attention to a different flavor in the dish that you re eating for instance if you re eating a cheeseburger with jalapenos on top try to focus on the flavor of the beef or the cheese instead that can help distract you as you adjust to the heat level 7 x research source if you re dining out and you order a spicy dish try to identify as many different flavors and ingredients while you re eating as you can for instance if you re eating a spicy thai soup you might try to detect ginger lemongrass thai basil mint or other ingredients that are common in that cuisine 8 x research source enjoy an ice cold drink while you re eating hot foods if you know you ll be eating something that

capsaicin better than just water will if you re old enough to drink the alcohol in beer can also help ease the burn add dairy to the meal to cool it off just like milk can cool off your mouth dairy is an effective way to cool off a dish that s a little too spicy try adding a dollop of sour cream or yogurt to your plate to help balance the spice and make the dish more enjoyable 10 x research source if you don t eat dairy you can use coconut milk in your dish instead citrus flavors and cooling herbs like mint and cilantro may also help ease the heat of a spicy food pair your dish with food that s high in carbs crackers bread and rice are all great ways to help spread out concentrated spices this can make the dish more manageable for you allowing you to enjoy the subtle flavors of the food rather than just being overwhelmed by spice 11 x research source the starch may help absorb some of the spicy components in the food while the rough texture can help distract your tastebuds from the heat wait about 15 minutes for the heat to fade if you eat something that s just way too hot and it leaves your mouth burning try not to panic the effects of spicy food typically only last for about 15 minutes so if you re patient it will fade 12 x research source while the heat is fading keep reminding yourself that this experience will help you be more able to tolerate spicy foods in the

how to use healthy cooking methods,eating healthier meals is a big part of taking good care of yourself and your family but eating healthier doesn t mean you have to sacrifice flavor or eliminate your favorite foods learn how to cook your foods in a healthier way like by steaming your vegetables or broiling your meats similarly you can substitute some less nutritious ingredients for healthier alternatives like swapping out mayonnaise and using smashed avocado instead,boil your veggies and meats to cook them without using any oils or fats all you need to boil food is a large pot water and a little bit of salt carrots broccoli cauliflower potatoes chicken and beef are just a few options for ingredients you can boil check online for specific boiling times 1 x research source vegetables like carrots and broccoli generally take about 8 10 minutes to boil whereas potatoes will take a little bit longer about 15 minutes use a meat thermometer to check the interior temperature of meats to make sure they re cooked all the way through once you think the meat should be done remove it from the hot water with tongs and place it on a cutting board insert the meat thermometer and check the temperature chicken should be cooked to 165 f 74 c and beef should be cooked to 160 f 71 c if it isn t cooked yet add it back to the hot water for another couple of minutes boiling is a simpler way to cook and it s healthier than using lots of fats but it does also compromise the nutrients of the foods some veggies like brussels sprouts broccoli and sweet potatoes are water soluble which means they lose some nutrients when cooked in water steam your veggies and fish to keep all their nutrients intact you can place a steaming basket over a pot of boiling water or you could also wrap your ingredients in foil and place them in the steamer basket to contain all the juices simply bring a pot of water to a boil place your steam basket on top and add your ingredients to the basket 2 x research source the best ingredients to steam are veggies like green beans zucchini and asparagus fish fillets and shellfish also steam well in general the veggies and meats that take the least amount of time to cook are the best ones to steam veggies generally take about 15 20 minutes to steam whereas fish will take only about 6 15 minutes depending on how thick the fillet is check online for specific steaming times add a pinch of salt or some lemon juice to your steamed veggies or fish for some extra flavor grill your meats and veggies for a nice smoky flavor and less fat grilling is great because it makes your meat tender while also letting the fat drip away from it which is healthier for you it also imparts a nice flavor to meats and veggies you can grill steak and chicken as well as vegetables like asparagus peppers onions zucchini and even lettuce 3 x research source there are some studies that suggest the char from grilled foods is carcinogenic and shouldn t be eaten regularly to combat this try to grill leaner cuts of meat that have shorter cooking times or use a gas or electric grill if you can you can even grill fruits like peaches for a tasty addition to main meals and desserts stir fry your food for a quick flavorful option use a few teaspoons of a healthy cooking oil like extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil and add in your chopped veggies and protein for a 10 minute meal because the cooking time is so short there is less time for your ingredients to lose their healthy nutrients 4 x research source try stir frying mushrooms zucchini peppers onions and chicken for a tasty dinner option add a little bit of low sodium soy sauce and some garlic to the dish for some extra flavor your body does need some fats in order to function at its best so its okay to use heart healthy oils avoid using butter lard and sauces that are high in calories fat and sugar broil your meals in the oven for a fast way to cook broiling is a high heat option that doesn t require you to add any additional oils or fats to your dish use lean cuts of meat like chicken and fish and heartier vegetables like squash and onion make sure you preheat the broiler before putting your dish in the oven or broiler drawer 5 x research source meals take about 12 15 minutes to broil always check your meat with a meat thermometer before serving it the risk with broiling foods is that because of the high heat level the food can dry out quickly that s why it s a good idea to use thinner leaner cuts of meat so that they won t take as long to cook microwave your food so it retains its nutrients while cooking quickly a microwave with a carousel that rotates the food is the best kind to use make sure you put your food into microwave safe dishes use a flat plate to cover the dishes when you microwave them to keep the food moist check online for cooking times for different ingredients 6 x research source there are some myths out there about microwaving but you don t need to worry about losing nutrients through microwaving veggies or about unhealthy radiation microwaves use electromagnetic radiation which is different from that kind of radiation that causes cancer potatoes take about 15 minutes to cook in the microwave whereas broccoli takes about 6 minutes if you cook meat in the microwave make sure to check the internal temperature before you eat it microwaving is a fast healthy option it essentially steams the food so keep in mind that you won t get any of the flavor that you might from grilling or stir frying try adding some seasonings to your food like salt pepper or lemon juice try eating raw foods to avoid losing any nutrients through cooking focus on eating uncooked and unprocessed foods like fruits vegetables nuts seeds and pasteurized dairy products 7 x research source eating only raw foods isn t recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or who plan on becoming pregnant check with your doctor if you have concerns about your daily food intake choose whole wheat flour or grains when you cook breads pastas and rices all have whole wheat options available and they can usually be found at your local grocery store these options contain more fiber and they take longer to digest so they keep you full for longer 8 x research source check out other healthy grain substitutes like quinoa couscous and barley these options generally have more fiber fewer calories and are denser grains which means you ll be fuller for longer if you are gluten free try cauliflower rice or making pasta out of spiralized veggies use greek yogurt instead of sour cream for a heart healthy substitute purchase plain greek yogurt and use it in place of sour cream whether you are using it as a component of an actual recipe or just as a topping to a dish like baked potatoes or tacos 9 x research source greek yogurt has fewer calories and grams of fat than sour cream and the texture and taste are very similar smash up an avocado to use in place of mayonnaise or cheese if you re looking for a creamy alternative when making sandwiches wraps or tuna salad try cutting open an avocado and mashing the fruit to use lieu of mayo or cheese 10 x research source avocado has a similar texture to mayonnaise and while avocado is still high in fat it has tons of other vitamins minerals and fiber choose evoo over butter and explore other oil alternatives avoid canola oil and oils that say partially hydrogenated which can contain a lot of trans fats extra virgin oil avocado grapeseed coconut walnut and sesame oils all have different flavors and benefits visit your local health food store and explore the oil section to choose a heart healthy cooking oil 11 x research source evoo has antioxidants that regular olive oil doesn t and the higher quality of the oil means that it s going to taste better too don t be afraid to splurge a little on a bottle of good evoo nix the egg yolk and use only egg whites to cut down on cholesterol whether you re making omelets or a frittata try using egg whites rather than whole eggs for a dish that has a lot fewer calories and less cholesterol 12 x research source in general you substitute 2 egg whites for 1 whole egg you can buy a container of egg whites at the store to simplify your cooking process trade your bacon and red meats for turkey for a low fat substitute turkey bacon and ground turkey are great low fat substitutes to use in place of other meats look for ground turkey that has a 90 10 ratio and use it to make burgers meatballs chilis and other dishes that usually call for ground beef 13 x trustworthy source national heart lung and blood institute research and education center within the national institutes of health go to source while turkey and ground

how to become a taste tester,the term taste tester can be applied to a variety of different jobs there are consumer taste testers who help food manufacturers decide when a product is ready for the market and there are what we ll refer to as professional taste testers which include food scientists and sensory analysts professional taste testers usually work directly for a food manufacturer or other related companies they are part of a team that create new food products and improve existing products only professional taste testers require a formal education usually one of the physical sciences,research consumer taste testing opportunities a variety of organizations food manufacturers restaurants consulting companies governments and universities hire consumers to test food products being a consumer taste tester is not a full time job so you ll want to look for an opportunity close to where you already live the best place to start is with a google search for taste testers in your area consumer taste testers get paid approximately 15 hour or up but sometimes are paid per test instead of per hour if you know of a specific organization in your area start your search on their website some examples of where to look include the following mccormick company is located in hunt valley maryland 1 x research source the consumer product testing centre via the government of alberta is located in edmonton alberta 2 x research source the national food lab is located in livermore california the north carolina state university sensory service centre is located in raleigh north carolina 3 x research source check eligibility requirements organizations require that as a taste tester you be at least 18 years old to participate in their programs and you cannot have any existing food allergies you will also be required to complete taste tests during weekdays and during work hours 4 x research source each organization may have their own specific requirements as well you can confirm these requirements on their website when you complete an application also be aware that some organizations may have a limit on the number of times you can participate in a consumer taste test in a given year 5 x research source submit an application complete the required application or registration form from the organization s website most applications can be completed and submitted online but a few are still require a paper application to be submitted via mail applications will require basic items like your name address phone number email address gender and birthdate you may also be asked about your food preferences including whether you are a vegetarian or vegan answer more detailed screening questions all the information you provide to a taste test organization is stored in a database the organization then uses the database to find the right people to participate in each taste test based on the information you ve provided to them in order to ensure they can find the right testers for each opportunity the organization may send you questionnaires asking very specific questions about food be sure to answer any questions that are asked honestly as your answers will impact what tests you ll be asked to participate in for example some tests may require males who are 20 to 35 years old the organization will query the database to find all testers who are male and who are between the ages of 20 and 35 they will then reach out to some of those testers to see who may be interested in participating sign up for taste test opportunities in addition to reaching out to you on a proactive basis some organizations have an online portal for testers only you ll be able to sign into this section of the website to view potential testing opportunities keeping track of potential opportunities on your own will help ensure you re able to participate in more tests organizations like fpi testers also post available tests on their facebook and twitter accounts in order to make sure you don t miss any great opportunities follow the accounts for the organization for which you re a member and keep track of what they post on social media prepare yourself for tasting once you re all setup with an organization it s time to prepare for an actual taste test information about what to expect at a taste test can be found on the organization s website and if anything specific is required they ll send that information to you directly 6 x research source before a taste test the organization will send you information about the ingredients in the items you ll be testing review this information to ensure you won t have an issue with any of them some additional ways to prepare are included below be on time or a little early do not eat or smoke within the 30 minutes before your test do not wear fragrant items like perfume or cologne do not bring children with you you will also be required to turn your cell phone off when in the test depending on the type of test you may also be required not to speak to anyone else while at the test determine if a food science or sensory analysis career is right for you among other things one thing many food scientists or sensory analysts do is help develop new food products or make existing food products better in order to make sure the food meets consumer expectations they spend time organizing taste tests with consumers and analyzing the results of those tests food scientists also get to taste test their own food before it is tested by consumers 7 x trustworthy source us bureau of labor statistics u s government agency

how to pair food and wine,the right wine can enhance a dish to perfection while there are no hard and fast rules on matching food and wine because it s ultimately a matter of personal taste there are basic guidelines on what wine connoisseurs and food lovers consider make good choices in this article you ll learn about how to make wine choices that will complement the flavors of a meal,start with an open mind whatever you read this article included is guidance not a rule if you prefer different combinations nothing is stopping you from enjoying this the principal purpose of guides on pairing food and wine is to enlighten your understanding on commonly agreed matches and the reasons behind these it s about taking some of the guesswork out of matching food and wine until you re comfortable enough to rely on your own experience ultimately you ll learn to tune into your own palate as the best guide to what wine works with what food a basic guideline is to match and complement the characteristics of food to the wine or contrast or counterbalance overpowering characteristics for example spicy foods with sweeter wine be aware that some wines can be spoiled by the introduction of certain food flavors just as they can be enhanced if you find that a wine you ve always loved suddenly tastes less desirable track down the food you paired it with and try drinking it without food before dismissing the wine outright know how to taste wine before embarking on the journey of pairing wine and food read how to taste wine to learn more understand what matters when assessing the affinity of a wine with a food it is important to seek a balance in the wine s components fruit acid alcohol sweetness and tannin and the food components ingredients manner of cooking and the resulting tastes it is about more than just the flavor also to be taken into account are the texture weight structure and bouquet of both wine and food for instance delicate food requires a delicate wine while richer and more robust food will match best with heavier fuller flavored wines the manner in which a food is cooked will impact the appropriateness of a wine the nature of a food changes according to whether it is roasted baked poached steamed marinated seasoned cooked in sauce or left in as near to its original state as possible this is why generalizations of suitability are too simplistic the flavor texture weight and composition of the food needs to be considered individually regardless of the principal component of a dish while similarities attract opposites can do so too what is most important is that the food and wine complement one another in such a way that your attention can be drawn from the wine to the food and back again without losing the essence of either keep the food flavors simple if the flavors of the food are too complex it will be hard to match it with any wine because the food becomes so dominant if you have a particularly complex or rich food dish it s recommended that you don t try matching your prized wines but rely on cheaper more readily available wines in case the match is unpleasant or even terrible know how to taste food and wine together to enable you to branch out beyond the generalities being aware of how to taste the food and wine together is vital it is suggested that you do the following 1 x research source lyndey milan and colin corney i balance matching food and wine what works and why i p 13 2005 isbn 0 7344 0824 2 take a mouthful of wine and roll it around your mouth swallow ask yourself what you taste and smell look for familiar fruit berry and wood flavors decide whether you find the wine light or heavy consider the sweetness or acidity of the wine take your summation of the wine and try to match it to similar characteristics in food find at least one aspect that corresponds with the food such as the sweetness the flavor the texture etc try the food eat a small piece chew and swallow it as with the wine consider how it tastes as well as the aftertaste if it s a pleasant experience you ve hit on a winner if not the pairing isn t made in heaven and it s time to try a different wine know your taste experience there four to five tastes saltiness bitterness acidity sweetness and the japanese umami these are the tastes that you ll be combining together in the same way an artist combines paint on the palette saltiness this taste is the easiest to recognize and it lingers saltiness brings out sweetness hides tannins and increases bitterness sweet dessert wines go well with salty foods or very fruity reds acidity highly acidic foods are not ideal with wine because they tend to cancel out the wine s flavor as such leave the vinegars vinaigrettes and dressings to a minimum when pairing food and wine acidity is a taste that lingers it can hide tannin and bitterness and make wine seem sweeter an acidic wine should be paired with a dish that is of lower acidity to prevent flattening the wine for example add a little sugar to take the edge off a vinaigrette bitterness bitter foods include radicchio olives rocket etc it s a taste that outlasts all other tastes bitterness is able to cover up acidity in a wine hides the tannins and brings out the sweetness young red wines work well with bitter greens wild herbs and olives sweetness another easy taste for many although the ability to taste sweetness declines with age sweetness doesn t last long as a taste it minimizes bitterness and acidity in a wine aim to partner sweet wine with food that isn t overly sweet to have both as sweet as the other will cancel out the wine if you have chocolate enjoy a liqueur tokay or a muscat rather than a sweet wine umami this is the taste that emanates from broth style or earthy food such as soups miso stock consommé roast meats mushrooms etc umami takes off the edge of tannins and brings out the sweetness making it a good choice for wines high in tannin start pairing wine and food it is possible to make generalities and you ll often find suggestions for pairing food and wine at the wine store however as already noted such generalities are very broad and don t necessarily account for the manner in which the food is cooked or what else is accompanying it such as spices or a cream based sauce as such while the following offers general guidance it is still important to rely on your own palate and to continue exploring the matching process lifelong see the following step after this section on developing nuanced approaches to these generalizations beef and lamb select red wine for beef and lamb dishes usually a full bodied red such as a shiraz or cabernet shiraz blend works well 2 x research source the sunday telegraph i domestic bliss i p 4 176 isbn 1 740640 37 3 suitable wines include barbera sangiovese cabernet sauvignon merlot syrah pinot noir and zinfandel however if it were asparagus alone as shown on the picture a grassy sauvignon blanc would had been a sensible choice chicken white wine is the usual pick for grilled or roast chicken try a chardonnay for chicken cooked in a rich sauce try a shiraz or a medium bodied cabernet sauvignon fish and seafood select a white wine for fish and seafood these wines would include chardonnay riesling pinot grigio sauvignon blanc and gewürztraminer grilled firm flesh fish matches well with chardonnay or an aged semillon while a hearty fish stew is excellent accompanied by pinot noir for flaky fish choose a dry riesling or a chardonnay spicy choose riesling and sweet gewürztraminer if your meal is spicy the sweetness of these wines can be drank quickly to offset the spiciness of the food avoid adding a chardonnay to spicy food as it will taste bitter 3 x research source lyndey milan and colin corney i balance matching food and wine what works and why i p 11 2005 isbn 0 7344 0824 2 game choose a spicy red like sangiovese or shiraz for game such as venison bison or kangaroo tomato acidic based meals serve barbera sangiovese or zinfandel with tomato based meals for example spaghetti and pizza duck quail try a pinot noir or a shiraz cheese full bodied wines go well with hard cheese such as a full bodied shiraz with cheddar cheese soft cheese partners well with dry riesling marsanne or viognier sweet wine is a good match for blue cheese dessert sweet wines are a good choice provided that the dessert is not as sweet as the wine deepen your pairing knowledge by discovering the nuances build on the basic understanding of what might match it s easy enough to say that chicken goes with white wine or beef goes with red wine but which wine exactly and is this choice clear cut the wine that goes with the food will depend heavily on the manner in which the food has been prepared for example it isn t as simple as saying that chicken goes with white wine if for example the chicken has been poached making it simple and delicate a simple wine such as a young semillon will be good when roasted the fat makes the chicken richer thus requiring a heavier textured wine such as an aged semillon if barbecued the chicken becomes smoky and goes well with a wine aged in wood such as a light chardonnay when chicken has been cooked in cream it becomes really rich a heavier chardonnay will pair well when it s made into a darker dish such as by adding soy sauce it can take a light red such as a pinot noir place chicken into a red wine marinade and it makes sense to pair it with red wine 4 x research source lyndey milan and colin corney i balance matching food and wine what works and why i p 11 2005 isbn 0 7344 0824 2 learn the different flavors within each wine style and seek to match these to the food ingredients for example fruity elements and wood overtones impact the wine flavor and are important considerations when partnering the wine with food if you can taste peaches coconut tropical flavors smokiness herbs etc then take those flavors and find their food equivalents weight of the wine has an impact on pairing with food wines are light medium or full bodied referring to the depth of flavor on the mid palate when trying to discern the weight of the wine either ask the retailer or check the depth of color apart from pinot noir the darker the color the heavier the weight use your sense of smell to help you pair food and wine the two senses are one and you can trust your nose unless it s blocked wine smells can be floral perfumed mineral fruity common fruit smells are peach melon and fig butter nuts earthy truffle or mushroom meaty or even like the barnyard if the smell is unpleasant avoid it an aging wine can have overtones of toast or engine fuel consider pairing wine with the regional or origin of the cuisine for example provençal grilled lamb with garlic and rosemary with red bandol or châteauneuf du pape be aware also that the same type of wine can have a very different taste when it is sourced from a different region or country for example an american made sauvignon blanc tends to have a grassier flavor than a sauvignon blanc produced in new zealand the only way you ll know this is by tasting and contrasting the wine paying attention all the time to pairing it with the right food plan the meal and wine when planning dinner many people opt for planning the food first and adding in the wine according to the food however you might like to work from the other way and plan the meal according to the wine either way is appropriate but will impact how you explore the flavors and the perspective gained by looking at the wine first then the food can be quite a refreshing one,Food-and-Entertaining

can either ask your guests to make a variety of dishes or you can hold a cook off that features only one kind of dish there are upsides and downsides to both 2 x research source if you are holding a cook off with only one kind of dish it makes it easier to judge the dishes against each other but there won t be as much variety for your guests if you host a cook off with different dishes it makes it harder to judge but your guests will leave feeling that they have had a full satisfying meal common cook off foods are chili and barbecue try to pick food that is tasty but that isn t that difficult to make you can make categories like sides entrees and deserts to judge by if you don t want everyone to cook the same food use word of mouth to tell friends about the cookout tell any friends or family that you see at work school or social events say that you are interested in organizing a cookout give them the date for the cookout and ask if they can make it say something like i m thinking of hosting a cookout on saturday the 14th it would be great if you could be there either as a cook or a guest do you think you ll be able to come email and call friends you don t see regularly you might not be able to see all your potential cookout guests in person if there are people that you want to invite but don t see on a daily basis email or call them tell them about the cookout as well as the date and time you have in mind and see if they want to come 3 x research source get friends of friends on board it could be that your friends know people who are fabulous cooks when you are contacting friends and family tell them to feel free to invite anyone they think would be interested 4 x research source use social message to get out your message make a post on facebook or another social media site to spread the word about your cook off even if you have contacted all of your closest friends there probably are other people that you can reach through social media who would be interested 5 x research source post something like i m holding a cook off scheduled for saturday the 14th let me know if you d like to participate or come as a guest to sample some delicious food if you want to keep the cook off small and you think you already have enough people coming you can hold off on posting on social media find a couple of people to judge since the cook off is a competition you will need to have someone to judge find someone or a couple of people who are chefs restaurant owners or have some kind of job or experience in the food industry you can offer them an incentive like a gift card or small amount of money to judge the cook off 6 x research source if you cannot find anyone instead plan to have all your guests act as judges by casting their votes for their favorite dish pick a location another important decision to make is where the cook off will take place if you feel comfortable hosting the cook off it may be the most convenient location since you will be able to prepare and set up in advance you also can see if there is anyone else attending who would be willing to host 7 x research source you may want to hold the cook off somewhere outdoors cook offs can be messy so consider doing it outdoors if the weather permits some foods like barbecue can only be prepared outdoors on a grill you can also rent a space at a local venue to hold the cook off but it will be quite expensive come up with an entry fee most cookouts have an entry fee which can help you cover costs this fee makes sense since you are providing your guests with a hot meal make sure that the fee is appropriate for the type of cook off you are planning for instance if it is a small casual cook off consider a fee of around 15 if it is a fundraiser or larger event consider charging more calculate the cost of the event a cook off can be pricey calculate about how much it will be to hold the cook off this includes equipment as well as cooking supplies if you find that your estimate is higher than what you can afford there are several ways you can cut the cost you can go to stores like costco that sell ingredients and supplies in bulk which can save you money think about upping your entry fee if you are worried about expenses make sure you will have the proper cooking equipment for the cook off outdoor grills crock pots and portable heat sources to cook on are among the most common equipment needed for cook offs you can ask your guests to bring the equipment that they will need such as a portable grill or a crockpot so you don t have to provide them all yourself make sure you have the rest of the supplies you need either buy or ask your guests to bring any other things you may need for the cookout depending on your budget these could include plenty of tables and chairs paper plates cups utensils and napkins these details can sometimes slip through the cracks but they are essential to the cook off s success 8 x research source don t forget to buy condiments like sour cream ketchup mustard or mayonnaise if needed you also may want to provide drinks like soda or alcoholic beverages you may want to consider buying a cooler and ice if you are providing cold drinks make sure you have access to outlets you will need to use outlets to plug in equipment like crockpots if you are far away from a power source either buy extension cords or ask your guests to bring them send out invitations now that you have all the details finalized send out invitations either by email or mail with the exact time date location and food that will be served include any information about what equipment your guests should bring also ask guests who aren t cooking to bring snacks like chips cheese and crackers and drinks 9 x research source there are online sites that you can use to send invitations and keep track of rsvp s start at least two hours early begin setting up the event two hours before it starts this way you won t be waiting until the last minute and if you realize you are missing something you can find a solution before the cook off starts meet with the cooks and run over the plan once people start arriving at the cook out you will want to talk with the chefs round up everyone who will be cooking and tell them everything they need to know this could include things like where they should be stationed as well as the start and finish times of the cooking divide the chefs and the rest of the guests you don t want the guests or the judges to see which chef is making which dish have your guests step away from the cooking by having the drinks and snacks in a separate area where guests can mingle and talk as the chefs are cooking this way the entries will be anonymous signal the beginning and the end of the cooking signal the start of the cooking by making an announcement or blowing a whistle make sure that the chefs have an appropriate amount of time to either cook or warm up their dish blow a whistle when the cooking period is over walk around during the cooking and check in with chefs to see if they have any questions or if they need more supplies give additional time for cooking on site if your chefs are all cooking their dishes entirely on site make sure to give them enough time how much time it takes may vary depending on the dish they are cooking having access to a kitchen is often a good idea if the cooking is happening on site label each crock pot or serving container give each chef a number after the cooking is over have each chef make a sign to put in front of his or her serving container with the number of their dish and a brief description for instance a possible sign could read 3 spicy red bean chili make sure this sign does not have their name label plates once the chefs have their number have the chefs divvy up small portions of their food into small serving containers so everyone can enjoy make sure that these containers are labelled with the chef s assigned number this will make it easy for judges and guests to pick a favorite dish still without knowing which chef cooked what 10 x research source let everyone eat have the chefs step away from their station so that no one can tell who cooked what make sure judges get the food immediately after it s cooked so it s still hot also distribute food out to the rest of your guests supervise the judges let the judges know what rating system you want them to use many times a scaled numbering system from one to ten works best have the judge write down their scores and any comments they have on the food then gather these up and see what chef received the highest score if your guests are acting as the judges give them all a ballot where they can write down their favorite dish or dishes announce the winner of the cook off after everyone has had a chance to eat announce which chef cooked which dish then reveal the winner of the cook off as well as second and third place announce the scores of the top three chefs and read any comments that the judges or guests have left for them this is best left for the end of the event 11 x research source give out prizes and thank everyone for coming give out prizes to the top two or top three winners make sure that the prizes you are giving out could be appreciated by anyone and are not gender specific gift cards are a good thing to give if you cannot think of anything that all your contestants would appreciate 12 x research source you could also give away food items like artisan olive oil or good wine after the winner is announced and the cook off is winding down thank your guests for coming let your chefs know that you appreciated all their hard work and thank your judges for their time also remind everyone to take all their equipment and supplies home so you won t have to return them later 13 x research source clean up you likely will have a lot of clean up to do after the cook off if you feel comfortable ask a couple of friends if they can stick around and help you you probably will have a couple people who will volunteer to help it may be the least fun part of the cook off but you can feel good that you hosted such a successful and enjoyable event 14 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

how to pair wine and chocolate,people often think of wine and chocolate as going together they are both decadent luxurious and packed with complex flavors both are also associated with romantic or indulgent moments but the intense flavors of both wine and chocolate can clash on your palate if you don t match your selections carefully after you ve selected your chocolate pick the right kind of wine to go with it then take time to appreciate your delicious pairing,choose dark chocolate for a more intense flavor dark chocolate is composed of 35 70 chocolate liquor and cocoa butter the higher

bitter if you re interested in getting the maximum health benefits out of your chocolate dark chocolate is the way to go it contains the highest concentrations of anti oxidant flavanols the percentage of cocoa in the chocolate is usually listed on the label pick milk chocolate for a sweeter flavor and creamy texture milk chocolate usually contains a lower percentage of liquor than dark chocolate

along with a lighter color 2 x research source if you crave the more bitter taste of dark chocolate along with the creamy goodness of milk chocolate consider a dark milk chocolate which can contain up to 42 chocolate liquor select white chocolate for the sweetest flavor white chocolate contains no chocolate liquor at all which means that it is technically not a true chocolate it is composed of cocoa butter milk and sweeteners it is the sweetest and mildest of all the varieties of chocolate 3 x research source try chocolate with fruit nuts or other additives for a more complex flavor and

wine 4 x research source give inexpensive chocolate treats a chance you don t have to limit yourself to fancy high end chocolates to achieve a delicious and fun pairing consider pairing wine with a classic candy bar chocolate kisses or peanut butter cups 5 x research source go for a sweet wine if the chocolate is sweeter than the wine you select the wine will taste acrid or bitter in contrast

intensity of the dessert 7 x research source for example a simple bittersweet chocolate bar might go well with a light sparkling fruity wine like a brachetto d acqui a rich and creamy piece of fudge or chocolate cake will pair well with a heavier more syrupy fortified wine like banyuls or maury try a fruity red wine with dark chocolate if you re eating bitter dark chocolate you can get away with a less sweet wine the wine you select should be fruity low in tannins and not super dry or acidic 8 x research source some good options include warm climate cabernet sauvignon merlot or petit syrah for a sweeter heavier companion to your dark chocolate try port drink a sweet or dessert wine with milk chocolate milk chocolate is sweeter than dark chocolate so it will go best with a sweeter wine try a sweet or semi sweet wine like moscatel px sherry port zinfandel or vino santo 9 x research source pair white chocolate with a dessert wine since white chocolate is extremely sweet it will taste best when paired with a very sweet wine ice wine which is made by allowing the grapes to freeze on the vine before fermenting is an especially popular pairing with white chocolate 10 x research source

banyuls also goes well with desserts that include berries 12 x research source chocolate with caramel and sea salt pairs well with red wines that have berry chocolate or spicy notes try combining dark chocolate with caramel and salt with a cabernet sauvignon and malbec blend 13 x research source keep an open mind remember that wine pairing guidelines are just that guidelines although most wine connoisseurs wouldn t recommend it you might love the contrast of a super sweet white chocolate with an ultra dry red wine the only way to know what you like is to try different things 14 x research source cleanse your palate to really appreciate the tastes of wine and chocolate together use a simple palate cleanser to get any lingering flavors from dinner out of your mouth eat something with a neutral flavor like a few bites of white bread and drink a little water 15 x research source smell before you taste your sense of smell contributes a lot to what you taste inhaling the aroma of your food and drink first can help you appreciate the various flavors more fully it can also build your anticipation by giving you a preview of what your taste buds are about to experience 16 x research source hold each piece of chocolate to your nose and take a moment to inhale deeply before you bite before taking a sip of wine swirl the glass gently then take a series of quick short sniffs from just above the top of the glass 17 x research source taste the chocolate before sipping the wine take a small bite of chocolate and allow it to melt enough to coat the inside of your mouth close your eyes and concentrate on what you feel and taste make note of 18 x research source the texture is it smooth and creamy does it have a crumbly or fudgy texture if your chocolate contains nuts sea salt or bits of nougat what do they contribute to the texture the flavor is it bitter sweet or both are there fruity or salty notes do you detect hints of almond or hazelnut sip the wine immediately after swallowing the chocolate take a quick sniff of the wine then take a sip while the taste of the chocolate is still lingering in your mouth pay attention to the feel and taste of the wine and think about how it mingles with the flavors of the chocolate for example does the wine feel smooth or crisp does the texture work well with the texture of the chocolate do you notice any notes in the wine that complement the chocolate particularly well for example hints of berry can go particularly well with dark or milk chocolate take your time allow yourself to be in the moment and savor the mingling of the flavors close your eyes and take a few moments to concentrate entirely on the taste of the chocolate and the wine wait a few moments between tastes to appreciate the aftertaste that lingers after you have swallowed both the chocolate and the wine,Food-and-Entertaining

how to blow a bubble with bubblegum,blowing bubbles with bubblegum is a favorite pastime for kids and kids at heart alike it can make the act of chewing gum into a whole lot of fun blowing bubbles isn t that hard the key to success lies in learning the proper breathing technique and how to manipulate the gum with your mouth everyone can do it all it takes is a little practice and technique,buy some bubblegum if you don t have bubblegum you can t make a bubble you can buy gum at pretty much every corner store chewing gums can be used to make bubbles but they won t be as big and they ll usually pop too easily to start off select a pack of bubblegum like double bubble or bazooka generally if there is a picture of a bubble on the package it s a good choice some gums are also stickier making them harder to remove from your face when they pop usually if you chew these gums a little longer before blowing a bubble they won t be quite as sticky gums with less sugar often have a stronger gum base for making bubbles gum bases contain a long molecule that adds elasticity to the gum the right amount will make for the best texture for bubbles 1 x trustworthy source american chemical society scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer reviewed scientific journals go to source avoid old gum if your gum is stale it will be more dry harder to chew and bad for making bubbles use fresh gum to get the best results chew one piece or strip of bubblegum for starters more gum does not necessarily equal more bubble at this stage you re just learning how to blow a bubble so you don t want to overdo the amount of gum in your mouth unwrap one piece and pop it into your mouth chew the bubblegum until it is soft and smooth work it around your mouth chew until the flavor and sugar crystals in it mostly disappear and the bubblegum is very pliable soft and easily bent this can take a few minutes so be patient don t wait too long after a long time perhaps half an hour the bubblegum will deteriorate becoming stiffer and brittle and won t work as well roll the gum into a ball with your tongue use the roof of your mouth to steady the gum in place while you work the ball shape it doesn t have to be a perfectly circular shape just so that the gum is a compacted wad move this ball of gum so that it sits right behind your front teeth use your tongue to flatten the ball into a small flat circle use the back of your teeth to help flatten it by pushing the ball into them push your tongue through the flattened gum open your teeth slightly and extend your tongue until it extends out of your mouth and is covered by a thin stretched layer of bubblegum you ll need to be very gentle or you might poke your tongue right through if that does happen just form the ball again and start over keep practicing as this step can be difficult practice in front of a mirror so you can see when the tip of the gum is in the right position breathe air into the pocket of gum around your tongue 2 x research source blow gently until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and start to push the gum out of your mouth in a bubble shape many people make the mistake of blowing just out of their lips rather than using breath from deeper within lip breath is not strong enough to produce a proper bubble so be sure to put more energy into it the appropriate way to push air into the gum is like producing a heavy sigh use your diaphragm to push the air and exhale pull your tongue out of the layer of gum once the air pressure starts expanding the gum you can remove your tongue the edges of your teeth will help to keep the gum in place keep blowing slow and steady as you gradually expand the gum keep your mouth open resist the urge to close your lips after removing your tongue keeping your mouth in an open position will give you a larger area to push air through keep blowing as long as you can or until the bubble bursts use slow even breaths this will allow your gum time to expand see how big you can make a bubble before it pops for the biggest bubbles blow bubbles inside stay away from wind and hot or cold temperatures cold air and wind can pop your bubble early while hot air can make it so pliable it gets limp seal off the bubble press your lips together slightly to close the bubble this will prevent the bubble from getting more air and becoming bigger than desired or from allowing the air in the bubble to escape if you want to avoid the mess of a bubble popping in your face you can draw the bubble back into your mouth and pop it with your tongue practice practice practice you may not succeed the first few tries but that s all part of the fun just keep trying until it happens for you and you get the hang of what it feels like blowing bubbles can take some getting used to for your jaw mouth and diaphragm with practice you will strengthen the muscles and the process will become easier,Food-and-Entertaining

can be added to salads and the pear tuna which can be treated like a fruit they grow wild throughout the american southwest down to south america and up to canada the ones you may find at a local store or farmers market will surely originate from a commercial nopal farm,buy or forage some prickly pear pads see warnings there s a reason it s called the prickly pear cactus find pads that are bright green and firm small young pads harvested in early spring are thought to be the most succulent delicate in flavor and have the fewest spines the thicker a pad the older it is older pads tend to be stringy and their sap will be thicker which some people find unpleasant leave those for other species who use them as survival food during lean foraging seasons the tender pads are sometimes sold as baby nopales if you re harvesting them yourself wear extremely heavy gloves or use tongs snap the pads off the plant or cut at the stem cutting at the stem reduces stress on the pad and allows the cactus to recover more quickly than snapping or tearing the pad away this helps keep your cactus plant healthy for future harvests remove the spines from the pad by using a vegetable peeler or a paring knife 1 x research source don t take off the gloves until the pads are completely rinsed and the peeled remnants are cleared the pads not only have large spines but there are also tiny invisible and far more irritating spines called glochids that are extremely difficult to remove from the skin the spines and glochids can also be removed from the prickly pear pads by burning them off with a small torch or by placing the pad on a gas burner and turning it with tongs see warnings run the pad under cool water peel or cut off any discolorations or bruises slice or cut the pads wipe

juice if you grill the nopales you might want to coat generously with pepper salt and other spices they re ready when they re tender and slightly browned grilled nopalitos strips can be seasoned with fresh lime juice and a little olive oil you can also add grilled portobello mushrooms to the mix try stirring the cooked nopales into soup mixing them into a salad or omelet pickling them or eating

one to two inches thick with a hard exterior 2 x research source choose a healthy and flavorful stalk look for the best quality in a sugar cane by examining the color weight and moisture of the stalk and inner flesh find the best stalk of what s available for the best taste choose stalks that are light green fading to yellow with reddish brown patches avoid ones that are white cracked or blackened

cutting and eating ask a produce clerk to make a cut at either end of a stalk for you pick one that has off white moist opaque flesh inside avoid dry flesh that is brown or red in color 3 x research source cut a small part off from each end use a sharp knife and cutting board to remove a section of at least an inch from each end of the stalk this will remove the dried out portions from older cuts you may need to score the tough outer edge of the stalk by cutting or gently sawing a few millimeters in all the way around the stalk then breaking it along the scoring rather than trying to chop all the way through you may need to cut more from each end if the ends have become very hard and dried and you cannot access the juicier flesh cut the cane into sections divide a long stalk into several smaller pieces that are easier to work with score and break or chop through the stalk to make pieces of about six inches it will be easiest to cut through sections of the stalk in between the thicker joints keep in mind however that the sections between the joints will also be the easiest to chew or use for other purposes so it s best to keep them intact you can also cut the stalk lengthwise into two four or more thinner sticks for consumption do this before cutting off the outer layer or afterwards if it s easier to do so cut off the outer layer stand a piece of the cane on its end and cut downward to remove the outermost layer of the stalk this eliminates the hard green bark that cannot be chewed cut in about a millimeter from the edge or wherever you see that the tougher green bark is distinguished from the inner white flesh you may be able to peel the outer layer down and off the stalk with your fingers after making an initial cut depending on how easily your cane s bark separates from the flesh chew the fiber to extract sweetness stick a small piece of the peeled sugar cane into your mouth to chew biting the fibrous inner flesh called bagasse will release the sweet flavor 4 x

source once you have chewed the fibrous material and extracted all of its sweetness spit it out and dispose of it use the cane as a skewer try using a thin section of the peeled stalk as a skewer for fruits meats etc this can impart the sweet flavor of the sugar cane into other foods cut sugar cane pieces into thin sticks with a sharp point on one or both ends for optimal use as a skewer you can leave the bark on for greater strength when skewering tougher foods use skewers for dessert items like fruit kebabs or to dip strawberries in chocolate or freeze the skewers to more easily stick them into fish and meats for cooking or grilling the sweet flavor into proteins 6 x research source try the cane as a swizzle stick use the peeled sugar cane as a swizzle stick in any sort of beverage this

source since the chef has already seasoned the sushi it s considered rude to soak an entire piece of sushi in soy sauce soaking the piece in soy sauce also makes it more likely to fall apart try not to mix wasabi into the soy sauce since this is seen as bad manners if the sushi already has sauce on it eat a piece before dipping it in soy sauce you might enjoy the flavor that the chef has already prepared try to eat the sushi in one bite most sushi is small enough to fit into your mouth all at once eating all of the sushi in a single bite will allow you to enjoy all of the flavors of the rice wrapper and fish if the sushi is too large to fit into your mouth you can eat it in 2 bites but you may want to let the chef know that you prefer smaller pieces 8 x research source although some people argue that you must put the sushi fish side down in your mouth you can decide which way to eat the piece pay attention to how the flavors change as you eat the sushi for example you might

want to taste the difference between each of them to refresh your mouth between different types of sushi use your chopsticks to pick up a slice of ginger once you ve eaten the ginger you re ready to taste the next sushi 9 x research source avoid draping the ginger on the sushi and eating them together ginger is sometimes pale white or bright pink if food coloring has been added try a variety of

it s perfectly fine to let your friend know if there are rolls or sashimi that you don t like just try to share the sushi that you both enjoy have fun and don t worry about making mistakes you ve probably heard some hard and fast rules about eating sushi so it s understandable if you feel intimidated remember that you can eat sushi according to your personal preference if you struggle to eat

how to eat intuitively,intuitive eating is a revolutionary movement that involves recognizing the truth about eating and the underlying reasons why your body craves food instead of harsh dieting and food avoidance the intuitive eating movement emphasizes the proper respect for and understanding of the human body and the foods we humans eat if you re keen on understanding your hunger pangs instead of instantly gratifying them and you want to understand when you re using food for its emotional effects you might find that the intuitive eating approach is a great way to change your response to hunger urges and emotional needs,avoid developing a diet mentality it s a truism that many people struggle with cycles of dieting the reality for many following diets is frustration and often dangerous swings of weight gains and losses instead of worrying constantly about the latest diet fad or which diet will make you lose the most weight discard the focus on special diets altogether by shifting to intuitive eating habits instead you ll never have to diet for eventually you will follow a well balanced process of feeding your body what it needs without compromising on the happiness pay attention to your hunger the hunger urge is not an evil negative instinct sadly it has been demonized by the diet industry to seem like something to be constantly purged and ignored hunger on the contrary is a positive instinct that evolves to tell you when you need an energy refill vilifying so helpful and basic an instinct is neurotic when your body feels deprived of nutrients and calories energy it sends hunger signals to the brain if you try to suppress this instinct you risk binge eating foods that are poor in nutrition as a quick fix for that gnawing inside by responding quickly and sensibly to your body s hunger urges you can eat smaller portions feel satisfied quickly and find the energy you need to keep going strong there is a reason for the time proven traditional meal set each day by eating balanced meals every 3 5 hours you ensure that your body maintains a steady level of energy by fueling your body with properly balanced foods you will not experience deprivation in nutrients calories or energy stop avoiding food one of the most common mistakes people make when trying to change their lifestyle is to convince themselves that food must be avoided this battle manifests itself in feelings of deprivation when you feel deprived you are more likely to give in to temptation acknowledge that your body needs food stop punishing yourself instead of constantly labeling yourself as bad or good depending on how many calories you ve consumed in a day or what types of food you ve eaten simply acknowledge that food is necessary and healthy trust your body to let you know what types of food it needs for example if you don t normally eat meat but suddenly find yourself craving a meal of red meat and a fresh spinach salad your body could be indicating to you that you are low on iron and need to supplement your daily diet with more foods that contain higher levels of iron instead of feeling guilty about consuming more calories in the day than you think you should accept that you body knows what to do to balance itself be grateful that you have access to what your body needs not everyone does pay attention to signals of fullness just as the body sends signals to the brain when it needs food and sustenance it also informs us to stop eating when our stomach is full the brain receives a message however many people eat without paying careful attention to their bodies and the signals they receive since it takes the brain approximately 20 minutes to register the food you consume if you eat too quickly or too casually mindlessly in front of the television or computer you may miss the full signal and end up overeating cramming food in to fit around work life isn t healthy either that hot dog bolted down in a five minute break between meetings will leave you hankering for sugary fatty snacks mid afternoon when your energy levels crash find a minimum of 20 minutes for a decent lunch instead if the meetings cannot wait work needs rescheduling not your diet acknowledge the satisfaction of eating foods that you love the best way to immerse yourself into an intuitive eating cycle is to acknowledge that eating gives you a sense of satisfaction and to stop punishing yourself for feeling satisfied by food the guilt that many people have about eating actually creates a secret urge to binge eat what they consider bad foods this gives food unnecessary power which disempowers you in the process acknowledge that eating is satisfying and move on pay attention to feelings many people use food as a comfort agent to deal with problems such as anxiety depression and anger know there are healthier ways to deal with these emotions acknowledging this behavior will help you stop using food as a security blanket use food to fuel your body not to improve your mood or let off steam intuitive eaters recognize the true purpose of food and strive to find alternative methods for mood improvement keep a food diary to help you notice the emotional triggers in your life this can help you to find alternative ways of coping with stressful or emotional moments such as meditation taking a walk listening to music or simply relaxing recognize the limitations of your body not every person is capable of being a size 2 or having a 30 inch waist bodies are built differently some bodies have fat deposits that are curvy some have block shaped fat deposits there is no way to change the natural disposition of your body so it is important to stop trying if you place unnecessary restrictions on yourself in order to achieve a physically impossible goal you will become frustrated and depressed exercise regularly don t think you have to abuse or exhaust yourself just move regularly through physical activity and revel in the differences you experience an active body is a healthy body and a healthy body feels great physical activity is also a very effective way to release stress which can turn into a major trigger for emotional eating if left bottled up for too long match your body shape and stamina to the exercise while one style of exercise may be all the rage it might not be your perfect match try different types of exercise to find what you enjoy doing and what makes a constructive difference to your fitness if you can t work this out alone ask a fitness coach doctor or physiotherapist to help when you click with the exercise you do it will become a lifelong passion and won t feel like a chore again this is an intuitive response gently change your eating habits an about face transformation of your diet can leave you feeling hungry depressed anxious or frustrated instead of trying to revolutionize your entire diet in a few short days simply try to gradually adjust the foods you eat pay careful attention to the types of food you eat the frequency at which you eat and the reasons why you are eating notice which foods leave you feeling sub optimal and lacking in energy equally make note of those that leave you feeling buzzed and alert steer toward the food that makes you feel optimal and good not the food that might be an easy option but that leads to a fast slump,Food-and-Entertaining

movie buff friends to play the 7 degrees of kevin bacon drinking game although you won t need pieces of that smoky cooked goodness to play the game this sport will keep you focused on a different kind of bacon the theatrical kind the idea behind this game is to name a random film actress actor or even director and then follow a chain of thespians until linked to actor and all around icon kevin bacon however you only get seven links the least number of links the better play with two or more people the more people playing the better ask everyone to write down a name of one actor actress or director on a piece of paper and place the paper in a hat the first player randomly selects a name and must track through that celebrity s movie career until he or she is linked to kevin bacon the idea is to link to kevin bacon in the least number of steps up to seven if the player has to name more than seven steps he or she automatically has to drink for example if the player selects tim allen he was in toy story with tom hanks tom hanks was in apollo 13 with kevin bacon only two steps to kevin bacon and most likely this player is safe from drinking each player takes a turn keep track of the number of steps it takes to arrive at kevin bacon the player who had to name the most number of steps at the end of each round has to drink play name that pig with your favorite beverage test your knowledge of famous pigs or pork like analogies with a group of friends depending on the number of players divide the players into teams team a and team b with equal numbers on each side ask everyone to anonymously write down the name of a famous or infamous pig or bacon related person place or thing examples include the movie porky s or the pig from charlotte s web wilbur if you and your pals are feeling a little un pc you could also delve into cop references too it s your game make up the rules at will team a randomly selects a question and then provides team b with one clue for example if the word is porky s the clue could be this place was famously patronized in a 1980 s movie series team b is allowed four or as many times as you desire attempts to guess the answer don t allow too many guesses though as a faster pace is a lot more exciting if team b guesses the answer correctly team a has to take a drink if team b does not guess correctly then they must drink turn to a cooking television channel such as the food network for a fun filled bacon inspired drinking game gather around the television during a favorite chef show featuring barbecue or southern cooking for example the object of the game is to drink every time the chef says the word pork ham or bacon or uses pork as an ingredient designate specific keywords that will trigger drinking such as pulled pork barbecued pork ribs or bacon depending on the dish everyone could end up quite buzzed after a half hour show invite pork loving friends to play bacon toss inspired by games where players attempt to toss pieces of food into each other s mouths bacon toss involves tossing a piece of bacon into the other teammate s mouth if your teammate is able to catch and eat the bacon your team is safe however if your teammate misses you both must drink divide your group into teams of two each player must have an alcoholic beverage and a plate of cooked bacon perhaps eight to 10 pieces teams must stand facing each other with approximately four feet between them one player will act as the catcher and the other player will be the thrower team members will reverse rolls after each bacon toss so everyone gets a chance to perform each roll the thrower will attempt to toss one piece of cooked bacon into the catcher s mouth the bacon can be cut in half or possibly used whole depending on your preference the catcher cannot use hands just his or her mouth to receive the bacon if the catcher fails to catch the bacon in his or her mouth both teammates have to drink if the catcher manages to catch and eat the bacon they can choose another team that didn t catch their bacon to drink which means that some teams may have to drink twice tap into your inner architect and play bacon inspired jenga instead of using wooden blocks use pieces of crispy fried bacon to build your tower then gingerly pull away pieces the person who pulls away the piece that makes the tower fall has to take a shot cook three to four packets of bacon so you have enough material to build your jenga inspired tower make sure each piece of bacon is thoroughly crisped and cooked so it can withstand the building process decide which player goes first by performing a coin toss after the first player has been identified decide play order where you rank may be the difference between building the tower and bringing it to its knees begin the game by having the first player lay the initial piece of bacon on the table each player takes one piece of bacon and builds upon the next if you create the tower without having it fall reverse the process by having each member remove one piece of bacon from the sculpture the person who places or removes a piece of bacon that causes the sculpture to fall has to drink play the bacon eating game based on the chocolate eating game in this game cooked bacon is set on a plate in the middle of the party attendees have disposable knives and forks ready at the side for each contestant as with the chocolate eating game toss the dice around each group member whoever gets a six has to go to the center of the group pour and drink a shot of whatever alcohol you ve chosen this is instead of putting on clothes as with the chocolate game then the person must eat bacon with the disposable knife and fork until the next person throws a six changeovers must be rapid once a six is thrown don t allow delays or the game won t be as much fun this can get very messy if a six is thrown mid pouring so be ready with a plastic sheet over the ground to make eating the bacon a little more exciting try making chocolate bacon have plenty on the plate people will probably scoff it try bacon tasting not so much a game as an excuse to combine bacon with alcohol to mark

how to blow a bubble with bubblegum,blowing bubbles with bubblegum is a favorite pastime for kids and kids at heart alike it can make the act of chewing gum into a whole lot of fun blowing bubbles isn t that hard the key to success lies in learning the proper breathing technique and how to manipulate the gum with your mouth everyone can do it all it takes is a little practice and technique,buy some bubblegum if you don t have bubblegum you can t make a bubble you can buy gum at pretty much every corner store chewing gums can be used to make bubbles but they won t be as big and they ll usually pop too easily to start off select a pack of bubblegum like double bubble or bazooka generally if there is a picture of a bubble on the package it s a good choice some gums are also stickier making them harder to remove from your face when they pop usually if you chew these gums a little longer before blowing a bubble they won t be quite as sticky gums with less sugar often have a stronger gum base for making bubbles gum bases contain a long molecule that adds elasticity to the gum the right amount will make for the best texture for bubbles 1 x trustworthy source american chemical society scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer reviewed scientific journals go to source avoid old gum if your gum is stale it will be more dry harder to chew and bad for making bubbles use fresh gum to get the best results chew one piece or strip of bubblegum for starters more gum does not necessarily equal more bubble at this stage you re just learning how to blow a bubble so you don t want to overdo the amount of gum in your mouth unwrap one piece and pop it into your mouth chew the bubblegum until it is soft and smooth work it around your mouth chew until the flavor and sugar crystals in it mostly disappear and the bubblegum is very pliable soft and easily bent this can take a few minutes so be patient don t wait too long after a long time perhaps half an hour the bubblegum will deteriorate becoming stiffer and brittle and won t work as well roll the gum into a ball with your tongue use the roof of your mouth to steady the gum in place while you work the ball shape it doesn t have to be a perfectly circular shape just so that the gum is a compacted wad move this ball of gum so that it sits right behind your front teeth use your tongue to flatten the ball into a small flat circle use the back of your teeth to help flatten it by pushing the ball into them push your tongue through the flattened gum open your teeth slightly and extend your tongue until it extends out of your mouth and is covered by a thin stretched layer of bubblegum you ll need to be very gentle or you might poke your tongue right through if that does happen just form the ball again and start over keep practicing as this step can be difficult practice in front of a mirror so you can see when the tip of the gum is in the right position breathe air into the pocket of gum around your tongue 2 x research source blow gently until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and start to push the gum out of your mouth in a bubble shape many people make the mistake of blowing just out of their lips rather than using breath from deeper within lip breath is not strong enough to produce a proper bubble so be sure to put more energy into it the appropriate way to push air into the gum is like producing a heavy sigh use your diaphragm to push the air and exhale pull your tongue out of the layer of gum once the air pressure starts expanding the gum you can remove your tongue the edges of your teeth will help to keep the gum in place keep blowing slow and steady as you gradually expand the gum keep your mouth open resist the urge to close your lips after removing your tongue keeping your mouth in an open position will give you a larger area to push air through keep blowing as long as you can or until the bubble bursts use slow even breaths this will allow your gum time to expand see how big you can make a bubble before it pops for the biggest bubbles blow bubbles inside stay away from wind and hot or cold temperatures cold air and wind can pop your bubble early while hot air can make it so pliable it gets limp seal off the bubble press your lips together slightly to close the bubble this will prevent the bubble from getting more air and becoming bigger than desired or from allowing the air in the bubble to escape if you want to avoid the mess of a bubble popping in your face you can draw the bubble back into your mouth and pop it with your tongue practice practice practice you may not succeed the first few tries but that s all part of the fun just keep trying until it happens for you and you get the hang of what it feels like blowing bubbles can take some getting used to for your jaw mouth and diaphragm with practice you will strengthen the muscles and the process will become easier,Food-and-Entertaining

how to eat rice with chopsticks,so you ve mastered eating meats vegetables and sushi with chopsticks but still find yourself thwarted by the simplest food of all rice worry no longer by brushing up on the fundamentals of good chopstick form and learning a few rice specific tips almost anyone can become an expert with a pair of kuaizi 1 x research source,hold your chopsticks sideways rice can be particularly difficult to eat even if you master the chopstick technique above in this section you ll learn a few tricks for making this task easier start by taking the basic chopstick form and turning your hand 90 degrees to the side your chopsticks should now rest above your hand rather than beside it you should still be able to move the chopsticks together and apart easily this makes it easier to support balls of rice as you lift them up to your face it s hard for the rice to fall between two horizontal sticks on the other hand it s a lot easier for it to fall to either side when it s balanced between two vertical sticks lift the rice from below picking up rice with chopsticks isn t so much a pinching motion as it is a combined scooping pinching motion to pick up some rice hold your chopsticks open so that one is on either side of a good sized clump bring the chopsticks together near the bottom of the clump and gently squeeze as you lift it upwards lifting the rice from the bottom makes it easier to handle without dropping any the more tightly packed rice between the chopsticks supports the rice above it turning your set of chopsticks into a sort of makeshift spoon lift the bowl up to your mouth this is usually a big piece of the puzzle for people who are struggling with eating rice use the hand that isn t holding chopsticks to pick up the rice bowl and bring it a few inches from your mouth now transfer rice from the bowl into your mouth with the pinching and scooping method above use the bowl to catch any mistakes this doesn t just make the task much easier it s also considered more polite in many countries that use chopsticks 2 x research source note however that it s considered a little impolite to shovel food directly from the bowl into your mouth pick up pieces of rice and bring them into your mouth don t just put your lips to the bowl and move the rice toward your mouth if you can choose sticky rice not all rices have the same weight and texture for the easiest results try picking a short grained white rice which tend to form sticky clumps that are easier to pick up by contrast brown rice and long grained white rice tends to stick to itself less so it s much easier to drop or spill 3 x research source hold both chopsticks with the side of your thumb eating rice with a set of chopsticks is easiest if you re using your chopsticks the way they were intended to be used luckily this is easy to learn start by lining up your two chopsticks and holding them in your dominant hand slide them into the crook between your thumb and the side of your hand the squishy part at the base of your thumb should pin them in place 4 x research source you ll want the two chopsticks to be lined up on top of each other not side to side grasp the top chopstick like a pencil with the two chopsticks resting in the crook of your thumb slide the top one up so that you re holding it with your thumb index and middle fingers the pad of your thumb should hold the stick from the side your index finger should bend around it and rest on top your middle finger should support the stick from the other side this may sound complicated but it should be fairly similar to how you d hold a pen or pencil if you re having trouble set the other chopstick down so you can concentrate on this one it s easy to slide back in later keep the bottom chopstick steady one of the most important things to remember when eating with chopsticks is that the bottom chopstick doesn t move keep holding it in place with the fleshy part at the base of your thumb light pressure should be find you don t need to keep a death grip on it bend your ring finger so that it supports the bottom of the stick with the side of your last knuckle 5 x research source use your thumb index and middle finger to move the top chopstick maintaining the rest of your form practice bending and extending your middle and index fingers when you extend them the top chopstick should point up when you bend them it should point down and eventually touch the other one 6 x research source practice this up and down motion until you re comfortable with it try to keep your thumb straight as you do this if you bend it to move the top chopstick down it s easier for your form to collapse and for you to lose control of the sticks remember the bottom chopstick doesn t move keep it wedged in place and supported by your ring finger grab bits of food by pinching them between the chopsticks make a plate of food for practice purposes if you d rather not you can also crumple up a few pieces of notebook paper and set them on a plate use a pinching motion of the chopsticks to pick up the food or paper balls between the ends of the sticks and bring them up to your mouth it can take a little practice to get used to the feeling of holding food by squeezing it between two sticks but it should quickly become less awkward if you re using food and this is your first time you may want to lay down a towel to protect against spills don t use your chopsticks like spears to skewer your food once you get the hang of using chopsticks it s a wise idea to learn just a few simple rules for them these aren t absolutely essential but they re simple to learn and they don t make eating any more difficult for example chopsticks are not to be used to poke or spear pieces of food this is considered crude it s a little like going to a fancy restaurant and spearing food on your knife instead of using your fork 7 x research source don t stick your chopsticks into your food so that they point up this resembles the incense used at buddhist funerals so it is considered taboo 8 x research source don t pass another person food chopstick to chopstick in other words don t pick up a piece of food and hold it for another person to grab with their own chopsticks instead put the food on his or her plate this too has a negative connection to funeral rituals in addition when someone wants to give you food offer your plate rather than grabbing it with your own chopsticks don t take food from a communal plate with your chopsticks this is considered unsanitary especially if the chopsticks have already touched your mouth instead use the utensils provided there will almost always be a serving spoon or similar tool handy to transfer food to your plate,Food-and-Entertaining

spaghetti turn the fork to wind up the spaghetti now use your fingers to twist the fork around and around in circles the spaghetti strands caught in the tines will start wrapping around the fork and form a bundle keep winding until you have a tight tidy little bundle of wrapped up spaghetti if you notice other strands stuck to your spaghetti jerk the fork upward and bounce it up and down a few

barrameda this gives the sherry a sharper fresh acidic and even slightly salty taste 2 x research source pick amontillado for a darker drink when a fino or manzanilla is aged for even longer it

tastes good to you a lot of eating sushi is about finding your personal preferences do you like to eat with chopsticks or your hands do you enjoy adding wasabi for extra heat you ll soon find sushi that you enjoy and you ll develop your own way of eating it,sit at the bar if you want to interact with the sushi chef if you enjoy watching how sushi is made you ll have the best view if you re sitting at the bar you can also ask the chef for recommendations or suggestions for a quieter more intimate meal ask to be seated at a table instead of at the bar order drinks or appetizers from the server someone will come by your table or seat at the bar and ask if you d like anything to drink you could order green tea beer sake or water for instance but avoid soft drinks since the sweetness will overpower the sushi if you d like appetizers before your sushi order them from the server instead of the sushi chef try miso soup edamame or wakame salad to whet your appetite decide if you ll order the sushi or let the chef choose the selection although you ll be given a sushi menu that you can order from you may decide to let the sushi chef make the decisions and surprise you if you have any allergies or dislikes let the chef know 1 x research source order sushi rolls if you re new to eating sushi you ve probably seen sushi rolls pieces of fish wrapped in rice and seaweed these are called maki and they re great for beginners who might not feel comfortable eating raw fish a california roll is one of the most popular sushi rolls for beginners since it s made with imitation crab cucumber and avocado 2 x research source a philadelphia roll is another popular roll for beginners it s made by wrapping seaweed and rice around cream cheese salmon and avocado you might see temaki listed on the menu this is like a sushi roll but the rice fish and any vegetables are rolled into a dried seaweed cone choose nigiri if you enjoy raw fish if you already know that you like raw fish order a few individual pieces of sliced fish the sushi chef will drape a slice of fish over a piece of pressed sushi rice this is also a great option if you don t like the flavor of a seaweed wrapper 3 x research source remember that you ll usually only get 1 or 2 pieces of nigiri if you want more sushi order several types of nigiri or order a roll to share pick sashimi if you don t want any rice or seaweed in your sushi sashimi is one of the purest ways to eat raw fish since there are no additional ingredients the sushi chef will place a few slices of raw fish on the plate for you to enjoy 4 x research source it s a good idea to ask the sushi chef what they recommend you might tell the chef what you enjoy and let them give you a variety of sashimi to try clean your hands before eating sushi you can wash your hands before eating or your server may give you a hot moist towel to use before your meal is served wipe your hands thoroughly on the towel and set it back on its plate so your server can take it away 5 x research source many sushi restaurants will also provide another hot moist towel for you to clean your hands at the end of the meal identify the wasabi and soy sauce the server or chef will set down the plate of sushi you ordered but you ll also notice a small empty dish which you can pour soy sauce into and a dab of green paste the green paste is wasabi which you can eat with the sushi to give it a little heat sushi chefs add some wasabi to their rolls so try the sushi before adding wasabi to your pieces you ll also notice pickled ginger off to the side of the sushi it will be pale or bright pink in color pick up a piece of sushi with chopsticks or your fingers although you often see sushi eaten with chopsticks it is acceptable to pick up a piece of sushi with your fingers good sushi shouldn t fall apart when you grasp it with your fingers or chopsticks 6 x research source keep in mind that sashimi is usually only eaten with chopsticks since there s no rice in sashimi it s pretty easy to pick up the fish with chopsticks dip the sushi in soy sauce if you d like to enhance the flavor of the fish pour a little soy sauce into the empty dish on your sushi plate slowly dip the piece of sushi into the soy sauce for about 1 second if you re eating nigiri tilt the fish into the soy sauce instead of the rice so it doesn t fall apart 7 x research source since the chef has already seasoned the sushi it s considered rude to soak an entire piece of sushi in soy sauce soaking the piece in soy sauce also makes it more likely to fall apart try not to mix wasabi into the soy sauce since this is seen as bad manners if the sushi already has sauce on it eat a piece before dipping it in soy sauce you might enjoy the flavor that the chef has already prepared try to eat the sushi in one bite most sushi is small enough to fit into your mouth all at once eating all of the sushi in a single bite will allow you to enjoy all of the flavors of the rice wrapper and fish if the sushi is too large to fit into your mouth you can eat it in 2 bites but you may want to let the chef know that you prefer smaller pieces 8 x research source although some people argue that you must put the sushi fish side down in your mouth you can decide which way to eat the piece pay attention to how the flavors change as you eat the sushi for example you might notice a tender texture at first followed by a slightly spicy finish eat bites of ginger in between different types of sushi to cleanse your palate you probably ordered a few types of sushi so you ll want to taste the difference between each of them to refresh your mouth between different types of sushi use your chopsticks to pick up a slice of ginger once you ve eaten the ginger you re ready to taste the next sushi 9 x research source avoid draping the ginger on the sushi and eating them together ginger is sometimes pale white or bright pink if food coloring has been added try a variety of sushi to see what you like if you re new to eating sushi you might enjoy sushi rolls maki that include cooked fish such as smoked salmon or tempura fried seafood to branch out order a few pieces of nigiri or sashimi including 10 x research source sake pronounced sha ke fresh salmon maguro bluefin tuna hamachi yellowtail tuna ebi cooked shrimp unagi freshwater eel tai red snapper tako octopus communicate with the sushi chef if you re sitting at the bar let the chef know if you re enjoying the meal for example complement their rice since each sushi chef spends years creating their own rice recipe you can also let the chef know if the pieces of sushi are too large or if you d like to try a different style of sushi 11 x research source if you re not sitting at the bar but you want to let the chef know that you enjoyed your meal see if the bar has a tip jar share different types of sushi with a friend you can enjoy a broader range of flavors and textures if you order several rolls or pieces of nigiri and sashimi to share keep in mind that when you remove pieces of sushi from a communal plate use the blunt end of the chopsticks this way you won t spread germs 12 x research source it s perfectly fine to let your friend know if there are rolls or sashimi that you don t like just try to share the sushi that you both enjoy have fun and don t worry about making mistakes you ve probably heard some hard and fast rules about eating sushi so it s understandable if you feel intimidated remember that you can eat sushi according to your personal preference if you struggle to eat

doesn t need to be a total mystery there are two basic ways to pick a melon that s ripened to perfection which involve using your eyes and your hands feel the melon pick it up and feel the weight good melons should feel slightly heavier than they look that means they re juicy and sweet if you tap a melon your knuckles should bounce back if the melon feels hollow or soft that s a bad sign the surface should feel quite firm bumpiness is a sign of irregular watering 2 x research source look at the melon ripe melons should have a field spot which is usually yellowish or brownish on one side which may be slightly flatter this means the melon was allowed to ripen for a while on the ground before being picked avoid any melons with a very shiny green surface which is a sign of under ripeness rinse the outside even though you don t eat the rind of the watermelon it s still a good idea to give it a rinse the knife you use to cut it up will pass through the outside which can still have residual pesticides and other stuff from the dirt on it even if you grew it yourself it s still a good idea to give it a rinse before you cut it up cut melon into wedges or chunks there s no wrong way to eat watermelon the most classic way is to slice it into hand held pieces and eat it right down to the rind but cutting up melon into chunks and eating with skewers or a fork is also perfectly delicious place the clean dry melon on a flat cutting surface you can stabilize the melon with your your hand on the other end of the melon or by placing the melon on a towel use a sharp chef s knife to cut watermelon and keep your fingers clear of the knife as you work check out the next section for different ways to slice up your watermelon watch out for the seeds most watermelons have lots of hard black and white seeds throughout the flesh part of the fun or the challenge of eating watermelon is negotiating these seeds and getting rid of them spit them into a small cup if you re inside or take the melon outside and have a spitting contest in the yard it s hard to do elegantly chill your watermelon watermelon is great but chilled melon in the summertime out of this world if you ve picked a ripe melon storing it in the refrigerator will help to keep it fresh as well as add some refreshing coolness to the melon it s always a good idea it s hard to eat a whole watermelon at once if your group can t finish one cut it into chunks and store them in a bowl in the fridge or cover the melon with plastic wrap and put it cut side up in the refrigerator it ll be even better when it s cool try adding a small amount of salt while it might sound strange some people like to add a very small sprinkling of salt to watermelon the thought is the salt creates a sweet salty contrast that makes the melon actually taste a little sweeter 3 x research source watermelon s pretty subtle though if you want to try salting yours it s important to use a very small portion of salt don t overwhelm the fruit try putting out a little dish of salt and dipping the melon into it rather than dumping it onto the fruit much easier to control the portions add lime juice and chili powder one great way to lively up some bland or underripe melon is chili powder a little spritz of lime juice and a kick of chili powder boom your melon s back in business 4 x research source in a small dish mix the following ingredients and dust the melon gently with a light coating 1 tablespoon of coarse salt 1 teaspoon of ground chile zest and juice of 1 lime cut into large slices trim off one end of the watermelon using a sharp chef s knife then cut 1 inch thick sections off the melon across the middle cut these in half to make two half moon shaped slices or cut again into triangles hold by the rind and enjoy you can also cut down the middle of the watermelon long ways then cut extra long sections of watermelon to dive into they might be messy so it s best to eat them outside some people also like to start in the center cutting the melon in half to get right to the juiciest parts of the melon this can be effective especially if you ve got a really big watermelon there s no wrong way what do you do with the melon in the end piece scoop it out with a spoon cut watermelon into chunks another great and easy way to serve watermelon is to cut it up into bite sized chunks and store them in a bowl cut big slices as normal then use a smaller paring knife to remove the whitish green rind from the melon cut into chunks that suit your taste cut into cubes triangles or other shapes use butter knives with your kids to let them chop up watermelon into animal shapes or letters or use cookie cutters for real fun some people like peeling the rind off before chunking up a watermelon this can be done with a sharp chef s knife and some care stabilizing the melon on a flat cut side or it can be done with a vegetable peeler try slicing wedges one innovating way of cutting up watermelon involves chopping it as you might an onion or a potato 5 x research source this is an excellent way of serving watermelon as finger food at a slightly fancier affair because it ll cause less mess use a small

how to eat pistachios,the pistachio can seem like a hard nut to crack each nut is encased within a hard sturdy shell if there is a crack along one edge of the shell use your fingernails or the half shell of another pistachio to wedge the nut all the way open from the crack if there is no visible crack then you may need to use a hammer or a nutcracker to break the shell open,open a pistachio from the crack if there is already a crack in the nutshell then your job will be much easier first squeeze the two half shells to widen the crack until it won t get any bigger then peel the pistachio open from the crack wedge your thumbnails into the crack and pull them apart in opposite directions use your forefingers to brace the nut so that you can apply more force to the shell 1 x research source try using an already opened shell half to pry open a new pistachio the shells are sturdy enough that you can use them to open one other 2 x research source crack an un cracked pistachio the pistachio is more difficult to open if the crack is very small or if there is no crack at all place the pistachio on a clean sturdy surface like a plate a counter top or a cutting board then gently tap the nut with a hammer or another heavy object until a crack forms in the shell finally use your thumbnails to pull the shell all the way open use a nutcracker if you have one the nutcracker is a tool specifically designed to open up thick nutshells place the pistachio between the two arms of the nutcracker then squeeze the two arms shut to crack the nut consider buying pre shelled pistachios you can buy the nuts already opened if you like which makes them somewhat easier to eat however be aware that pistachios sold in the shell are typically less expensive they may also be more likely to be organic studies have shown that eating pistachios in the shell slows down the eating process and lowers overall consumption pistachio nuts contain three to four calories each fewer than almost any another nut but it can be easy to eat a lot of them when they come pre shelled consider keeping pistachios a slow snack by de shelling them yourself 3 x research source suck on the pistachio shell this step is optional but many pistachio eaters love to absorb the salty exterior of the nut shell before they crack open the meat within put the whole pistachio into your mouth and let your mouth absorb the salt remove from your mouth once the taste subsides you can also suck on the shells after you have separated them from the nut this way you can simply spit out the shell out into the garbage once you ve finished sucking it eat the nut once you ve removed the shell the pistachio is ready to consume you can eat the pistachio raw or you can add it to a larger dish the pistachio nut is relatively soft and oblong the color should be some combination of green brown and purple do not worry if the nut skin appears blotchy and mottled this is normal discard the shells in a separate bowl once you have shelled each pistachio eat the nut and place the nutshell into a discard pile this might be your hand or a cup holder or a separate bowl if you scatter the shells back in with the unopened pistachios they will get in the way when you try to eat more of the nuts serve pistachios in a large bowl keep a separate bowl for shells move the hardest pistachios onto a sturdy plate for cracking use pistachios in trail mix these nuts are small and low calorie but they are rich with flavor and nutrients a handful of pistachios can help ward off hunger pangs which might come in handy during prolonged activity furthermore the nut is a great source of protein and fiber replace fattier nuts pistachios are packed with nutritional value but they contain many fewer calories than fat rich nuts like walnuts and macadamias try incorporating more pistachios into your diet if you are trying to lose weight or if you re just trying be more mindful about your nut consumption one pistachio contains 3 4 calories on average some dietitians suggest a daily portion of 30 grams or about 49 pistachios which translates to roughly160 calories in comparison an equivalent portion of walnuts contains 190 calories and the same portion of macadamia nuts contains 200 calories grind pistachios into nut meal use a blender a mortar and pestle or any food grade grinder you can mix the nut powder into smoothies sprinkle it into your cereal and even use it as a baking ingredient if you are blending the pistachios into a smoothie anyway you can leave them whole and add them directly to the mix,Food-and-Entertaining

battle right chiles are perceived as hot or spicy to us because they contain the chemical capsaicin which enters your bloodstream and essentially convinces your body that your temperature is rising 1 x research source this helps explain the sweating flushing and occasional light headedness that can accompany eating spicy foods carried in oils in chiles capsaicin is also a skin and mucous membrane irritant capsaicin is a natural defense mechanism developed by certain plants to prevent mammals from eating them 2 x research source most mammals take the hint and move on but not us think about why people subject themselves to spicy foods are humans just not as smart as mice pigs and other mammals it probably has more to do with our brain makeup our brain neurons responsible for pleasure and pain are adjacent and possibly interconnected this helps explain why many people get a rush out of risky behavior especially when they can experience danger pain without much risk such as in eating spicy food 3 x research source understand the health impacts of spicy food people tend to assume that spicy foods cause ulcers heartburn and other gastrointestinal discomforts but in fact there is no real evidence to support this if they have this effect on you it is likely just a sensitivity you have like others may have to dairy fatty foods etc 4 x research source 5 x research source indeed there is growing scientific evidence that spicy foods are good for you they may help you consume less calories by reducing sweet salty fatty cravings increase calorie burning by increasing your body s perceived core temperature 6 x research source have beneficial impacts on cardiovascular health and cholesterol levels and surprisingly enough reduce gastric acid production 7 x research source learn to prepare chiles carefully pepper spray does indeed contain capsaicin the same thing in those chiles you want to add to your dinner plate so don t treat them lightly unless you want a taste of what it is like to be pepper sprayed use gloves when preparing chiles or at very least wash your hands thoroughly after handling them protect your eyes and other sensitive areas consider eyewear when cutting chiles do not rub your eyes nose or mouth before washing your hands for that matter if you need to use the bathroom or have an itch in a sensitive area make sure you wash your hands before and after the hottest parts of a chile are the seeds and the inner membranes usually white that hold them in place this is where most of the capsaicin is located 8 x research source scrape these away while preparing a chile if you want to tone things down start small if you grew up on a meat and potatoes diet and don t have much experience with chiles allow your body to grow accustomed to spiciness slowly add a little spice to common foods in your current diet add a shake of red pepper flakes to your soup or put a splash of hot sauce in your ketchup 9 x research source serve diced peppers or a chile based sauce on the side and add it to your food as you eat this gives you maximum control over the spiciness move up the heat ladder if your buddy chows down on ghost peppers while you nibble on a bell pepper it is likely that he has built up a tolerance for capsaicin over time slowly but steadily move up the ladder from milder to spicier chiles 10 x research source you can train your body to adapt to hot weather and you can do the same with hot chiles the scoville scale is the standard guide for heat in chiles the more scoville units the more capsaicin the spicier the chile use it as a guide on what chile to try next 11 x research source eat slowly and savor the spice instead of thinking you can get the pain all over with at once by popping the whole pepper take smaller bites especially as you build up your tolerance dole out the capsaicin in smaller doses so your body can absorb it more efficiently 12 x research source if you don t overwhelm your taste buds with heat you ll be better able to appreciate the range of flavors in spicy dishes don t force it everybody is different like the guy who can drink you under the table without seeming the least bit buzzed or your friend who can eat as much as she wants without gaining a pound some people can simply tolerate spicy foods better than others the idea of no pain no gain might urge you forward but use common sense in deciding when you ve maxed out your body s adaptability to spiciness 13 x research source if you seem to have reached a plateau as you work your way up the scoville scale you may just want to accept that as your limit think of all the spicy foods you ve already added to your eating repertoire got milk if not you may want to pick some up along with your thai take out regular old milk the more full fat the better is perhaps the ideal treatment for the burn of capsaicin milk contains the protein casein which works to wash capsaicin molecules away from the nerve receptors in your mouth 14 x research source cold milk provides a cooling effect for the burning sensation fats in milk coat the tongue and mouth again providing a soothing effect and making the casein a more effective cleaner other milk based products will help as well there s a reason why buffalo wings are traditionally served with ranch dressing mexican dishes often come with sour cream and curries often have a yogurt sauce try other beverages milk is best but may not always be a viable option if you re lactose intolerant or at a sports bar or on a date where ordering a tall glass of milk is not ideal there are alternatives capsaicin is soluble in alcohol meaning alcoholic beverages will help wash some of it and its burn away 15 x research source so here s your excuse to have a beer with those hot wings capsaicin is also soluble in oil so you can try swirling a little vegetable or olive oil in your mouth and spitting it out at home preferably also foods with a higher fat content like dark chocolate might provide some relief sugar water is another option especially at home sweet or salty for that matter flavors help mask the spice and the sugar solution helps produce a coating soothing effect as well add a tablespoon or so of sugar to a glass of water 16 x research source this like oil works best as a rinse that you spit out avoid plain water as whatever cooling effect it may have is countered by the fact that it just redistributes the capsaicin around you mouth or down your throat cool down the burn cold soothes burns whether caused by actual heat or capsaicin you can pre treat your mouth with something cold to help numb your nerve receptors or use it after taking a spicy bite try eating cold fruit which contain sugars or ice cream which contains sugars and casein along with your spicy dish 17 x research source a milkshake might provide the best of all worlds cold fat sugar coating effect and good flavor to boot you can try ice chips to cool your mouth but as they melt they will have the same capsaicin spreading properties as a glass of water soak up the heat rice is served with spicy dishes all over the world part of the appeal is that starches like rice and bread can absorb some of the capsaicin before it can affect you like a good sponge light airy textured foods work best at sopping up capsaicin alternate bites of your chosen sponge with the spicy food some people rely on marshmallows 18 x research source wait out the pain and treat other symptoms if they arise it may seem like the burn will never go away but the effects of capsaicin on our bodies only lasts for about 15 minutes after we stop eating it 19 x research source if other gastrointestinal issues arise acid reflux heartburn gerd etc treat them as you normally would as noted chiles have no unique impact on the digestive system that requires unique treatments try chewable or liquid antacids pepto bismol or other such treatments that tend to work for you if you have frequent heartburn talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the range of over the counter and prescription pills now available most of which are taken daily before symptoms arise you can also take common sense measures like limiting your intake of heartburn inducing foods not eating spicy foods late in the evening since reflux symptoms are usually worse at night and letting gravity aid in your digestion by staying on your feet or better yet taking a walk 20 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

how to drink earl grey tea,earl grey is a type of tea that is enjoyed by tea lovers across the globe derived from the bergamot orange earl grey has light citrus notes that add a unique flavor to the drink to prepare and drink your own cup of earl grey you ll have to steep the tea leaves in hot water for 3 5 minutes from there you can add different things like lemon or sugar to the tea to enhance its flavor for a special treat you can steam milk and add vanilla to create an earl grey latte,measure your tea on a scale if you re using loose leaves if you have tea bags you can skip this step as a good rule of thumb use 6 g 0 21 oz of tea leaves per 1 c 240 ml of water if you like stronger tea use more tea leaves 1 x research source if you are using teabags and want a stronger cup of tea use 2 tea bags instead of 1 if you are using loose leaf tea you can pack the leaves into empty tea bags or tea filters to prevent you from having to strain the tea fill a pot or kettle with cold water always use fresh cold water when preparing tea do not use warm water from your tap or water that has been previously heated and left to cool 2 x research source hot water from the tap contains minerals from your pipes which could alter the flavor of the tea use a pot or kettle made of glass or stainless steel so that there aren t any impurities left in your tea bring the water to a boil then let it cool for 1 2 minutes set the pot or kettle on the stovetop and set it to high keep the kettle or pot on the stovetop for 4 10 minutes or until it begins to boil then turn off the heat and let the boiling water sit for 1 2 minutes so that it cools down slightly below the boiling point 3 x research source earl grey is best steeped in water that is 208 f 98 c or slightly below the boiling point you can use a thermometer to ensure the water is at the exact temperature warm the cup or teapot before steeping the tea pour the hot water into whatever container you re going to steep the tea in swirl the hot water around before pouring it out 4 x research source warming the pot that you re steeping the tea in will ensure that the temperature stays consistent during the steeping process which should produce a better cup of tea place the tea in your teapot or cup if you are using tea bags remove the teabag from the paper packaging before placing it in your tea container if you are using loose leaves you can put them in an empty tea bag or tea filters or you can put the measured leaves into the bottom of your teapot or mug 5 x research source if you place loose tea leaves into your steeping container you ll have to strain the tea before you drink it steep the tea for 3 5 minutes pour the hot water over the tea as the tea sits in the water it should start to become brown leave the tea in the cup and let the flavor from the tea transfer to the hot water the longer that you steep your tea the stronger it will be 6 x research source don t fill the cup or teapot all the way to the top to prevent it from overflowing remove the tea bag or strain the tea if you re using loose leaves if you are using teabags discard the tea bag in the garbage if you are using loose leaves strain the tea through a sieve let the tea slightly cool before you drink it so that you don t burn the inside of your mouth enjoy the tea while it s hot or let it cool and add ice cubes to it later for iced tea 7 x research source drink the tea black to get a pure flavor instead of putting things into the tea to change the flavor drink it black drinking the tea black will give you the strongest flavors in the tea leaves pour sugar in your tea to add sweetness put anywhere from a 2 g 0 071 oz to 12 g 0 42 oz of sugar into the tea and stir the sugar so it dissolves in the tea this will reduce some of the bitter notes in the earl grey and make the tea taste sweeter 8 x research source if you want sweeter tea add more sugar squirt lemon into your tea for additional citrus notes cut a lemon into quarters and squirt one of the quarters of lemon into your tea if you want more citrus notes add more lemon juice to the tea 9 x research source adding lemon and sugar together in earl grey tea is a popular preparation add milk or cream to the tea for added creaminess add a small amount of milk or cream to the tea after it s had time to steep and stir it this will add a creamy flavor and will cut through the floral and citrus flavors of the tea 10 x research source heat 5 cups 120 ml of milk into a saucepan for 5 minutes pour 5 cups 120 ml of milk into a saucepan and set it on top of your stovetop turn the heat to medium high and stir the milk as it heats up ensuring that the milk does not start to boil or burn the milk should be warm and frothy when ready 11 x research source use coconut or almond milk for added creaminess and sweetness pour the heated milk into a cup of steeped earl grey pour the heated milk into a cup of earl grey that has steeped for 3 5 minutes then stir the tea with a spoon so that the steam milk gets incorporated with the cup of tea 12 x research source do not pour the milk into the water before the tea has steeped as milk will often mute the flavors in the tea add a 5 teaspoons 2 5 ml of vanilla extract to the tea and stir the vanilla extract will add vanilla notes and play off the flavors in the steamed milk taste the tea and add more vanilla if desired 13 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

how to pair tea and cheese,if you like tea and you like cheese you may be pleasantly surprised to learn that it is not only possible but desirable to pair cheese and tea together tea and cheese pairing is ideal for the person who loves both as many of the flavors are complementary this is also a great pairing to make if you love cheese but cannot or don t wish to drink wine the standard drink for pairing with cheese,refer to the pairings in the same way as for pairing wine and cheese 1 x research source 2 x research source unlike wine however you don t have to account for acid levels as found in wine or make any attempt to match by region tea and cheese do not usually arise from the same regions again unlike wine 2 x research source for example expect the tannins in the tea to balance out any rich or sweet elements of the cheese while a sweet tea can be balanced by a salty cheese 3 x research source treat the warmth of the tea as a distinct tasting benefit warm tea coupled with the high fat content of many types of cheese can create a creamy and delectable tasting experience 3 x research source be aware of the tannin levels in the tea as with wine tea contains tannins and it is these that are pairing so nicely with the cheese tannins produce an astringent tart taste and also provides color to the tea so you can picture how much tannin is in a tea by its color depth less tannins are found in white and green teas while oolong tea has a mid range of tannins and black teas have the most tannins 4 x research source set up at least three to five types of cheese and paired teas to make the tasting worthwhile 4 x research source variety is especially important if you re holding a party don t just have tea also have slices of bread some crackers and some fruit slices to round out the flavors and choices fresh water will also be appreciated by those wanted to switch to the next flavors pair cheese according to your wine and cheese favorites for example if you like a certain cheese with white wine it s quite possible that the same cheese will pair well with a green tea while a cheese you are used to enjoying with a red wine will often match well with a black tea 1 x research source the same strengths of wine tannins will often transfer across to the strengths of the tea tannins pair salty cheese with sweet teas or floral teas this pairing works well with oolong such as tung ting earl grey or keemun teas 3 x research source 2 x research source a lightly salted goat cheese will match well with green tea and sweet teas such as jasmine or rose scented tea 2 x research source earl grey tea is ideal for really salty teas 2 x research source if you have a favorite floral scented tea pair it with saltier cheese you ll love the complementarity and you may just find a new flavor match that really works well pair soft or semi firm and creamy cheese with milder fresh black tea or soft green teas for example ideal pairings would include a darjeeling or a fresh green tea such as japanese sencha 3 x research source for example asiago cheese pairs well with grassy green tea such as kukicha or sencha 4 x research source match brie with a first flush darjeeling 4 x research source 2 x research source match danish cream havarti with darjeeling 1 x research source match ricotta mascarpone and goat cheese with green teas such as japanese sencha or chinese dragonwell 2 x research source pu erh teas match well with high fat cheeses 2 x research source pair black tea with most types of cheese if in doubt if you re not really adventurous stay with black or oolong teas to be assured of a decent pairing or be slightly adventurous and use green tea 4 x research source pair strongly flavored hard and soft cheeses with stronger high tannin teas for example pair assam keemun ceylon and autumnal darjeeling with full flavored cheeses such as aged and vintage cheese 1 x research source 2 x research source interestingly green dragonwell tea can match well with aged cheese too at least give it a try 2 x research source pair nut like flavored cheeses with teas containing a decent tannin content for example match nutty cheeses with keemun ceylon or dragonwell green teas 3 x research source pair cheddar with black tea for example pair it with earl grey tea with its delightful bergamot undertones 1 x research source match gouda with oolong tea 1 x research source pungent cheese with a full bodied flavor such as gorgonzola and stilton cheeses will match well with pouchong or lapsang souchong teas 2 x research source be adventurous learn to match simply by tasting the cheese or the tea then thinking about what sorts of matches might work for example a smoky tea with a smoky cheese a grassy tea with a fruity cheese etc you can ask for taste tests at both cheese stores and tea stores choose three to five types of cheese for example have at least one cheese from each cheese type salty soft and creamy hard and strong nutty etc arrange from the mildest to the strongest cheese flavors cheese pieces should be cut from the rind to the tip to experience the full flavor range of the cheese not just from one spot 4 x research source keep the slices as thin as reasonably possible this is about tasting so tasters won t be wanting to get filled up choose a range of tea types to pair with the cheeses rillo suggests having two to three black teas one green and one oolong to cover the range of flavor matches 4 x research source arrange the teas from mildest to the strongest flavors good black tea choices darjeeling assam lapsang souchong and yunnan 4 x research source display the cheese slices on plain plates and use plain teacups for the tea this isn t tea party time it s all about the tasting not the

how to create a strong burning charcoal fire,it may seem intimidating to start and maintain a strong fire especially when charcoal is involved however with some basic equipment and knowledge of charcoal anyone can have a professional bbq going,use a chimney starter for an even strong fire with minimal effort chimney starters are the easiest way to get a good charcoal fire and you won t need any lighter fluid either you put paper in the bottom fill the rest of the chimney with charcoal and light the paper on fire the heat is contained in the chimney allowing all the charcoal to quickly catch fire before you dump it onto the grill to use for cooking chimney starters are usually between 15 30 depending on size and can be found online or in hardware stores most professional bbq chefs and cooks highly recommend buying a chimney starter as lighter fluid can influence smoke flavor and is harder to use when making an even heat fire 1 x research source place 2 4 pieces of lightly scrunched newspaper in the bottom of the starter you only need to ball the paper up loosely as having it too tight can prevent the flame from getting enough oxygen the paper will act like a rapid large match for your charcoal starting the fire if your chimney doesn t have a solid bottom place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it fill the top of the chimney with charcoal briquets or wood chips fill the entire chimney up with your favorite charcoal or a mixture of both use enough charcoal for your entire grill as the chimney will ensure that everything is evenly lit for a normal 22 grill this means roughly 40 briquets but simply filling your chimney to the top should be a close enough estimate 2 x research source light the paper from the bottom in 2 3 places use long matches or a grill lighter to protect your hands the paper will burn up quickly but the concentrated flames and hot air will ignite the bottom charcoal which will then light the rest of the chimney 3 x research source place your chimney on the charcoal grate of the grill or a heat resistant surface as it heats up it will get very hot and can cause a fire if left unattended dump the coals on the grill the top pieces are covered in gray white ash as the heat rises in the chimney the coals on top will catch and start to coat with white gray ash it usually takes 10 15 minutes to get hot enough you are then ready to start grilling 4 x research source dump the coals in the center of the grill if you plan on keeping the whole grill surface hot or on one half of the grill if you want separate areas for direct and indirect cooking if you plan to grill for more than a half hour then add several handfuls of charcoal now so that they catch as they others begin to fade 5 x research source make sure the vents are open for a larger fire open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire helping it grow quickly keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly open the bottom vents of your grill and remove the cooking grate get rid of the cooking grate set the top aside and open the bottom vents of the grill you want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even strong burning fire clean out any ash now as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly 6 x research source form a pyramid of charcoal briquettes with the peak in the center of the grill aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid then use your hands or a pair of long handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill once it s hot add charcoal 5 7 piece at a time to get the grill up to full strength for a small portable grill you want 25 30 briquettes or pieces of charcoal when you start cooking for a medium to average sized grill you ll want roughly 40 briquettes for a large or industrial grill you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook 7 x research source squirt a small amount of lighter fluid in the center of your pyramid you don t want to drench your charcoal in the fluid as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick unappetizing smoke simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of 2 mississippi around the center of the pyramid trying to get the fluid in the middle you can also start your pyramid douse the inner briquets with fluid then pile the top of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot a mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid which then imparts a petroleum like tinge to the taste of their food you do not need a lot of fluid just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking these pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch let the briquettes with lighter fluid soak for 2 3 minutes do not light the grill immediately waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal helping it to burn evenly apply a thin second layer of lighter fluid lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places only letting it soak in for a few seconds this is what will catch so you don t want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up you just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire light the fire safely with a long match or electric lighter though lighter fluid is not made to flare up it should still be treated with respect light the pile in 2 3 places where you put the lighter fluid aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible the fire will likely start large with big flames leaping around the charcoals but this is just the lighter fluid burning once the flames die down the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white gray coloring this means your fire has caught spread the briquettes out once they are mostly covered in gray white ash once you can barely see any black the fire is ready for cooking the inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red spread the coals in your desired pattern adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time as a general rule of thumb you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill you want 1 2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area not patches of charcoal or solitary exposed coals charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes if you ve added charcoal wait 5 6 minutes for them to catch since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough it should not take long seal up any unused briquets for next time use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag the additives in the charcoal will evaporate making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid 8 x research source pack your charcoals together for strong direct heat as you cook use your tongs to keep the charcoals together as solitary briquettes will quickly lose heat and do little to keep your fire going you do not want them so well packed that they can t get air but you also don t want them separated like many little islands 9 x research source there are two styles of charcoal placement depending on how you plan to cook even grilling coat the entire bottom surface of the grill with two layers of charcoal this allows the whole grill to reach a consistent even temperature if you re cooking food quickly and don t need any indirect heat for large slow cooking cuts of meat this is the way to go two zone grilling shuffle all of the charcoals into an even pile on half of the grill leaving the other half bare this lets you cook foods quickly directly over the charcoals but also allows you to cook slower cuts by indirect heat on the opposite side of the grill you can also keep already cooked food warm on the empty side of the grill or smoke them with grill top on 10 x research source add coals regularly to keep your grill burning hot don t wait until you re almost out of briquets to add more instead add 5 10 pieces of charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining usually every 30 minutes wait 5 10 minutes while the new charcoal ignites and begins to get a white gray coat on the outside before you resume cooking 11 x research source if you feel like you need more coals add them more coals mean a hotter burning grill add slowly putting on 5 6 at a time until your grill reaches your desired heat keep the top and bottom vents open to get the hottest temperature the more air you get to the fire the hotter it will cook so opening the vents is key to a hot strong burning charcoal fire the more oxygen you give to the flames the hotter your grill will be if you need to control the temperature close one or both of the vents partially closing both of them at once can suffocate your fire and extinguish it 12 x research source closing the upper vent is also useful for smoking as it lowers the temperature of the fire and traps the smoke in the grill around your food empty the ash frequently there is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up adding hardwood charcoal for added flavor and greater heat wood burns hotter than briquettes leading to a smokier flavor and an easier sear it also burns faster than briquettes however leading many cooks to use a combination of the two this allows you to keep the fire burning for longer but still get a hot smokey fire going to sear steaks or larger cuts or meat 13 x research source try hickory or applewood charcoal for the best classic bbq flavor and a strong fire,Food-and-Entertaining
how to grill in your oven,grilling shouldn t be confined just to those warm summer months or homes that have outdoor space to accommodate a grill by learning to use your oven to grill you can enjoy smoky charred dishes all year long,arrange your cooking racks if your broiler is in the oven many broilers are in a drawer under the stove but some are in the oven itself if this is the case adjust your cooking rack so that the top of the broiling dish will be 4 8 inches 10 20 cm from the top 1 x research source the closer to the heat the quicker the cook for example if you want a steak that is more well done put it closer to the broiler for a medium to medium rare steak put it further from the heat if your broiler is in the drawer below the stove you won t need to make any adjustments preheat your oven to the highest temperature and turn on your broiler most ovens will reach 550 f 288 c let your oven preheat for about 10 minutes with your broiler pan inside it this will mimic the inside of an outdoor grill 2 x research source the broiler is essentially an upside down grill but the heat is coming from the top rather than the bottom use oven mitts to remove your broiling pan after it has preheated put it on top of your stove and put your seasoned meat and veggies into it the broiling pan has grooves that will let the fat drip down so the meat doesn t cook in it 3 x research source place the broiling pan back in the oven for 8 10 minutes leave the door to your oven slightly ajar most ovens will turn off the heating element once it reaches a certain temperature which would interrupt your cooking cycle leaving the door cracked helps keep the hot air flowing the entire cooking time 4 x research source like on a grill check on your meat and turn it once while it is cooking most dishes cook in 8 10 minutes so flipping the meat at the 4 5 minute mark will help ensure that both sides cook evenly 5 x research source if you are cooking vegetables this is a good time to flip them too use a meat thermometer to check the meat s temperature chicken and medium well to well cooked steaks should be at 160 f 71 c a medium rare to rare steak can be anywhere in the 135 f 57 c range 6 x research source insert the meat thermometer so the tip is resting in the middle of your piece of meat let it stay there until the monitor registers the heat and stays at the same temperature for a few seconds if the meat isn t done yet put it back in the oven for another 2 3 minutes let your meat sit for 5 10 minutes on the stovetop before cutting into it this lets it keep cooking for a few minutes and will help it retain its juices if you take the temperature again you may notice it has increased this is called carry over cooking and is normal 7 x research source make sure to turn off your oven and broiler once your dish has grilled in the oven use a grill pan like a cast iron skillet that has ridges on the bottom the ridges will give you those grill marks that are so desirable on grilled meats if you don t have one already you can find good quality cast iron skillets for 30 or less at your local department store make sure to buy one with the ridges in addition to the grill marks this gives the fat and juices somewhere to go 8 x research source cast iron skillets retain heat really well which is why they are ideal for grilling in the oven place an oven rack on the lowest rung and preheat your oven let the oven and cast iron skillet preheat for about 10 minutes at the highest temperature your oven will allow which should be about 550 f 288 c 9 x research source putting the oven rack near the bottom of the stove creates more space for the hot air to move around the dish while it cooks put your prepared meat into the cast iron skillet once it has preheated taking the skillet out of the oven for this step will help you avoid potentially burning your arms in the hot stove use fire resistant oven mitts to remove it from the the oven and arrange your dish using kitchen tongs if you are cooking vegetables consider putting them beneath the meat in the skillet to help all the flavors combine together cook your dish for 8 10 minutes in the oven check it after 4 5 minutes and flip the meat over if you are cooking vegetables take this time to flip them over too flipping helps everything to cook evenly and in the shortest time possible 10 x research source use a meat thermometer to check your meat s temperature a safe temperature for chicken and well done steaks is 160 f 71 c for medium rare to rare steaks you will be safe with temperatures in the 135 f 57 c range 11 x research source place the tip of your meat thermometer into the middle of the cooking meat leave it there until the temperature stops increasing this shouldn t take more than 1 minute take your cooked dish out of the oven and turn it off let the dish cool for 5 10 minutes before cutting into the meat to give it time to rest this will help the meat retain

the flavor of the meat in with the veggies use chipotle chilies in sauces to bump up the smoky element you can use whole chilies canned chilies or chili powder the chipotle chili is a smoke dried jalapeño so it is a great ingredient to incorporate in your faux grilling you can also rub dried chili powder directly onto your meat 17 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to barbecue,grilling your food gives it a unique yummy taste as well as those beautiful black grill marks whether you re using a gas grill or a charcoal grill you ll need to preheat the grill before adding your food use a meat thermometer to test for doneness and be aware that your meat will likely continue cooking after you remove it from the grill,use a charcoal grill for a natural smoky flavor a charcoal grill requires coals to be lit in order to begin grilling which can be done using a fire starter and a long match wait for the charcoal to heat up for about 20 minutes before starting to cook 1 x research source when you re done with the charcoal grill close the lid and let the coals cool down naturally before emptying the ashes charcoal grills get hotter and impart a more natural flavor but they re more difficult to clean and keep at a constant temperature opt for a gas grill for an easy to use convenient option a gas grill often uses a propane tank that will need to be properly attached before starting to cook you can do this by connecting the grill s gas line to the propane tank nozzle the gas grill has controls that you can easily turn on and off to light the grill as well as control the temperature and placement of the fire 2 x research source gas grills tend to be more expensive but are easier to work and don t take as long to heat up make sure the gas is turned to the off position before hooking the propane tank up to the grill keep your grill clean and maintained clean your grill lightly before each use and then heavily clean it about once or twice a year use a wire bristle brush to clean food and debris from the tops and bottoms of grates or rods scraping the brush back and forth against the grate to give it a good cleaning 3 x research source if you re using a charcoal grill empty the ashes from your previous grilling session if necessary you can heavily clean your grill by heating up the grill for 15 minutes to loosen any food particles turning the gas off and then using a wire bristle brush dipped in soapy water to scrub the grate clean use direct heat for faster cooking foods if you re cooking something like burgers or hot dogs it s best to cook them over direct heat since they cook faster the section of your grill with direct heat will be the hottest 4 x research source a gas grill will have settings such as low medium and high that you can easily adjust to get the right heat level your charcoal grill will just be set up normally with lit coals underneath use indirect heat for slow cooking meats foods such as ribs are often cooked over indirect heat for the slow and steady smoky flavor set the indirect heat section to low heat on a gas grill or place your food on the side without coals underneath on a charcoal grill 5 x research source for charcoal grills keep your coals or briquettes on one side of your grill the direct heat side and keep the other side the indirect heat side free of coals close the lid for slower cooking foods to keep the heat in preheat your grill 10 20 minutes before cooking to preheat your grill you ll either light your charcoal grill with a chimney starter or turn on the gas to the gas grill let your grill heat up for 20 minutes to ensure it s ready to start cooking 6 x research source a gas grill only takes about 10 minutes to warm up while a charcoal grill will take 20 to preheat a gas grill just turn the dial to your desired heat setting to preheat a charcoal grill light the coals using a flame and flammable material such as newspaper or lighter fluid use quality grilling tools throughout the bbq process when you go to place your meats or veggies on the grill use a pair of tongs or a spatula as these are likely your most useful tools it s also a good idea to have grilling mitts and aluminum pans that you can use as well 7 x research source make sure you re not handling cooked foods with a tool that has uncooked meat residue on it try to flip your food only once or twice to keep in the juices save basting for the last 2 5 minutes of cooking if you re putting a sauce or other liquid over your meat it s best to wait until it s almost done cooking to avoid burning the additional flavor use a baster or brush to apply the sauce a few minutes before taking the food off of the grill 8 x research source test for meat doneness using a thermometer stick the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat keeping it away from the bone you can use either a dial or digital thermometer just make sure to wait long enough for the thermometer to get an accurate reading 9 x research source the internal temperature of poultry should be 165 f 74 c while pork and fish should be 145 f 63 c beef ranges from 140 f 60 c which is rare to 170 f 77 c which is well done make sure you re using a thermometer that s made for meat and poultry remove the meat from the grill once it reaches its ideal temperature your meat will continue to cook for roughly 10 more minutes after you remove it from the grill if your food is close to done take it off of the grill and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into it so that it can continue cooking 10 x research source while your meat will continue to cook a bit after it s removed don t take it off the grill if it s still undercooked learn how to grill vegetables and fruits for great sides lay the veggies and fruits either directly on the grill or wrapped in foil on the grate fruits and vegetables have different densities and cooking times but most should only take about 5 10 minutes on the grill 11 x research source grilled veggies make an excellent side to a meal and barbecued fruits like pineapples or bananas make a good dessert denser vegetables such as potatoes benefit from being boiled before you grill them place the veggies and or fruits on a kebab to easily grill them try grilling filet mignon for a tender piece of meat most people choose thick cuts for filet mignon and it s best to cook them over direct heat use your meat thermometer to test for doneness with the cooking time depending largely on the size and thickness of the meat 12 x research source for medium rare aim for a temperature of 145 f 63 c while an internal temperature of 160 f 71 c is medium put salmon on the grill for a tasty fish it s best if you choose salmon with skin putting the salmon skinless side down on the grill first cook it until it s a little over halfway cooked before flipping it over to finish grilling 13 x research source it s recommended that you cook your salmon to about 125 f 52 c and then let it sit and cook off of the grill a while longer add lemon to your salmon once it s finished for flavor grill chicken wings for a yummy finger food you can put the wings in a marinade before cooking them giving them even more flavor grill your chicken wings over medium heat flipping them over once they look charred on one side the grilling process should take about 20 minutes 14 x research source chicken wings should have an internal temperature of 165 f 74 c just make sure the thermometer isn t touching the bone if you go to take the temperature make barbecue ribs for a classic meal a simple rub makes ribs even better and they cook well when slow cooked over indirect heat if grilling them slowly it can take about 5 6 hours 15 x research source check for an internal temperature of at least 145 f 63 c the size and thickness of your ribs will determine how long it takes them to cook,Food-and-Entertaining
how to create a strong burning charcoal fire without lighter fluid,the taste of lighter fluid can ruin your barbecue and it imparts chemicals on your meat and grill that may not be safe to ingest in large quantities luckily there is a variety of other ways to get your grill going and keep it going that require little more than some newspaper and a chimney starter if you have one,know that inexpensive chimney starters are the easiest way to get a strong fire every time usually sold for under 30 chimney starters use newspaper and heat convection to evenly light up your charcoal briquets you can then safely dump them into your grill and get cooking within 15 20 minutes load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper between 2 and 4 pieces of paper depending on the size of the starter should do don t ball it up very tightly simply crumple it into loose balls so that hot air can fill in the spaces these will eventually light your charcoals if your chimney doesn t have a solid bottom place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it fill the top of the starter fully with charcoal briquets take you favorite charcoal and fill the chimney starter all the way to to the top you should be able to access the paper from the bottom light the paper in several place from the bottom and set it on your grill the paper will quickly heat up and the hot air and burning paper will ignite the bottom coals once the paper burns out the coals will light each other as hot air is pulled through the bottom of the chimney and through the coals 1 x research source the chimney will quickly heat up so place it on a flame proof sturdy surface as the coals heat the grill already prepared for you to dump your coals is a great place as is a brick patio though it will potentially leave burn marks dump the coals on the grill when the top pieces are covered gray this usually only takes 10 15 minutes once you dump the coals you ll be ready to grill 2 x research source most chimneys are dumped by carefully turning them upside down over the grill but higher end models may have a release switch which dumps the coals from the bottom dump the coals where you want them instead of dumping in the middle then trying to move them they may break up and lose heat if they are constantly picked up and moved if you plan to grill for more than 30 minutes add 2 3 handfuls of charcoal now to keep the fire going when you need it 3 x research source make sure the vents are open for a larger fire open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire helping it grow quickly keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly open the bottom vents and clean out the ash you need good consistent airflow to get your fire going as the charcoal needs oxygen to burn make sure to dump any ash as this takes up space needed for proper airflow and to leave the vents completely open crumple up 4 5 pieces of newspaper and place them in the center grill make a small pile of newspaper in the middle of the charcoal grate you can also use the paper of the charcoal bag too paper lights quickly and the flame from the paper will help the charcoal catch if you are struggling to light your fires with newspaper alone soak half the paper in olive canola or vegetable oil the oil will cause the paper to burn slower which may give the charcoal more time to catch this diy solution though far from perfect has a lot of proponents as a natural alternative to lighter fluid 4 x research source place small dry sticks on top of your newspaper kindling which is small wood pieces used to start a fire has a higher flaming point than paper which will help light the charcoal place a handful of kindling on top and around your paper making a little nest of sorts the paper will light the kindling and the kindling and paper together will light the briquets if the sticks easily snap in your hands making a loud popping sound they are dry enough to use have a spare handful of kindling nearby as well in case the fire needs extra fuel if you don t have any stick around use extra paper you may have to keep feeding it into the fire until the briquets catch however so have several pieces handy place 3 4 pieces of charcoal on top of your pile these are going to start the fire for the rest of your charcoal place them near the center and rest them on the sticks as the paper crumbles below you want to still have some flames beneath the briquets while briquets the small square pieces of charcoal will burn for longer hardwood charcoal is easier to catch and burns hotter initially ignite the paper from several places use a match or a fire starter to light several corners of the paper getting a nice bright fire going you should notice the kindling starting to catch in the big leaping flames created by the paper if the stick haven t quite caught as the paper is dying out loosely crumple up 1 2 more pieces and places them on the edges near the sticks get the charcoal smoking if you see gray or white edges of ash on the briquets and the pieces are smoking you re in business this process is slow but it will eventually start a fire keep your lighter fire of kindling and newspaper going until you ve got some ash on the outside of the pieces slowly add more pieces of charcoal to the fire you ve made once you ve got the first few briquets smoking you can start adding more pieces one after the other a strong charcoal fire does not look like a wood fire if you see white or gray ash developing on the outside of the squares you should be good to go you will not likely see however large licking flames 5 x research source keep adding briquets until you have a large pile in the center of the grill the inner briquets for now will be the only hot ones you should see smoke coming up from the center of your pile depending on the size of your grill you ll need a different amount of briquets small personal grills can usually get by with 25 30 pieces medium size grills like the most common 22 grill should have roughly 40 briquets large grills may need anywhere from 1 2 bags of charcoal and will take a long time to get hot using this method wait to distribute your coals for cooking until they are mostly covered in white gray ash the inside of the pile will be glowing bright red with heat this means you are ready to cook add any more briquets you might want if they fire has gotten small and then place the charcoal in it s desired location with a pair of long handled tongs this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour keep your coals close together for a strong burning fire you want to keep the coals packed together where they will conserve heat and burn hot that said they also need some airflow to burn best so don t crowd them so much that they are tightly in a line a loose pile is perfect there are several methods of grilling to keep your fire burning strong even grilling coats the entire bottom of the grill with 2 layers of briquets there are no spaces and everything is added evenly allowing the whole grill to reach a consistent even temperature use this if you need to cook a lot of food quickly two zone grilling allows you to keep half the area open for indirect cooking or warming food you need to shuffle half the charcoals into an even pile on one half of the grill making sure there are 2 3 layers of briquets on the hot half of the grill 6 x research source add more coals regularly to keep your grill burning the coals will be hot enough if they are red glowing and covered white to get fresh charcoal burning do no wait until you re almost out of briquets instead add the rest of the charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining you may have to wait 5 10 minutes when the new coals are covered gray white to start cooking again but this is better than reigniting the grill from scratch if you plan on cooking for a long time you should add 2 3 handfuls of coals every 30 minutes after the first set ignites 7 x research source keep the top and bottom vents open for maximum heat the more air you get to the fire the hotter it will cook fire needs oxygen to burn so the more oxygen you provide the hotter you can get your charcoal fire if you need to control the temperature close one or both of the vents partially usually the upper vent empty the ash as it builds up there is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up consider adding hardwood for added flavor and a hotter fire chunks of hickory or applewood add fantastic bbq flavors and the wood should catch quickly on the hot charcoals while wood burns quicker and hotter than charcoal briquets a combination of charcoal and wood or wood chips is often the best way to a professional fire seal up any unused briquets if you don t use a full bag of charcoal use a clip to seal the top of the bag the additives in the charcoal can evaporate making them harder to light next time especially without lighter fluid 8 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining

brush and soapy water grill brushes can be purchased from your local supermarket that have wire bristles an acrylic scrubber and a metal scraper invest in a grill brush for easy cleaning 1 x research source fill a bucket with soapy water made from teaspoon of liquid dish soap for every quart of water dip the wire brush in the water and scrub away any grimy build up present on the grates be sure to clean both sides of the grates remove any metal plates or coverings over the burners and scrub clean the plates protect the burners and help to disperse the heat to allow for even cooking clean the burner protectors by scrubbing with sponge or scouring pad dipped in soapy water gently wipe any grime off the burners check the holes in the burners for clogs and use a toothpick to dislodge any objects that may be blocking the flow of gas in some grill models the burners are easy to remove for cleaning if yours do not come out easily you can wipe them clean while they are in place 2 x research source scrape any charred drippings from the bottom of the grill surface if your grill has a removable bottom pan you can take it out to scrape all the debris away if the bottom pan is secured in place use a metal spatula or grill scraper to push any burnt scraps through the grease hole and catch them in a trash bag 3 x research source clean the bottom of the grill with a soapy sponge once all the chunks are gone scrub the bottom with a sponge or scouring pad and soapy water to remove any built up grease or grime lots of drippings and food scraps tend to build up under the

how to cook pizza on a barbecue,cooking pizza on a barbecue is both an art and a science and while there are a few things to learn along the way with a bit of practice you can set up your grill roll your dough and barbecue a delicious pizza if you d like you can even serve it along with other grilled treats,confirm that your barbeque has a working thermostat and lid purchase a grill thermometer from a local hardware or big box store if your grill doesn t have a working thermostat it should be able to reach and maintain a temperature of around 428 f 220 c which provides enough radiant heat to cook the toppings if temperatures are too low you will only be cooking the crust from below if your barbecue doesn t have a lid you can use an upturned roasting pan instead try and use a grill with a large flat hot plate slotted grills can still cook your pizza but they re much more likely to make a mess for wood fired barbecues or fire pits you need a fixed frame made of bricks and a hot roasting pan filled with hot coals cover your barbeque with an upturned roasting pan if you have no lid use bricks to create 2 side walls and a back wall each should be 2 bricks high leave the front and top spaces open the distance between the 2 side walls should be small enough that the roasting pan sits firmly and safely on top of them the pizza is cooked by placing it into the space inside the walls and placing the roasting pan on top to radiate heat down onto the pizza practice utmost care with this method to avoid burns remove the roasting pan when the pizza is cooked to access the pizza if it s browning too quickly on top remove it from underneath the pan place bricks around the barbeque to provide a more even heating if you d like you can place clean bricks around the barbecue before preheating to simulate a baker s oven it will take more time to preheat adequately using bricks but the heat will be more even and appropriate for cooking pizza your bricks should be free of any dirt that could burn and wrapped in tinfoil for maximum security preheat your grill to 550 to 600 f 288 to 316 c clean the plate with dish soap before and after use give it at least 10 to 15 minutes of preheat time to burn off any debris if the barbecue is not clean it will smoke the food too much and overpower the flavor of your pizza if your barbecue has no flat plate only slotted or bar grills cook the pizza on a heavy cast iron skillet a pizza stone or other heavy duty and flame proof flat pieces of cookware place 1 pound 0 45 kg of pizza dough onto a slightly floured surface sprinkle some flour onto an appropriate surface such as a peel baking sheet or chopping board 1 x research source either purchase dough from a local grocery story or create your own if you make your own dough wholemeal flours or fine cornmeal make for a more protein rich and chewier dough however they also take longer to cook through roll your dough outwards into a circle with a diameter of 12 inches 30 cm drag the roller in up and down motions along the dough thin crust pizza should be between 0 25 to 0 125 inches 0 64 to 0 32 cm thick be sure to rotate the dough and flatten it in as many directions as possible to ensure a consistent thickness 2 x research source try and create a thin crust most barbecue pizzas have thinner crusts and few raw ingredients because they cook from the base up a barbecue with really good heat control can allow more variations to crust thickness and structure you ll need to experiment to learn what works best with your own barbecue you can precook or pre grill the base in advance and then freeze it the bases do freeze very well so try making a batch of them at a time slice each of your toppings into pieces with consistent thicknesses use 3 toppings at most common pizza toppings include green peppers onions tomatoes and mushrooms you can also use spinach artichokes and other less common options for meats pepperoni sausage and chicken are common if you want to keep it simple make a barbecued pizza by briefly cooking your dough on both sides like a pancake afterwards brush it with herb and garlic oil and either eat it as is or wrap it around other foods cook raw meat toppings before adding them to your pizza this is especially important for seafood and chicken you don t want your meat to come out too rare it s best to place meat closer to the edges of the pizza to cook it faster 3 x trustworthy source national health service uk public healthcare system of the uk go to source use your cooked meat as soon as possible if you have leftovers store it in sealed clean containers on a lower shelf in your fridge at 41 f 5 c or lower keep all cooked meat separate from ready to eat food and raw meats place your ingredients onto a platter with the necessary tools the platter should contain all of your toppings sliced cut or shredded sauce olive oil a cooking brush a spoon and a large spatula 4 x research source a pair of tongs is also useful but not necessary place your pizza onto a peel you can also improvise with a wooden chopping board baking sheet or other flat item to allow the smooth transfer of pizza onto the barbecue plate if you re using a homemade dough and not a pre cooked base try not to allow the dough to rise too much or it will go soft and tear easily brush the top of the pizza with olive oil apply olive oil to your cooking brush and gently brush it along the top of your pizza continue applying until the surface of the dough has a thin layer of oil 5 x research source heat your pizza olive oil side down for 1 to 2 minutes with a lid remove the grill s lid and gently lay the dough onto the grill give your dough about 3 minutes to cook without a lid or between 1 to 2 minutes if you re keeping the lid on 6 x research source lift the dough with your tongs every 30 seconds your pizza should be cooking enough that there are grill marks on it but it shouldn t be crispy flip over your crust using a spatula place a spatula under the dough as far as possible and place your free hand on the unheated top portion of the dough gently turn the dough over and lay it onto the grill 7 x research source your pizza dough should come off easily without tearing if it s delicate enough that it tears or looks like it might keep it on for another 30 seconds and then check it again if your crust is getting browned on just one side rotate it 90 degrees with your spatula or tongs and cook it for another 1 minute brush the top with olive oil and add 1 ladle of sauce pour some olive oil onto your cooking brush and gently brush it over the grilled surface of your pizza afterwards scoop 1 ladle of sauce onto the pizza and use the bottom of a spoon to spread it evenly across 8 x research source you can use more than 1 ladle if you like extra sauce but you risk the pizza getting soggy add your toppings and cheese onto the cooked side start by layering your toppings evenly around the pizza afterwards sprinkle your cheese over the top of the pizza and if you re adding meat add it on top of the cheese avoid flooding your pizza with toppings particularly cheese and different sauces cheese caramelizes quickly

well for those in the city with smaller grills they last a lot longer than chips although they take longer to ignite logs are full pieces of wood if you have a barbecue pit logs can work for you however logs are more suited for things like campfire and chunks can work just as well for grilling in a barbecue pit soak the mesquite first if using chips if you can t find wood sources other than chips chips require soaking with water before use this can help chips burn for longer before using your chips soak them in a covered bath of water for 30 minutes before use 3 x research source put a smoker box in place if you have a gas grill a smoker box is a device that holds the wood chips while you grill it holds the chips on top of the top of the grill gates so they can ignite and smoke if you don t have a smoker box purchase one at a department store or online before attempting to grill with wood 4 x research source if you re using a charcoal grill a smoker box is not necessary add a water pan a water pan is a small tinfoil bowl that helps create a moist environment for smoking that helps meat cook 5 x research source to use a water pan fill the pan with hot water set it either under your meat or over your fire when you start grilling 6 x research source work with dry wood only unless you re using chips your wood should be dry before you begin the burning process wood that

x research source if the grill becomes too warm or too hot adjust as necessary for a grill that s too warm close the vents this will reduce the oxygen level and then reduce the temperature for a grill that s too cold open the vents to increase oxygen flow avoid lifting the lid for the most part simply let your meat grill as you near the end of cooking time which varies depending on the type of meat you re cooking it s okay to peek to make sure the meat s not burning however as long as the temperature is stable and the meat is in the beginning or middle of cooking leave the lid on lifting the lid too often can can cause the coals to burn out too quickly 12 x research source check the meat for a smoke ring once your meat is done cooking look for a smoke ring the smoke ring is a light layer of pink just underneath the surface of the meat this does not indicate the meat is not cooked through it occurs due to a chemical reaction between the smoke and meat and is a sign your meat has barbecued

how to grill,millions of people around the world grill their food sometimes out of necessity often out of passion many see grilling as a way of getting back to their caveman roots a test of skill and a matter of pride still there is so much more to grilling than throwing a few burgers on a fire only experience can make you a master but this article will give you a great head start,select your type of grill there are two options to choose from gas or charcoal 1 x research source gas grills are the most commonly used grill today many find them more convenient than charcoal as they start instantly and fuel purchases are needed less often when selecting a gas grill be aware of heat output btus and construction charcoal grills are still popular and preferred by many purists charcoal offers better heat control which means more versatility and many find that good charcoal gives food a better grilled flavor look for heat control construction and style there are two main styles of non portable charcoal grill kettle and traditional kettle grills are great for straightforward grilling and small smoking applications more traditional rectangular charcoal grills are more versatile when it comes to setting up different zones of heat and smoking of larger products but also typically take up more space the grill needn t be yours public park grills avoid mess expense and fire hazard but they typically have a simple design without a charcoal grates straight air path and ash discharge a simple but less efficient larger bed of burning charcoal or a small grate to stack the charcoal on cleaning the ash from underneath first can mimic this an accessory blower can bring a little pile to a quick start and searing glow consider heat output heat output is what defines a proper grill you want a grill that can put enough heat out to quickly sear a piece of fillet mignon or keep a low heat to thoroughly roast a piece of meat 2 x research source heat output in gas grills since most grills allow for fine adjustment of gas flow it s best to get the highest output you can afford this will allow you to put a quick sear on food that you don t want to cook through think of a really good cut of beef a tuna steak or scallops heat output in charcoal grills heat control is achieved by charcoal amount placement air flow and level it s best to find a grill that allows for adjustment of the height of the charcoal tray crank mechanisms are the best option but hook and lever methods also work fine look for at least two adjustable vents as well opening them for more oxygen makes for a hotter fire closing them cools the fire somewhat and also deprives flames of oxygen helping to stop flare ups consider the size of grill you want will you be cooking for an army or just for a family of 2 or 4 it s relatively easy to cook a small meal on a large grill but the opposite is not true look for how much cooking area your prospective grill has the average grill has around 600 square inches of cooking space and will serve a small party fairly well if you host big cookouts shoot for 800 square inches or more if you really only want to toss on a few burgers once in a while the smallest you ll find without going hibachi style is maybe 400 square inches consider the materials used to make the grill in particular look closely at the grill grates most grill grates are made from either cast iron porcelain or stainless steel cast iron is the best for conducting heat but it requires care to keep it from rusting porcelain coated metal steel or cast iron grates do well at conducting heat but must be cleaned with something other than steel typically a brass brush is used to avoid damaging the porcelain and leaving the metal underneath vulnerable to rust stainless steel grates are easy to clean without the worries of cast iron or porcelain but can wear out faster than well maintained cast iron or porcelain pay attention to additional features do you want a rotisserie a smoker box an external burner infrared cooking pay close attention to the number of burners a grill has more burners equals more versatility look for good wheels preferably larger not tiny casters if you re going to be moving your grill around at all features found on gas grills most gas grills have a built in thermometer while charcoal grills do not thermometers are quite useful for smoking and roasting applications they can however be purchased separately and installed if your grill does not come with one features found on charcoal grills helpful features in the construction of charcoal grill include easy access to ashes be it through a drawer or a dumping mechanism determine your grill s location there should be a couple of feet of clearance between the hot box and anything flammable your grill should not be directly underneath low hanging trees or a low roof and it should not be against deck rails as all of these things could potentially catch fire place a fire extinguisher or hose near your grill in case of emergency keep flammable materials far from the fire and never leave your grill unattended start your fire ahead of time you don t want to have to wait for the grill to heat up when everyone else is ready to eat and all the side dishes are prepared keep in mind that charcoal takes longer than gas to heat up shoot for 10 minutes of preheating with gas 20 to 25 with charcoal turn your grill on or light your charcoal if you have a charcoal grill there are several different ways you can start your fire know that when the coal is lightly ashed over and gray you can begin cooking ever popular lighter fluid works but it is imperative that you let it all burn off before cooking unless you like the taste of petroleum electric starters are also available which use a cal rod style heating element placed under the coals they work very well but do require a source of electricity and cords can present a trip burn hazard if not carefully monitored chimney starters use a metal cylinder with perforations to hold the charcoal on top and a couple of sheets of newspaper on the bottom they work quickly and are inexpensive light the newsprint and the heat flows upward igniting the coals have a place to put the chimney after use as it will be red hot another benefit to chimney starters is that they can be used to prepare extra charcoal if you need to refresh your pile just be sure to do it on top of a very heat resistant surface such as a cinder block or the bottom of an upturned galvanized steel bucket close the grill allow the bars to heat for a minute or so to be able to make nice grill marks on whatever you are grilling brine or marinate your meats before cooking this is optional but brining or marinating meat and then placing the meat on the grill will result in a whole lot of flavor 3 x research source brining will especially make for more juicy pork chicken or turkey a basic brine is about 1 8 cup of table salt to 1 quart of water make sure you have enough to cover the meat broth may be used instead of water adjust for salt a little sugar honey brown sugar molasses may be added if desired seasonings almost anything can also be added for more flavorful meat if marinating be sure your marinade does not have too much sugar or else it will burn on the grill add the food to the grill placement is key when grilling particularly if you are feeding a large party if you re cooking for a lot of people try to be deliberate in your placement of food so that you can maximize the amount cooking all at once that said do not crowd the food together as it needs some space both for better cooking and for you to be able to snatch it out or flip it pay attention to hot spots some grills will have sections that get hotter than others keep that in mind when grilling particularly if someone you are cooking for has a special preference regarding how rare he she like his her food once you ve added the food do not flip it or move it unless you want to turn it slightly for cross hatched grill marks until you believe it s halfway done 4 x research source if someone likes their burger more rare than the rest put theirs on the side that s cooler if your grill is pretty evenly heated just put the food on slightly later than the rest to make it rare stop flame ups flame ups are caused by fatty foods dripping onto the fire you can stop flame ups by removing the meat from the grill once the oil has risen to the surface of the meat shake the meat of it s grease then put it back on the grill at a lower heat flip the food when it is halfway done try to limit flipping the food as much as possible frequent flipping can lead to uneven cooking ugly food and or losing a piece of food to the flames below ensure that your food is cooked all the way through 5 x research source experienced grillers don t need to check the food very often but until you re comfortable a thermometer plunged into the center of the food is the best method to be sure instant read for small items probe style if you re grilling a large item such as a whole chicken or pork tenderloin if you don t have a thermometer you can cut into the food but keep in mind that slicing piercing or breaking a piece of food in half will make it dry out very quickly as all the juices will run out of it grilling burgers burgers made of beef are best cooked to medium or well done because of the risk of bacteria being ground into the meat if you grind your own beef from carefully trimmed cuts this precaution is not necessary burgers made of chicken or turkey should be cooked fully veggie burgers should be cooked so that they are heated all the way through grilling hot dogs grill hot dogs on a medium high heat grill they should cook for five to seven minutes before they are ready to be taken off 6 x research source grilling steak steak is often eaten raw when it s provided by a trusted source cook your steak to the desired doneness over a very hot grill the internal temperature of a rare steak should be 130ºf 54 4ºc grilling poultry chicken and turkey must be completely cooked before eating if any of the meat is not opaque it must be cooked further in the case of a whole bird a probe thermometer plunged into the deepest part of the breast must register that the bird is done the internal temperature of a whole chicken or turkey should be 165º 170ºf 73 8º 76 6ºc another classic way of checking a bird s doneness is to pierce the meat and ensure that the juices run clear keep in mind that when piercing the meat you will lose some of that yummy juice grilling pork pork in the united states no longer has to be cooked well done to be considered safe a slight pinkness in the meat is both desired and delicious a medium done pork roast has the internal temperature of 145ºf 62 7ºc in other regions of the world it may be wise to continue cooking until the meat is opaque grilling vegetables grilling vegetables is a great way to make a hot side dish without heating up the kitchen most veggies do just fine on the grill if sliced tossed in a little oil salt and pepper and grilled keep in mind relative cooking times as say carrots will take a lot longer than zucchini purchase a perforated metal grill topper if your veggies are narrow enough to fall through the grates you could also wrap your veggies in tinfoil and place them on the grill just know that they won t get any grill marks that way grilling with sauces most sauces especially high sugar ones such as barbecue sauce should be added at the last minute to avoid burning baste turn the food over and baste the other side wait for a minute or so for the sugars to caramelize if you wish but do not leave it too long as burnt sugar is not very tasty remove your food from the grill put the food on a plate platter or other vessel and cover it with heavy duty aluminum foil if you don t have starving guests hovering already for at least 5 minutes doing this allows juices to redistribute so that they do not run out as soon as the food is cut or bitten into in the case of large cuts taking the food off the grill and covering when the thermometer registers 5 degrees 10 for an exceptionally large item less than the recommended or desired doneness is a good idea as resting it will allow carryover cooking to finish the job the meat continues to cook after it is taken off the grill as it is still incredibly hot a large piece of meat cooked to exactly the right doneness temperature on the grill will invariably be overcooked by the time that it hits the table serve your food immediately after the resting period is over a successful meal will of course have side dishes and beverages that you prepared ahead of time or alongside the main course don t forget the condiments turn your grill off if it is a gas grill do not forget to turn the propane off or else the tank will continue to leak propane take care of your grill once it has cooled down use a wire brush to scrub off the bars use a damp or oiled cloth and tongs to do the fine cleaning if your cloth was wet not oiled be sure to use some cooking spray on the grates afterward keep your grill area clean keeping your grill and grill area clean dry and uncluttered is not just aesthetically pleasing but safer and cost effective grills will deteriorate quickly if left wet and out in the rain especially charcoal ones because wet wood ash is caustic and will rust through the grill very quickly keep your grill safe while in disuse wheel your grill inside as soon as it is cool or purchase a

type of poultry leftovers or casseroles need to be heated until they reach a temperature of 165 f 73 9 c whole cuts of meat like steaks need to be cooked until they are 145 f 62 8 c people may want them cooked to a lower temperature but to ensure they re safe to eat cook foods longer do not reuse marinades or dishes remember to not recontaminate foods that have been cooked to a safe temperature pay attention to what fork or dish you use for cooked and raw foods set aside one set of utensils for raw foods and one for cooked foods once you put the foods on the grill go ahead and swap out the tools and utensils used on the raw food for fresh tools and utensils also get out a new set of plates or platters to serve your cooked foods do not place them on platters that have been used to hold raw foods the same goes for marinades dump marinades down the drain that are leftover from being used on raw foods if you want to keep some of your marinade separate it before you put the meat in it,Food-and-Entertaining
how to make healthy grilled food,grilling can easily be almost as healthy as any other cooking method if you do it right the distinct culprit that makes grilling unhealthy is the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons which is a component of gasoline that causes cancer this is because the fats in food can be converted to various substances normally found in gasoline through the high direct heat levels using the steps below will not only reduce the formation of such substances but will also lower the fat content of the food a badly grilled piece of meat can easily contain more carcinogens than an equal sized amount of tobacco,try to avoid using lighting fluid use a gas grill instead if you elect to use charcoal put the coals on the gas grill and let the gas ignite the coals lighting fluid is made from gasoline and contains many of the same components choose cuts of meat that contain less fat the worst substances are all formed from fat dripping onto the hot coals causing flareups which also compromise the taste buy cuts of lean meat such as sirloin or london broil and avoid cuts that contains large pieces of fat that are hard to remove such as beef chuck ground beef is one of the worst things to grill because it contains very high amounts of fat and must be grilled to well done meaning that not only will there be a lot of flare ups but the meat will be subject to the burning for a long time trim all visible fat off of the meat to be grilled remove the skin off of poultry use all of this scrap in soup don t throw it away bones increase cooking time and should be removed if possible some pieces such as chicken drumsticks cannot have the bones removed choose visually smooth cuts of meat without any nooks or crannies rough meat causes uneven cooking and makes more fat drips marinate the meat after trimming the fat and bones if it is at all possible the easiest way to marinate it by opening a bottle of italian dressing pouring it in a plastic bag and putting the meat inside for 8 24 hours in the fridge reduce cooking time this can either be done by pre cooking the meat to a certain extent by pan frying or microwaving or simply serving the meat at a lower level of done ness remember all pork chicken and ground meat of any kind must be cooked to well done if you must grill burgers pan fry it until it is medium well and transfer it in the last 5 minutes to the grill grill at as hot as the recipe can allow without burning the food this reduces the time of cooking lets the meat retain more juices meaning less drips and makes it more flavorful open the grill once every 3 4 minutes if possible to prevent over smoking of the meat if a large flareup does happen find the offending piece and finish cooking it the pan fried way take the food off the grill as soon as it is finished cooking and let it sit somewhere else for for the juices inside to settle eat enjoy a piece that is cleaner and more flavorful than on another person s grill finished,Food-and-Entertaining

how to make outdoor grilling healthier,in spite of the happy associations and with the increased popularity of cooking out it is important to understand that there are some health risks associated with this cooking method this is because the combination of animal protein and high heat produces certain chemicals that may cause inflammation damage to dna and therefore a higher risk of developing cancer and other diseases these risks seem to increase as we age since our bodies are less able to deal with these toxins here are some steps to take for healthier grilling,reduce cooking temperature by waiting until your charcoal is a bed of hot embers or by turning the gas down on your gas grill partially cook meat in the oven or on the stove to shorten time on the grill to produce fewer carcinogens marinate meat before grilling to decrease cooking time and reduce formation of toxic chemicals particularly with acidic marinades such as those with lemon juice or vinegar turn meat often on the grill using a tongs rather than a fork since poking the meat may cause dripping fat and flare ups which can deposit carcinogens onto the meat move meat farther away from the fire by using a cedar plank or elevated rack use a meat thermometer to know when meat is thoroughly cooked but not overcooked since the longer you cook the meat the more toxins will form choose leaner cuts of meat that will drip less and cause less charring and don t eat the charred portions of grilled meat as they contain a known carcinogen grill more vegetables and even fruits with your meat since they don t produce the same toxic chemicals that grilling meat does as an added bonus fruits and vegetables contain phytochemicals which help reduce the effects of those toxins clean your grill since carcinogenic residue can build up and be deposited on the food limit grilling to special occasions such as picnics or backyard barbecue parties rather than making it a regular cooking method,Food-and-Entertaining
how to light a charcoal grill,it s summertime and you re at the charcoal grill feeling the pressure of cooking meat and vegetables to perfection for your family and friends the first step is to figure out how to get the fire going preferably without scorching yourself in the process with a bag of charcoal and some lighter fluid or a charcoal chimney plus a good amount of patience you ll be on your way to grilling up a delicious meal,remove the lid and cooking grate this will allow you to reach the bottom charcoal grate 1 x research source clean out ash and dirt from the grill sweep out any leftover debris at the bottom of the grill and collect them in a trash bin open the bottom grill vent this will let air get to the charcoal and help it burn you can partially close the vent you start to grill your food to regulate the temperature of your coals while cooking but allow enough oxygen to reach the coal so that the fire doesn t go out you can also use the lid and lid vents to control the fire s temperature use briquettes for an easier faster light many people prefer briquettes because they catch easily burn longer and are inexpensive 2 x research source choose hardwood charcoal for a more intense flavor hardwood charcoal burns out faster than briquettes but gives your meat a delicious smoky flavor 3 x research source use a mix of briquettes and charcoal you ll still get the classic barbecue flavor of the charcoal but combined with the long lasting burn of the briquettes 4 x research source group the coals in a pyramid shape at the bottom of the grill the heat can rise from the bottom and the coals will help light each other spreading the heat from one coal to the next 5 x research source pour out enough charcoal or briquettes to form an even layer on the bottom of your grill use more coal in cold or wet weather for a longer burn pour a generous amount of lighter fluid onto the coal let it soak in for 3 5 minutes so that when you light the grill the lighter fluid doesn t burn off the coal immediately 6 x research source pour carefully to avoid getting lighter fluid on yourself if you spill any while pouring change clothes or thoroughly clean up the spill before lighting the grill if you don t have lighter fluid place a piece of newspaper doused in vegetable oil under the charcoal and carefully light it with a match or lighter add a little more lighter fluid to moisten the fuel this will help the coals light more quickly light the charcoal carefully with a long match or long lighter light it in 1 3 places on the moistened coal and allow it to spread to the drier coal 7 x research source let it burn for 10 15 minutes the coal will heat up and the lighter fluid will burn off you re ready to start cooking once the coal is a white gray color and glowing red at the center 8 x research source wait until the coals are ready to begin grilling if you start cooking your food before the lighter fluid burns off your steak or chicken will taste like petroleum 9 x research source do not add more lighter fluid to your grill once the coals are burning it won t make the fire heat up faster and you may burn your hands arrange your charcoal with tongs the briquettes should spread out on the bottom of the grill slightly past the area where you place your food to allow for even cooking 10 x research source for vegetables and thinner meat like chicken spread the charcoal evenly on the bottom of the grill to grill thicker meat like steak make the charcoal higher on one side than the other you will start cooking the meat on the side with more charcoal when the outside is cooked to your preference finish cooking the meat on the side with less charcoal replace your cooking grate your coals are heated and your grill is ready to go time to barbecue fill the chimney with charcoal pour in enough charcoal to reach about to the top of the chimney or just below it 11 x research source stuff newspaper in the bottom of the chimney crumple the newspaper loosely and stuff it so that the bottom of the chimney is full but not too tightly to suffocate the flame 12 x research source place the chimney on the cooking grate and light the newspaper use a match or lighter and wear heat safe rubber gloves 13 x research source let the charcoal burn until it s white gray with ash give it about 20 30 minutes to burn supervising the flame closely 14 x research source pour the charcoal onto the grill when it s white and ashy lift up the grate and set it aside then use heat safe rubber gloves to pour the charcoal into the bed of the grill arrange the coal with tongs and replace the cooking grate on top the charcoal will be very hot so be careful not to spill,Food-and-Entertaining
how to store a propane tank outside,propane is commonly used for gas grills and can be found in many homes since propane is a highly flammable gas it needs to be stored safely outdoors by using the proper storage techniques you can keep your tank in working condition for years to come just make sure your tank isn t damaged before you store it,don t leave your tank inside or in a shed if gas were to leak it would contaminate the area and make it dangerous even the spark of starting a vehicle or lawnmower could ignite a propane leak and cause a terrible accident 1 x research source if you live in a snowy area mark the location of your tank in case it gets buried so you can easily find it and clear away the snow preferably the tank should be stored under a waterproof cover inside a tank box sold for that purpose or under an open air cover in order to minimize rust and tank damage store the tank in a dry well ventilated outdoor area make sure that the area is flat so the tank doesn t tip over or roll away and the area is mostly shaded consider using one of the lower shelves on an outdoor shelving unit mounted to a secure wall always store a tank upright since the over pressure vent must be in contact with the propane vapor not the liquid keep your propane tank out of enclosed spaces gas may leak and could make the area dangerous keep your tank above 40 f 40 c in cold months as the temperature drops the pressure in your tank will lower make sure the propane tank is in a sunlit area so that it can warm up everyday but see below regarding warmer months keep your tank full so the pressure does not drop too low don t cover your propane tank to try to insulate it this only blocks the sun and could lower the pressure more never use a heater or electrical device to warm up your tank avoid keeping your tank in temperatures above 120 f 49 c as the temperature rises the pressure inside your tank rises too don t leave your tank in the sunlight during the hottest months try to find an area that has a lot of shade instead keep your tank out of the rain to avoid rusting and tank damage propane tanks have a release valve that will help relieve pressure if temperatures are consistently high the built up pressure will leak out and dissipate into the air to work properly and not leak liquid propane the tank must remain upright make sure there are no sources of ignition near the tank so excess pressure does not light place your tank 10 feet 3 0 m away from flammable materials this includes open flames or any electrical device do not store any extra tanks close together or near your grill if one tank happens to ignite you do not want other tanks nearby to ignite as well use a milk crate to hold the propane tank upright keeping the tank upright ensures that the valve does not get damaged and gas doesn t leak a standard sized milk crate should hold a 20 pounds 9 1 kg tank that s used for gas grills 3 x research source special platforms to hold propane tanks are also sold in home and garden stores or online use a platform if your tank does not fit inside of a milk crate build a barricade around the tank with cinder blocks or bricks but make sure to leave the valve and handles exposed keep your tank away from the vents and windows of your home never store or use your tank inside the home look for exterior vent grates anywhere near your propane tank propane gas is heavier than air so it will sink closer to the ground and may go into vents or basement windows in case of a leak you do not want to place tanks in an area where it could easily enter your home and contaminate the air and which might create an explosive mixture situation 4 x research source never store your propane tank near air conditioners radiators or heat vents since they could pull the gas into your home if propane leaks into your home evacuate the area immediately and call your local officials attach your tank to your grill for an easy storage option turn the valve off on top of your tank and turn all grill valves to the off positions use a grill cover to protect it from the elements and direct sunlight this makes it easier for you to use the grill at any time of the year 5 x research source if you store your grill in a shed or garage remove the tank and leave it in a suitable place outside ensure the valve is closed when the tank is not in use turn the valve clockwise until it is hand tight this helps prevent any possible gas leaks from escaping the tank 6 x research source if you smell something similar to rotten eggs or a skunk s spray propane may be leaking from your tank check the valve to ensure that it is turned off snugly if there is still evidence of a leak have the tank examined by a professional to determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced if the leak is only evident when the valve is on check for a leak at the line connection to the tank be sure the connection is tight or for leaks along the length of any flexible line where it may have been mechanically damaged or chewed by a rodent if a fuel line is damaged or the connection to the tank cannot be properly sealed replace it remove any shrink wrapped plastic label to look for rust use a pair of scissors to cut the plastic wrap around off of the tank water can get trapped underneath the sleeve and cause rust to form rust damage can ruin the integrity of the tank making it more prone to damage 7 x research source save the label since it will have important graphics and handling instructions which you may want to consult later on inspect the tank for dents or peeling paint any external damage could ruin the integrity of the propane tank overall if you find signs of rust dents or peeling paint replace your propane tank before you store it 8 x research source do not fill a tank that has been weathered or damaged have any tank over 10 years inspected by a professional the tank is stamped with an expiration date an expired propane tank needs to be re qualified and should be checked that it s still safe for you to use even if there doesn t seem to be any damage it may have internal wear and tear after an initial inspection have your tank checked every 5 years afterward the inspector should re stamp the tank with a new expiration date,Food-and-Entertaining
how to use a grill pan,grill pans provide a great way to mimic the experience of outdoor grilling they re especially useful for people who live in apartments however using a grill pan is different than cooking with regular stovetop pans there are several things you need to do so your food cooks properly and has char marks and a grilled taste ultimately by preparing your pan and food taking steps to properly gill your food and seasoning and storing your pan you ll be able to use your grill pan to its full potential,pick a pan with raised ridges generally grill pans with dramatically raised ridges are better than those with gentle or shallow ridges ultimately the deeper the ridges the more dramatic your sear mark in addition the larger the ridges the more grill like your final product will appear look for a grill pan with ridges that are taller than 1 2 centimetre 0 20 in 1 x research source choose a cast iron pan cast iron pans tend to retain more heat than pans with a nonstick surface in addition cast iron pans tend to mimic the grill better than nonstick surfaces finally cast iron pans will sear your food better than nonstick pans while nonstick pans are easier to clean they won t cook your food the same way 2 x research source avoid using a cast iron grill pan if you have a ceramic stovetop go with a square shaped grill pan round grill pans work fine but they offer less surface area than square grill pans with a square grill pan you ll have more room to cook your favorite meats and vegetables 3 x research source look for a grill pan with a matching press if you want defined grill marks some grill pans come with matching presses you can use to press the down the food as it cooks to enhance the grill marks you can still get grill marks without a press but they may not be as defined or even get a pan with a lid if you want your food to taste like it was made on a grill when you cook on an actual grill you usually close the grill lid to trap in heat smoke and flavor as the food cooks covering your grill pan with a lid while you re cooking food on it can help create the same effect rinse and dry the pan before you use the pan to cook on quickly rinse it with warm water this will make sure any dust that accumulated on the pan while it was being stored is washed away after rinsing dry the pan with a clean cloth 4 x research source cut your food into relatively thin slices because you re trying to simulate the grilling experience without burning your food you ll need to slice your food relatively thin this way your food will get char marks and a smoky taste but won t burn while you re trying to cook the inside some foods you can prepare using a grill pan include 5 x research source thin hamburgers slices of chicken or steak bacon and eggs vegetable slices like zucchini potatoes carrots peppers or onions brush oil on the food before placing your food on the pan carefully brush oil on your food by brushing oil onto the food instead of the pan you ll make sure the food doesn t stick and the oil doesn t burn on the pan 6 x research source use an oil with a high smoking point like peanut oil canola oil avocado oil or soybean oil avoid using olive oil which has a low smoking point avoid brushing oil on the entire pan as it may burn preheat the pan on medium high allow the pan to heat for at least five minutes by doing this you ll make sure the entire surface of the pan is equally hot this will ensure your food cooks evenly in addition it ll help you get good char grill marks 7 x research source place your food on the pan when the pan has had sufficient time to heat up you ll need to gently place your food in it do so with tongs or other grill equipment allow half an inch 1 25 cm between large items like pieces of chicken or steak lay the food perpendicular to the grill ridges so you get grill marks 8 x research source cover the pan while grill pans seldom come with covers covering the pan may increase the speed with which your food cooks in addition it may enhance the smoky charred flavor to cover your pan carefully place a lid or upside down metal bowl over the food on the grill pan 9 x research source avoid moving food for about one minute once you place the food onto your grill pan you shouldn t flip it or move it for about a minute by leaving it in place you ll help create those sear grill marks that add so much character to your food 10 x research source rotate or move your food after a minute or two if needed if you think your food is burning or cooking unevenly use tongs to rotate the food slightly depending on the food your pan and your stove you may need to experiment to determine how often you need to rotate your food 11 x research source keep in mind that rotating the food will cause the grill marks to be diamond shaped instead of straight lines flip your food once you ve rotated your food and allowed it to sit for several minutes you ll need to flip it flipping it is important so that you cook the food evenly in addition flipping your food will help prevent burning if you re cooking steak that is about 1 inch 2 5 cm thick allow it to sit for 3 5 minutes on one side before moving or flipping it if you re cooking chicken that is about 1 inch 2 5 cm thick allow it to cook for 5 10 minutes on each side let pork cook for 6 7 minutes on one side before flipping it flip burgers after 3 minutes cook bratwurst for 5 minutes before flipping allow shrimp to cook for 2 3 minutes before flipping let vegetables cook for 3 4 minutes on one side before flipping them over if you notice your food charring or burning too much flip it more if it continues to burn turn your heat down 12 x research source take the temperature of your food if you re cooking meat you should take its temperature before you remove it from the pan this way you ll make sure the inside of the meat has risen to minimum temperatures that will guarantee it is safe to eat without taking the temperature you ll simply be guessing about whether the food is done and safe shellfish should be cooked to 145 degrees fahrenheit 63 degrees celsius poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees fahrenheit 74 degrees celsius beef pork veal and lamb should be cooked to 145 degrees fahrenheit 63 degrees celsius ground meat should be cooked to 160 degrees fahrenheit 71 degrees celsius 13 x research source clean the pan with hot water after you ve allowed the pan to cool rinse it thoroughly with hot water then take a clean cloth soak it in hot water and carefully wipe the pan down focus on the grooves in between the ridges to clean them good take your finger cover it with the cloth and wipe along the groove rinse the cloth from time to time after cleaning the grill pan dry it thoroughly with a towel allowing it to air dry will invite rust 14 x research source season the pan if it s cast iron before storing a cast iron grill pan you want to rub a light coat of vegetable oil onto the pan with a paper towel then place the pan on the middle rack of your oven and set your oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit 190 degrees celsius let the pan bake for 1 hour turn the oven off and allow the pan to cool seasoning your pan after each use may increase the effectiveness of your cooking and prolong the life of your pan 15 x research source store the pan in a dry location when storing your cast iron grill pan you ll want to make sure to put it in an area that is dry if you put it in a humid location like in an outside storage area it could wind up rusting as a result try to store it in a pantry or another location that is cool and dry,Food-and-Entertaining
how to fill a propane tank,propane is stored in liquid form in high pressure tanks and it turns into a gas when its pressure is lowered by opening the valve depending on the type of propane tank you have you may be able to fill it on your own when it s empty from a larger supply tank before you fill your propane tank be sure to check that the tank is in good condition and that filling it yourself is legal in your area if you can fill your tank remember to be extremely careful since propane is flammable and could ignite,check that the propane tank has a triangular valve propane tanks cannot be filled unless they have an overfilling protection device or opd look at the top of the propane tank to find the valve used to open it if the valve has a triangular shape or has the letters opd printed on it then it s safe to fill if it doesn t have have a triangular valve then you cannot fill the tank safely 1 x research source some opds were made before they were required to have the letters printed on them check the label or wrapper on your tank if it has a triangular valve but doesn t have opd printed on it look for any damage or dents on the outside of the tank rotate the tank and check for any visual damage such as dents bulges or welds on the surface if the tank has any damage on the outside avoid filling it since it s less stable than a new tank if the tank also has a coat of rust on the outside don t use it or fill it since it could be unsafe 2 x research source cut off the label around the body of the tank and check underneath it for rust or cracks confirm that the date printed on the tank is less than 12 years ago standard propane tanks you would use in a gas grill only last for 12 years before they need to be recertified look around the collar of the tank which is the raised round area surrounding the valve for a listed in mm yy format if the tank is older than 12 years then either replace or have it inspected by a professional propane service otherwise the tank is safe to use 3 x research source if your tank was recertified there may be a second date printed on the collar with the letter e next to it use the most recent date rather than the first one printed get your propane tank recertified 12 years after the first printed date and every 5 years after locate the tare weight and amount of propane the tank holds on the collar the collar of the tank will list the weight of the propane your tank can hold as well as the weight of the empty tank in pounds write down both of the numbers so you know how much propane you should add to your tank when you fill it 4 x research source propane in typically measured by weight rather than volume set the propane tank on a scale to weigh it set a bathroom scale outside and make sure it s zeroed out so you get an accurate reading put your empty propane tank on top of the scale and read the weight compare the weight of the tank to the tare weight to see if there is any difference 5 x research source for example if your tank has a tare weight of 20 pounds 9 1 kg and it weighs 22 pounds 10 0 kg on the scale then it still has 2 pounds 0 91 kg of propane left make sure the scale and tank are on a flat surface so they don t tip over while you re filling connect the empty propane tank to a larger supply tank with a connector hose choose a connector hose that has propane fittings on the end and is long enough to reach between your propane tank and the larger supply tank screw the connector hose counterclockwise onto the port attached to the valve on your empty tank until it s hand tight then use a wrench to tighten the connection so it doesn t leak connect the other end of the hose to the port on the supply tank you re transferring propane from 6 x research source you can buy connector hoses and propane fittings from your local hardware store if you don t have a propane supply tank on your property you may need to go to a propane dealer where they can fill your tank for you if you re filling a 1 pound 0 45 kg propane tank you can buy a connector that attaches to the larger tank open the valves on each of the propane tanks turn the valve on the empty tank counterclockwise to open it and let propane inside then open the valve on the tank you re transferring propane from by turning it counterclockwise you will start to hear the propane hissing through the connector hose once both of the tanks are open 7 x research source cool the tank you re filling with cold water to help the propane transfer if your tanks are the same temperature then the propane won t transfer between them easily turn on a garden hose so a weak stream comes out of the nozzle set the nozzle on top of the tank so the water runs down the sides and cools the tank while it s filling up 8 x research source if you re filling an empty 1 pound 0 45 kg propane tank then you can put it inside a freezer for 30 minutes for you fill it to make it colder close the tank valves when the tank is 80 full since propane expands when it s hot you can only fill it up to 80 full so it doesn t burst when it gets hot calculate 80 of the tank s capacity and add the tare weight to find how much your tank will weigh when it s full when the tank reaches the weight you calculated rotate the valves on both tanks clockwise to close them 9 x research source for example if your tank can hold 20 pounds 9 1 kg of propane and the tare weight is 20 pounds 9 1 kg stop filling the tank once the scale reads 35 36 pounds 16 16 kg open the bleeder valve on the tank you filled to make sure it isn t too full the bleeder valve is a screw underneath the main valve and helps remove any excess propane from your tank put on gloves to protect yourself from any liquid propane if there is any turn the screw counterclockwise with a screwdriver to open the bleeder valve if liquid squirts out of the valve leave it open until there s only vapor if gas or vapor comes out of the valve turn the screw clockwise to seal it again 10 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to bbq with propane,barbecuing with propane is cleaner and more predictable than barbecuing with charcoal and it s an easy to learn process to successfully use propane to grill food you need to get the right supplies and follow a few safety precautions by safely hooking up a propane tank to your gas grill and lighting the grill properly you can start barbecuing your favorite foods in no time,get a propane tank for a gas grill propane tanks are measured by weight if you plan on doing a lot of grilling get a heavier tank with more gas inside if you re only going to be using the tank a few times opt for a smaller propane tank you can find propane tanks at your local supermarket or hardware store place the propane tank next to the grill set it as close to the grill as possible so the grill hose will be able to reach it check to see if the propane tank is off if the knob on the gas tank is turned to the on position turn the knob to the off position for most propane tanks you ll need to turn the knob clockwise to turn the tank off 1 x research source remove the safety cap from the propane tank the safety cap is the plastic cap covering the valve on the top of the tank grab the tab on the safety cap and pull to remove it 2 x research source attach the grill hose to the valve on the propane tank the grill hose is the hose attached to the underside of the grill turn the propane tank so the valve is facing the grill and connect the end of the grill hose to the valve you should feel the end of the hose click into place once the end of the grill hose is attached to the valve turn the knob on the end of the grill hose clockwise to tighten it into place continue turning until the knob won t turn anymore 3 x research source set the propane tank on the grill rack the grill rack is what holds the propane tank underneath the grill check the manual for your grill for specific instructions on how to attach the tank to the rack 4 x research source if the grill doesn t have a grill rack leave the propane tank on the ground next to the grill turn on the propane tank by using the knob on the top of the tank for most propane tanks you ll need to turn the knob counterclockwise until it won t turn anymore to turn the tank on check the arrows on the knob to make sure open the grill lid before lighting it don t ever light the grill with the lid closed or gas buildup could cause an explosion 5 x research source turn the ignition burner knob from off to high you may need to press the knob in before you can turn it to locate the ignition burner knob on the grill look for the knob with a lightning bolt symbol or the word ignition next to it 6 x research source don t worry if the grill doesn t ignite after you turn the knob that just means the grill has an electric starter and you ll need to press the electric ignition button to ignite it press the electric ignition button if the grill has one look for the electric ignition button next to the ignition burner knob press and hold the button until you see flames ignite in the grill it s normal for the button to make a clicking noise as you press it 7 x research source only the section of the grill directly behind the ignition burner knob and electric ignition button should be lit at this point the rest of the grill knobs should still be turned off turn the other grill knobs to the highest setting to preheat the grill turning on the other grill knobs should cause the rest of the grill to ignite 8 x research source close the grill lid and let the grill preheat for 10 15 minutes always let the grill preheat before cooking on it so the food gets cooked all the way through 9 x research source use a wire brush to clean the grates on the grill brush back and forth over each grate getting any dried food or grease to fall off the grate make sure the grill is preheated before you clean it with a brush the heat will make it easier to clean 10 x research source turn the grill knobs down to a lower setting before you put the food on this will prevent the food from burning if you re only barbecuing a small amount of food turn off the grill knobs for the sections of the grill you won t be using if you ll be using the whole grill alternate the grill knobs between medium and low heat so you have different temperatures to cook with 11 x research source place the food you want to grill directly on the grill grates position the food so it s over the flames place foods that need less heat like vegetables on the side of the grill that s set to a lower setting place foods that need higher heat like hamburgers and steaks on the side of the grill that s set to medium or high 12 x research source use a spatula or tongs to occasionally flip the food make sure each side of the food gets equal cook time so it gets cooked evenly through adjust the temperature as needed using the grill knobs remove the food when it s finished and turn off the grill knobs leave the lid of the grill open the propane tank is still on and gas could build up if the lid is closed turn off the propane tank to turn off most propane tanks turn the knob on the top of the tank clockwise until it won t turn anymore look at the arrows on the knob to verify which direction you should be turning it in 13 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to start a gas grill,although gas grills are relatively simple in design if you re inexperienced with grilling you may be at a loss for how to start one many gas grills come with a push button ignition system older or basic models will have to be lit manually should your grill fail to light with its automatic starter or manual lighting techniques troubleshoot your grill by checking lines and valves to resolve the problem,open the lid of your grill keeping your lid closed while lighting can cause gas fumes to build up this can create an exploding hazard if the gas has been turned on with the lid closed turn off the gas and open the lid wait a few minutes for the gas to dissipate then start the process over 1 x research source hook up gas to your grill if necessary in most cases a propane tank is used to supply your grill with gas propane tanks are usually stored beneath behind or to the side of the grill attach the gas line firmly to the propane tank and the gas intake for your grill 2 x research source depending on your grill the hookup for your gas may vary when in doubt follow the usage instructions if you don t have these look up a digital manual with a keyword search for your grill online some grills may be connected by a direct line to the natural gas supplied to your home this kind of gas supply acts the same as a tank but is stationary smaller tabletop grills oftentimes have small canisters of gas which are screwed into the valve of the grill before it can be ignited turn on the gas this is usually done by turning a circular shaped valve on top of the propane tank some grills may have a secondary valve on the grill that you need to open for it to receive gas open the valve fully then wait about a minute for the gas to move through the line to the grill 3 x research source ignite the grill generally this involves turning a regulator knob on the front of your grill for the burner closest to the igniter to its highest setting this will allow gas to flow through the grill up through the grate press the igniter button to cause a spark inside the grill and light the gas follow the ignition instructions for your grill for the best results 4 x research source different grills may have different designs like ones that have the starter and regulator knob combined follow the grill instructions when confused about the ignition procedure once one burner is lit you can light burners next to the lit one without the igniter by simply turning on the regulator knobs for these burners open the lid of your grill and hook up its gas if necessary with the lid closed potentially dangerous explosive gas won t have a chance to build up hook up your gas by attaching the gas line to the gas output like a tank and the input like a connector on the back or side of the grill gas inputs and outputs are usually preceded or followed by a shutoff valve and are frequently shaped like spigots 5 x research source open the valve for the gas supply on the connector that s linking your gas supply to your grill there should be a shutoff valve open this fully to supply gas to your grill wait a few minutes after opening the valve to give the gas enough time to fill the line 6 x research source turn on and ignite the gas place a match in the lighting hole this should be a small hole located on the grill s side open the regulator for the burner closest to the lighting hole fully light the first match already in the lighting hole with a second match the turned on burner should light after your first burner lights it s a simple matter to turn on the regulator knobs for the other burners they should light off the flame already burning in your grill some models of grill may not have lighting holes or might have poorly designed ones in this case stand as far from the grill as you can and use a long stick match to light the grill 7 x research source check the gas supply and supply lines if your tank is empty or your gas supply line is turned off even a perfectly functioning grill won t work replace empty tanks turn all supply valves to the on position once the gas supply and grill are hooked up check supply lines for cracking looseness and other signs of wear and tear replace old or faulty supply lines 8 x research source if the rubber of your supply line feels brittle it s a good sign the line should be replaced replacement parts can be found at most hardware stores and home centers when the grill and gas supply are properly hooked up and the gas turned on a hissing sound especially from connectors or valves could be a sign of a gas leak leaks can result in fire or explosions turn off the gas and stop using your grill immediately if you suspect a leak use a manual method of lighting for faulty starters the starter on your grill is used every time you fire it up the frequent usage of this part sometimes causes it to break or fail when you re certain you have gas and the supply lines are in good condition manual lighting is a great solution for faulty starters 9 x research source sometimes you can tell when an igniter is bad by the sound it makes if you push your igniter and it makes a different sound than normal this could indicate that your igniter no longer works replace burners when necessary if your gas supply is fine and the igniter seems to be working the problem may be with the burners under the grate of your grill follow your grill instructions for proper replacement procedures 10 x research source before replacing your burner try resetting its regulator this may not be possible for all grills but if it is for yours instructions on how to do this will be in the grill s manual you can usually replace burners inexpensively with a suitable new part purchased from a hardware store home center or the manufacturer inspect electrical components if applicable many newer grills have batteries and electrical lines to supply power to other functions of the grill these can come loose or degrade over time re fasten loose electrical cables replace any batteries that might be flat then try to light your grill again igniters in some cases use a small battery to power the ignition mechanism the placement of this part will depend on your grill but many times it is situated close to or underneath the igniter switch 11 x research source allow more time for cold tanks to supply gas to the grill cold weather can cause the internal pressure of tanks to decrease this can cause the gas to flow slower than normal or freeze allow additional time for gas to feed through the supply line to your grill when it is chilly or cold if your tank has frozen you won t be able to use it until it has thawed bring the tank in a warmed location like a shed or basement so it can thaw 12 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to use an electric smoker,using an electric smoker can be a great way to get into smoking your own meats at home unlike traditional charcoal smokers which have to be monitored closely electric smokers make it possible to slow cook meats without checking on them constantly just season the item you re smoking choose your preferred time and temperature settings and let the smoker take care of the rest your meat will be smoked to perfection within a few hours,season your electric smoker if it s your first time using it seasoning an electric smoker involves running it while it s empty to eliminate dust odors and solvent residue left over from the manufacturing process first rub each of the smoker s interior surfaces including the racks with cooking oil any variety will do then turn it on and let it run for 2 3 hours at 250 275 f 121 135 c 1 x research source after seasoning your electric smoker turn it off open the door or hood and allow it to cool off completely before using it or handling any of its components different smokers will have slightly different seasoning procedures some newer models don t need to be seasoned at all be sure to follow the specific instructions outlined in your smoker s user manual 2 x research source you should only have to season your smoker once when it s brand new after that repeated use will help preserve the protective oil layer on the interior surface turn on the smoker hit the power button on the front side of the smoker to activate it this will put your smoker into standby mode it won t actually begin preheating until you ve programmed it to your desired time and temperature settings 3 x research source don t forget to make sure that your smoker is plugged in and that there s nothing obstructing the power cord if it comes unplugged while in operation you ll have wasted not only hours but pounds of good meat add the recommended amount of wood chips to the built in chip tray on most models the chip tray is located on the lower right side of the machine pull out the tray and pack it with your chips of choice once it s full slide it back in and turn the handle counterclockwise to dump the chips onto the internal heating element 4 x research source a good rule of thumb is to use about 4 cups 600 g of chips for every 3 5 hours of smoking you plan on doing this means you may have to replenish the chip tray at regular intervals 5 x research source always use hardwood chips in your smoker such as mesquite apple pecan birch or hickory soft wood like fir and pine burn fast and tend to produce unappetizing flavors 6 x research source preheat the smoker to 200 225 f 93 107 c if your smoker features a digital control panel press the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the temperature as needed for smokers with manual temperature knobs turn the knob until the indicator points to your preferred temperature setting allow up to 30 45 minutes for your smoker to finish preheating 7 x research source for most meats 200 225 f 93 107 c is considered the ideal smoking temperature however the type of meat you re smoking can influence your temperature settings read the guidelines provided with your smoker to learn more about suggested smoking temperatures place a full container of water at the bottom of the smoking chamber once your smoker has finished preheating fill the small metal cup included with your machine with hot water and slide it into its designated slot at the bottom of the smoker if your smoker doesn t have a separate slot for the water cup simply set it on the floor of the chamber the steam created as the water evaporates will keep your meat moist 8 x research source using hot instead of cold or room temperature water helps to ensure that the smoker remains at the optimal temperature be careful putting the water cup inside your smoker as it will be extremely hot if you like you can add apple juice wine or beer or another flavorful liquid to your smoker s water cup to infuse your meats with complex aromatic notes 9 x research source season your meat with a dry rub or marinade to add flavor now that your smoker is ready to go it s time to prepare the items you ll be cooking coat heavier cuts like ribs brisket and pork shoulders with an even layer of dry rub spices for maximum flavor soak more delicate meats such as chicken fish and chops overnight in your favorite acid based marinade 10 x research source you can find dozens of tantalizing homemade dry rub and marinade recipes with a quick internet search 11 x research source while seasoning isn t an essential step it s a simple way to enhance the natural flavor of your meat place your meat directly on the racks inside the smoking chamber use a long handled meat spatula or tongs to transfer the meat to the smoking racks safely arrange the meat according to how the racks are set up situate the biggest items on the wide lower racks and save smaller ones for the upper racks 12 x research source you may need to insert heavy cuts of meat like pork butts or racks of ribs by hand be sure to pull on a thick pair of barbecuing gloves before doing so to protect yourself from burns to prevent the smoke from escaping try to only leave the door open for as short a time as possible 13 x research source close and lock the door of the smoker swing the door shut then flip the latch beside the handle to secure it locking the door will prevent it from swinging open accidentally and letting out heat or smoke 14 x research source always open and close the door on your smoker using the built in handle the metal on the surrounding parts of the door can get extremely hot and may burn you if you re not careful smoke your items for the length of time called for by the recipe this could be 2 8 hours depending on the type of meat you re working with refer to the recipe you re following for a more accurate sense of how long your items will need to smoke in the meantime avoid opening your smoker unless it s to top off the water bowl 15 x research source unlike other cooking methods smoking is all about patience add more wood chips or water as needed while your meat smokes a good way to know whether you need more wood or water is to watch the smoke as soon as it stops open the smoking chamber and refill the water cup to the top then load another 1 4 cups 150 600 g of wood chips into the chip tray slide it back into place and resume smoking 16 x research source keep in mind that just because the chip tray is empty doesn t necessarily mean you should replenish it in fact many barbecue aficionados insist that most meats can be smoked satisfactorily using a single tray 17 x research source over smoking your meat can cause it to come out tasting burnt and unpleasant allow your meat to rest for 15 20 minutes before eating when your items are fully cooked turn off the smoker unlock the door and carefully remove them from the racks set them aside on a separate surface to cool once the meat has reached a safe temperature serve it up and watch it disappear 18 x research source use a meat thermometer to test the internal temperature of your items and see if they re ready to come out if your meat isn t quite done it may need to go back on the smoker for 1 2 hours depending on the recommended internal temperature transfer any leftover portions to an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator they should keep for at least 4 days though they may last much longer if you haven t cut into them yet 19 x research source unplug the smoker and allow it to cool completely before you begin cleaning your electric smoker make sure it s cooled down enough for you to handle its interior components and surfaces safely press the power button to turn the smoker off then remove the electrical cord from the wall outlet to make sure there s no electricity running to it 20 x research source failure to unplug your smoker could put you at risk of burns or electrical shock even if it s turned off to ensure that all of your cooked items come out with the perfect smoked flavor it s recommended that you clean your smoker every time you use it 21 x research source take all removable accessories out of the smoker this includes the smoking racks water cup and chip tray the racks and chip tray should simply slide out while the water cup often sits loose at the bottom of the smoking chamber set these items aside nearby so you can easily replace them when you re done or clean them separately if needed 22 x research source don t forget to empty and rinse out the water cup if there s any water in it that s been used previously use a damp paper towel to brush out any large pieces of debris scrape large food particles and lingering fat residue out the front of the open smoker have a broom and dustpan on standby to sweep up the remnants when you re done 23 x research source if there s a lot of leftover debris your smoker it may be a good idea to stretch out a layer of paper towels in front of your smoker to catch the stuff you brush out afterward you can simply fold it up and toss it in the trash scrub the inside of the smoking chamber thoroughly with soapy water for maximum cleaning power use a kitchen sponge or stiff bristled brush to work the soap solution in deeper and lift away greasy messes make sure you hit the inside of the door as well as all 3 walls and the floor and ceiling 24 x research source if your smoking racks are especially dirty go ahead and give them a quick scrub while you ve got them out you can run the water cup and chip tray through the dishwasher or rinse them under a faucet to wash away a light coating of ash or soot 25 x research source avoid using steel wool or other abrasive cleaning tools these may leave behind scratches on the interior surfaces of your smoker if it s been a while since you last cleaned your smoker and you notice mold growing inside run it empty for 3 4 hours to burn it out before scrubbing it by hand as usual 26 x research source wipe out the smoker using a clean wet cloth once you ve scrubbed out your smoker give it one more quick pass to clear away the soap solution you can also mist it with some clean water in a spray bottle if you don t want to dirty up anything else consider adding a small amount of apple cider vinegar to your spray bottle to cut through any particularly stubborn 27 x research source if you have a smoker with an exposed heating element inside avoid spraying it directly pat the smoker dry with a clean rag or folded paper towel run your rag or paper towel over the entire surface of the smoking chamber to pick up as much standing water as possible then leave the smoker sitting with the door open to give the remaining moisture a chance to evaporate once the interior is dry your smoker will be ready for another round of perfectly slow cooked meats 28 x research source if you re short on time or don t want to go to the trouble of drying the smoker by hand simply open the door and let time take care of the rest keeping the exterior of the smoker clean is as easy as wiping it down with a wet cloth from time to time 29 x research

how to use a charcoal smoker,a charcoal smoker is a great way to cook tender delicious meat that is full of flavor smoking is a little different from grilling in that the goal is to cook the meat with indirect heat the way you set up the charcoal is important as well as adding water to keep the meat moist making adjustments as the meat cooks ensures the temperature of the smoker stays in the sweet spot which is about 220 104 and no higher than 250 121,heat the charcoal in a chimney first a charcoal chimney is a metal cylinder which is used to get charcoal burning before adding it to a grill or smoker visit your local hardware store or look for a chimney online add the charcoal to the chimney and light it let it sit for about 15 minutes 1 x research source the chimney will have its own instructions which you can follow to make sure the charcoal is lit properly if you don t want to invest in a charcoal chimney it s still important to heat the charcoal up in the smoker before you add the meat add the hot charcoal to the smoker on one side of the smoker make a pile of unlit charcoal chunks slowly pour the hot charcoal on top of the unlit charcoal it s important to set the charcoal up on one side of the smoker and then put the meat on the other side 2 x research source arranging your coals on one side and the meat on the other side of the smoker allows the meat to cook with indirect heat and smoke rather than with direct heat other options include setting piles of charcoal on both sides of the smoker and placing the meat in between them or making a circle of charcoal around the outside with meat in the middle enhance the smoke with wood chunks wood chunks and chips are used to give meat greater flavor chunks work better because they smolder for longer oak apple cherry and hickory woods are often used in smokers place the wood in the chimney with the charcoal but set it off to the side of the charcoal when you add it to the smoker 3 x research source other woods can be used but stick to hardwoods softwoods create a sooty smoke and will ruin the flavor of your meat fill the water pan 3 4 full with cold water smokers have a water pan included but grills generally do not use a foil baking pan if you don t have a water pan the water pan sits in the center section of the smoker or on the grate opposite the meat in a grill 4 x research source without the water pan you won t get as much vapor which helps to evenly cook your meat and vegetables cold water is helpful to offset the initially higher temperature of the grill the water helps regulate the temperature down to where you want it for the best smoking place the food on the grate if your smoker has more than one grate put the smaller items and vegetables on the top grate the top grate gets less heat than the lower one distribute the larger pieces of meat on the bottom or lower grate set the lid on the smoker so the vents are positioned above the meat you re creating a flow of air through the smoker so you want the vent to be right over the meat by doing this you set it up so the smoke is pulled through the smoker and it wafts right over the meat before it exits open the bottom and top vents your smoker should have a lower vent which lets air into the chamber and a lid vent which lets the smoker out regulate the temperature with the lower vent depending on the what the smoker needs if the fire is dying open the lower vent more if the temperature is getting too high close it a little 5 x research source generally the top exhaust vent should be left open the whole time only close it if adjusting the bottom vent does not change the temp the way you need it to keep the temperature of the smoker steady the ideal smoker temperature is about 220 104 but don t let it exceed 250 121 you can increase the temperature by adding new coals to the charcoal pile reduce the temperature if necessary by closing the lower vent a little this allows less oxygen to enter the smoker 6 x research source if your smoker doesn t have a temperature gauge stick the probe of an oven thermometer through a hole in the lid vent leave the lid on the smoker every time you take the lid off smoke and heat escape the best meat comes from a smoker with an even consistent temperature only take the lid off if you need to add charcoal or add water to the water pan 7 x research source it s okay to check on the meat to see how it is cooking and make sure there s enough coals but only do this once an hour or so smoking is a slow and steady process smoking is a fairly hands off process so rest assured that the meat is cooking without you checking it all the time keep a second set of live coals going and add them as necessary if the temperature inside the smoker is starting to cool and adjusting the lower vent doesn t help add more coals it is helpful to keep an extra set of coals hot in the chimney in case you need to add them to the smoker 8 x research source this works better than adding unlit charcoal on top of the spent coals if you don t have a chimney use a foil baking pan to keep some extra coals hot cook most meats for about 4 hours at 220 f 104 c smoking is not an exact science the amount of meat you re cooking the type of meat and other factors affect the time it will take to get the perfect cook longer times at lower temperatures generally makes the meat more tender 9 x research source there is a point where you ve smoked meat for too long if it cooks so long that it becomes tough all the way through you ll realize you ve cooked it for too long smoke seasoned barbecue pork chops rub some pork chops with salt black pepper brown sugar thyme onion powder and cayenne let them soak in the spices for a few hours then with your smoker heated to about 275

how to use a charcoal grill,grilling is a fun tasty way to prepare a meal year round charcoal grills aren t as easy to use as gas grills but they give food even more flavor make things easier by starting with a charcoal chimney then lay your prepared coals in your grill quick cooking foods like hot dogs hamburgers and many vegetables can be cooked over an open grill if you re working with slower cooking foods like bone in chicken or roasts cover them up and check on them from time to time,lay briquettes in a charcoal chimney about 3 pounds 1 4 kg will be enough to fill most chimneys and for most grills your chimney may also have a fill line if so use that as a guide 1 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source a charcoal chimney is basically a metal cylinder with a grate at the bottom holes in the side and a handle on the side you place the charcoal inside light it efficiently and safely then pour the briquettes in your grill when they re ready lighter fluid can be dangerous and is not necessary if you use a charcoal chimney prepare your fire starter take a piece of newspaper and wad it up dip it in vegetable oil and place it in the bottom of the chimney underneath its grate light the chimney rest it on a flat fire safe surface like a concrete driveway or the grill grate take a long match or igniter and stick it in one of the holes on the side to light the newspaper let the flames travel up the coals and burn until they re ashed over this should take about 20 minutes 2 x research source keep an eye on the chimney as you wait lay an even layer of charcoal for fast cooking foods lift up the grill grate and gently dump the coals into the grill foods like hot dogs hamburgers and vegetables cook quickly and will need a layer of coals spread evenly throughout the grill 3 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source create two zones of heat for slower cooking foods alternatively bone in chicken roasts pork loin and similar foods take a longer time to cook dump the coals in your grill then move them to one side this will create a zone of indirect heat so the foods will cook thoroughly without burning 4 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source clean your grill grate take a clean rag and wrap it tightly around one end of a stick spatula or long metal spoon so that it forms a ball dip it in water then run it back and forth over the now hot grill grate to remove any grease old food or other debris keep dipping the stick in water if necessary to keep it wet 5 x research source some people recommend cleaning your grill with a stiff wire brush before heating it however this can potentially cause small metal particles to end up in your food cleaning with a wet rag is safe and debris will come off of the grill grate more easily now that the coals have heated it add wood chips for extra smoke flavor dump 1 or 2 handfuls of wood chips on the coals just before you add your food this will give your food the most contact time with the smoke helping it get the rich flavor you want 6 x research source use only food grade wood chips you can find these wherever grilling supplies are sold hickory mesquite and applewood are popular varieties of wood chips for grilling soaking the wood chips in plain water for 20 minutes before grilling helps them burn slower increasing the flavor they give your food place your food on the grill when it is hot waiting a minute before placing your food on the grill grate ensures a good sear and keeps things from sticking place quick cooking foods directly over the coals foods that take longer to cook should be placed to the side of the coals so they can receive indirect heat 7 x research source brush a little oil on your grill surface before you place the food on it this will also help prevent sticking cover the grill if necessary hot dogs hamburgers and other quick cooking foods can be grilled with the lid off if you have slower cooking foods like bone in chicken or pork loin place the lid on the grill this increases the amount of indirect heat helping the foods to cook thoroughly 8 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source add new coals every 30 60 minutes if you have any foods that take a long time to cook don t open the lid too often to check on your food since this will cause heat to escape adjust the grill s dampers to control the heat open the dampers if you want to increase the heat such as to sear a steak close them if you want to cook something at a lower temperature such as to roast a pork loin or vegetables 9 x research source opening the dampers makes the coals burn hotter since they receive more oxygen closing them has the opposite effect check the temperature of your food use an instant read digital thermometer to check the internal temperature of your food take the food off the grill only when it reaches the right temperature

how to add smoke to a gas grill,part of what makes cooking on a charcoal grill distinctive is the smoky flavor that the coals impart to the food a gas grill is much easier to use but it doesn t allow for the natural smoky flavors of charcoal grilling luckily adding a smoky flavor to food cooked on a gas grill is very easy you can build a homemade smoker box suitable for any gas grill in only a few minutes,practice using your grill before making any modification to your gas grill be sure you re comfortable using it you should know how hot it gets if it heats unevenly and where your fire extinguisher is stored if you re new to grilling try a few practice runs with small quick meals like salmon before moving on to smoking put your grill in an open area if you usually grill in a covered area like under a gazebo or shade sail move it out into the open before trying smoking smoke can discolor cloth and wood and can make it difficult to breathe in an enclosed area 1 x research source choose wood chips for flavor you can buy wood chips at any store that sells barbecue supplies your local grocery store may even have them different woods impart different smoke flavors so be sure to match your wood choice with the kind of food you want to cook 2 x research source oak and hickory are suitable for anything and are great starter woods if you re new to smoking use apple for fish and vegetables if you re cooking poultry try apple pecan or cherry mesquite is a very strong wood and is best for tough larger cuts like beef brisket you can buy larger wood chunks if you re smoking a very large piece of meat the process is still the same check to make sure your wood chips are food grade always buy food grade wood chips don t use scrap wood or construction grade wood it s treated with chemicals that can poison you or make your food taste bad 3 x research source buy a foil baking pan buy a disposable foil baking pan at your local grocery store this will be the base for your smoker box the size of the foil pan depends on the size of your grill but in general the baking pan should be less than one quarter the size of your entire grill surface 4 x research source if your grill is small you can fold the pan in half or simply fold over heavy duty aluminum foil to make a packet measure out your wood chips for most grills 1 cup 240 ml of wood chips per smoker box will be fine you ll need 1 cup 240 ml for every half hour of smoking you plan to do so if you want to smoke something for several hours prepare additional packets while the first set is smoking 5 x research source soak your wood chips in water for an hour put your wood chips in a bowl of water and let them soak for an hour this lets them get wet enough to produce lots of smoke you can also soak them in wine whiskey or juice instead for a more flavorful effect 6 x research source you can smoke with dry wood but it s much easier to get a flavorful effect with damp wood put the wood chips in the pan drain the wood chips and put them in the foil pan if you re planning to use multiple sets of chips during cooking keep the bowl of water handy for when you re ready to prep the next set 7 x research source cover the pan with heavy duty foil make sure the top of your pan is sealed with aluminum foil if you are making the entire smoker box out of foil make sure all the edges are folded over securely 8 x research source pierce a few small holes in the pan use a knife or a fork to pierce a few holes in the top of the pan about one hole every 2 inches 5 1 cm will be fine but it s okay to have more be careful not to tear the foil you don t want the wood chips to spill out in your grill 9 x research source put the smoker box on one corner of the cooking grate if one part of the grill cooks hotter than the rest of it put the box there if not any corner is fine 10 x research source you can also put the smoker box under the grate but it is much harder to replace it during cooking preheat your grill turn your grill to the temperature your recipe calls for and wait until it s thoroughly heated you can close the grill to gather as much smoke as possible but you don t have to close it yet 11 x research source wait until the wood begins to smoke wet chips will give off steam before they start really smoking so be sure the wood is actually smoking before you start cooking steam is white odorless and rises quickly smoke is darker has a smell and rises more slowly 12 x research source add your food to the grill avoid letting your food actually touch the smoker box if it s touching the box it might not cook evenly all over space out your food evenly on the grill to let it get the full smoky effect 13 x research source you can try putting the food on an unlit burner and letting the heat from the rest of the grill smoke it but this isn t a requirement close your grill keep the grill closed for as long as possible it s okay if you need to turn the food or baste it but resist the temptation to open the grill to check for smoke every time you open it the smoke will get out cook according to the recipe cook your food for as long as your recipe calls for this will depend on what you re cooking but in general fish and small cuts of boneless meat will cook much more quickly than large cuts or bone in meat 14 x research source replace the wood chips every half hour if you re going to be cooking for more than half an hour you ll need to replace the wood chips you can prepare a second smoker box in advance and simply switch it out or you can remove the box from the grill and add new wet chips before returning it 15 x research source be very careful removing and replacing the foil remove the food from the grill when your food is cooked pull it off the grill remove any food debris on the cooking grate and let your meat sit for a few minutes before cutting and serving take the smoker box off the grill after it s cooled turn the grill off and let it cool completely you can reuse the smoker box so don t throw it out when you remove the smoker box avoid touching the wood chips they might still be hot wood chips are a fire hazard so be very careful disposing of them soak them in water and put them in a metal container before throwing them out 16 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to control the temperature of a smoker,smokers are a great way to cook your food to perfection it can take a while before your meal is ready to eat but the results are well worth it the dampers are the primary way to control the temperature but you also have to consider other factors too such as wind fuel and outdoor temperatures once you understand how these affect the smoker you can become a master at smoking meat,locate the intake damper the intake damper is located at the bottom of the smoker where the fuel is it controls how much oxygen reaches the fire you can open and close it however much is necessary 1 x research source locate the exhaust damper the exhaust damper is located near the top of the smoker it helps pull the oxygen through the fire it also allows the gases heat and smoke to leave the smoker you should always leave the exhaust damper open least partway in order to maintain airflow 2 x research source open the intake damper all the way to generate high heat this setting may vary from recipe to recipe but in general it lays between 450 and 550 f 232 and 288 c in order to get the smoker this hot you need to open the intake damper all the way to allow the most oxygen in 3 x research source open the damper a quarter or halfway to get low or medium heat the more you close the intake damper the cooler the smoker will become to get a medium heat range of 350 to 450 f 177 to 232 c leave the intake damper open halfway to get a low heat range of 250 to 350 f 121 to 177 c leave the intake damper open a quarter of the way 4 x research source open the damper up to a quarter of the way to get a low slow smoke some recipes call for a low heat or a slow smoke this usually converts to 225 to 275 f 107 to 135 c in order to get the smoker this cool you should leave the intake damper open an eighth to a quarter of the way 5 x research source adjust the exhaust damper if adjusting the intake damper doesn t help if the bottom vent is closed all the way and the temperature is still too hot try closing the top vent a little not all the way you can also try removing some fuel with metal tongs never dose coals inside the smoker with water on the other hand if the smoker is running too cool you can try opening the exhaust vent more 6 x research source still having trouble increasing airflow prop the lid open a little keep the water pan full to maintain temperature the water will help absorb the heat and regulate the temperature depending on the size of the pan your smoker and the temperature expect to refill it every 3 to 4 hours in most cases you ll want to use hot water but if the smoker is getting too hot switch to cold water 7 x research source the water pan should be in the middle of the cooking section right under the bottommost cooking grate 8 x research source don t peak much like using an oven you should not peak at your food each time you open the lid you will increase the airflow and temperature the only time you should open the cooker is to turn the meat check the fuel or add water 9 x research source be careful not to overshoot your target temperature it can take a long time before the temperature on the smoker starts to rise once the temperature starts to rise however it can shoot up pretty quickly be extra vigilant during this time and make minor adjustments before the temperature reaches the target 10 x research source it is easy to overshoot your target temperature but difficult to go back down to it if the temperature is rising too fast close the damper a little the temperature will still rise just at a slower rate give your smoker time to adjust to the new settings any adjustments that you make to the intake damper or fuel won t happen immediately give it a couple minutes or hours before you try something new 11 x research source be aware that the temperature will fluctuate naturally as the food cooks meat will absorb more heat during earlier stages of cooking resulting in slower temperature rises as the meat cooks it will absorb less heat resulting in faster temperature rises 12 x research source the temperature may spike as your fuel breaks down it should climb back down after about 15 to 30 minutes perform a dry run the first time you use the smoker a dry run is where you run your smoker without any food this will help you gauge how long it takes your smoker to reach a certain temperature write down how long it takes for your smoker to reach the right temperature keep this for future reference 13 x research source use a lid thermometer to keep track of the temperatures inside the smoker some smokers have built in thermometers but these can be off by 50 f 10 c make sure that the thermometer is away from the edge of the grate some parts of a smoker are much hotter than others if you place your thermometer near these areas you won t get an accurate temperature reading 14 x research source some thermometers especially electric ones are just inaccurate or go bad you should replace it when this happens search for leaks if the temperature is inaccurate if the temperature inside the smoker does not match the temperature on the damper you may have a leak this is especially common among cheap barrel shaped smokers the leaks typically occur around seams once you find them seal them with gaskets or food safe silicone 15 x research source if sealing leaks did not help try using the exhaust damper instead of the bottom ones to adjust the temperature ensure that the smoker is clean if the inside of the bowl or ash catcher are dirty you will have poor airflow which can affect the temperature the bottom damper should also be clean to reduce clogs if it is clogged then you won t have enough oxygen reaching your fire resulting in low temperatures 16 x research source if your smoker tends to run too hot leave it smoky and greasy inside this will make it less reflective and allow it to radiate heat outside the smoker 17 x research source adjust the intake damper on hot cold or windy days if it is a hot or windy day close the intake damper to reduce the temperature inside the smoker if it is a cold day open the damper in increase the temperature if that doesn t help try the following 18 x research source hot day move the smoker out of sunlight or shield it with a canopy or patio umbrella cold day have extra fuel handy windy day work downwind or move the smoker next to a wall to shield it check the fuel if the temperature is not rising fast enough if your intake damper is open and the temperature has not changed for several hours give the charcoal or firewood a stir if that doesn t help add some more charcoal or firewood 19 x research source switch up the brand of fuel sometimes that is all that you need to do not all brands are created equal 20 x research source lump charcoal tends to burn hotter and faster than coal briquettes 21 x research source if the smoke is white the wood may not be burning properly open the intake damper to allow more oxygen and create a hotter fire,Food-and-Entertaining
how to use a smoker,a smoker cooks meat on a low heat using plant pulp fuel and smoke such as charcoal or wood chips it will impart a rich flavor and tenderize the meat over 4 to 12 hours of continuous contact with mild heat and strong smoke read more to learn how to use a smoker to cook meat,acquire your smoker electric charcoal gas and water are popular types of smokers that are used with everything from jerky to turkeys electric and gas smokers will generally cook meat slightly faster than the other types assemble your smoker if you have just purchased it pay careful attention to the fire box and the air vents these are essential parts of the smoker which can result in fire or ruined meat if broken cure your smoker before you use it to cook 1 x research source you will need to start a fire in the fire box get it up to a temperature of 400 degrees fahrenheit 204 degrees celsius and then turn it down to 225 107 degrees celsius to smoke for several hours you will remove contaminants and have a layer of seasoning in the smoker buy your wood chips or charcoal wood chips are generally used with a smoker to create the smoke flavor and they come in varieties like oak alder cherry hickory and apple 2 x research source make sure the wood you choose is free of any chemicals this is true of charcoal smoking as well since the fumes from the chemicals will go directly on your meat it is a good idea to begin with pre soaked chips instead of making your own find a safe place to put your smoker outdoors where it will not be a fire or health risk you will want it to be outside away from strong winds find a dry rub or marinade recipe for your smoked meat mix it up a day before you plan to smoke apply the rub or marinade to your meat 3 x research source place the meat in a plastic or glass container store it in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 1 day 4 x research source fill your smoker with fuel this can be charcoal a propane gas tank or simply the electrical plug insert the wood chips if you are using them make sure that you have more nearby to restock the smoking chamber if you are using a gas smoker you will want to place the chips inside a foil packet poke holes in the top of the packet 6 or more times place the packet very close to the heat so that it will produce smoke 5 x research source if you are using a water smoker you can place fresh herbs in the water to give the meat extra flavor start your fire you will need to ensure air can get around the wood or charcoal so open up the air vents wide then let it heat for at least 20 to 30 minutes while your fire will reach high temperatures of 400 degrees at the beginning you will want it to cool down to a lower temperature after 30 minutes turn the air vents nearly closed to discourage fire and encourage smoldering coals or wood aim for a temperature between 180 and 275 degrees fahrenheit 82 to 135 degrees celsius the temperature should be adjusted according to the type of smoker the type of meat and the size of the meat pieces 6 x research source for example fish should be smoked at a lower heat than beef a large pork shoulder can use a higher heat than small pieces of beef jerky electric and gas smokers tend to cook hotter so turn the heat down to a lower setting insert the meat on a rack or on multiple smoking racks check on the meat only 1 to 2 times per smoking session you will need to check on the fuel and wood chips to replace them remember that each time you open the smoker you will let heat escape smoke approximately 1 to 1 5 hours for each lb 0 45kg of meat 7 x research source if you believe your smoker cooks at a hotter temperature you will want to aim for 1 hour per lb you can also cook longer at a lower temperature rotate the meat every 2 to 3 hours mop some marinade on the meat each time before you turn it check on the meat at least 1 hour before it is scheduled to be done it is better to under cook than overcook because you can always reinsert the meat into the smoker and cook it more overcooking is common with small off set home smokers remove the meat when you have checked it and it looks done remember that some woods can give meat a redder color so it will be harder to tell when it is cooked,Food-and-Entertaining
how to buy propane,propane is a high energy alternative to traditional fossil fuels that is known for its low emissions due to minimal carbon levels it can be used to power everything from portable stoves and barbeques to home heating appliances and backup electric generators regardless of what you re using it for you ll either be renting a tank or purchasing one and knowing how to determine the right path will give you the best fuel for your money,determine what your propane tank is for whether you purchase a propane tank or lease one the best way to start narrowing down your choices is by asking yourself what you need propane for it can be used for drying clothes heating your home and cooking among other things make a list of all the things you do that are going to use propane for and then determine the range of propane usage you need 1 x research source choose a 4 7 gallon 18 l tank for barbeque grills if you re barbecuing the smaller portable tanks that you can purchase or exchange at local hardware big box and grocery stores are best anything more and you should consider a bigger tank gas stations also typically supply small propane tanks select a 500 gallon 1 900 l or 1 500 gallon 5 700 l tank for families the average family that uses propane to heat their home uses around 1 200 gallons 4 500 l each year this means a 500 gallon 1 900 l tank will need to be refilled about 3 times a year and a 1 500 gallon 5 700 l tank about 1 time per year families that also want to use propane appliances such as dryers hot water heaters and stoves use around 1 500 gallons 5 700 l each year so similar tank sizes are suitable determine your tank size based on location and propane needs most residential tanks located above ground are 120 gallons 450 l 250 gallons 950 l 500 gallons 1 900 l or 1 000 gallons 3 800 l underground tanks are typically either 500 gallons 1 900 l or 1 000 gallons 3 800 l always compare the amount of space you have in your yard with the available tank sizes so you know you have enough space to accommodate your propane 2 x research source 250 gallons 950 l tanks are 7 5 inches 19 cm in length and 30 inches 76 cm in diameter 320 gallon 1 200 l tanks are 10 inches 25 cm in length and 30 inches 76 cm in diameter 500 gallon 1 900 l tanks are 10 inches 25 cm long and 37 inches 94 cm in diameter and 1 000 gallon 3 800 l gallon tanks are 16 inches 41 cm long and 41 inches 100 cm in diameter choose a price range that suits your budget propane tanks can run anywhere from 500 to over 2000 that s a pretty big price range so decide on your limit and look for tanks that are going to offer you the size you need and nothing more to avoid spending too much money 3 x research source 1 000 gallon 3 800 l tanks are the most expensive and are around 2 699 new and 1 899 used 500 gallon 1 900 l tanks are around 1 699 new and 799 used anything less than 1 000 is going to be 500 gallons 1 900 l or less for example 500 gallon 1 900 l tanks are 799 used 320 gallon 1 200 l tanks are 699 used 250 gallon 950 l tanks are 599 used and 120 gallon 450 l vertical tanks are around 549 used start scouting for potential locations for your tank propane tanks need to be close to all weather roads so that the delivery truck hoses typically between 100 to 150 feet 30 to 46 m can reach them in bad weather professional installation is recommended although if you have the motivation you can dig your own hole 4 x research source for a 500 gallon 1 900 l tank the typical hole size is around 5 feet 1 5 m in depth and width with a length of around 12 feet 3 7 m if you invest in professional installation be sure to take notes and pictures of the installation and keep them recorded this information comes in handy when switching tanks or providers most regions have certain requirements that determine how and where propane installation can take place you ll probably have to visit a local fire department for permits some regions require an additional plumbing permit which you can get from local planning departments all permits are around 25 to 50 and typically don t have to be renewed purchase a used propane tank on classified sites for the lowest price you can find used 500 gallon 1 900 l propane tanks on sites like craigslist for between 375 to 625 which equates to around 0 75 to 1 5 per 1 gallon 3 8 l these prices can vary depending on your area contact propane dealers and ask them about the requirements and costs for certifying and testing used tanks 5 x research source never purchase a tank with a missing or unreadable manufacturer s plate always make sure it has the u asme stamp and ask if cylinders are in good condition and up to date 6 x research source some of the popular manufacturers that you can buy tanks from are trinity industries and american welding and tank national dealers like ferrellgas suburban propane and amerigas both sell and lease tanks contact the national propane gas association for propane retailer referrals in your area by providing them with your zip code buy a propane tank new from a manufacturer for higher quality contact the national propane gas association and give them your zip code for referrals to propane retailers in your area shop and compare all of the prices from different suppliers you don t get this kind of freedom when leasing so take advantage of it 7 x research source choose your preferred color or even paint the tank yourself keep in mind that liability is on you when you own a tank this includes propane leaks and any problems that result from undetected repairs maintain your tank and invest in repairs from local hardware stores or manufacturers refer to your appliance service manual for recommended maintenance frequency buy exchange or refill a small propane tank for barbecuing if you need a smaller propane tank suitable for a barbeque head to a local hardware grocery or big box store you can purchase tanks exchange an existing tank for a new full one or pay for a refill 8 x research source exchanges are typically more 20 pound 9 1 kg tanks hold around 4 7 gallons 18 l of propane which means you re paying about 18 47 at a price of 3 93 per gallon avoid locations that charge by the tank as you re essentially paying more since the price is the same even if a bit of propane is left in it also make sure the store is filling your tank all the way some fill tanks to just 15 pounds 6 8 kg to save money fewer hardware stores offer refills and hours are sometimes limited call around first and make sure that a trained employee is on site so you don t have to wait or waste time showing up when no one can service you purchase propane from legal suppliers if you re leasing always refer back to the contract prior to purchasing propane most homeowners are required to purchase propane strictly from the company that owns the tank this requirement typically last for 3 to 5 years but check your contract to be sure 9 x research source remember many of these suppliers will tack on extra charges that can add up to about 120 per year or 1 200 or more over a period of 10 years in most states it s illegal for propane companies to fill tanks that are leased from other companies many states will fine as much as 10 000 to propane dealers that fill tanks belonging to other companies but if you lie about owning a leased tank you are legally responsible for paying this fine leased tanks typically come with the benefit of the company covering all repair and maintenance expenses the end of the contract gives you the chance to switch to another supplier if choose to go this route you ll need to have your old tank removed to make room for the installation of a new one call a local propane supplier for propane pricing prior to delivery look into the local propane suppliers in your area these companies offer residential industrial and commercial propane services methods of payment vary based on suppliers so always ask about the available options try and use a company with fixed prices so that your propane costs will be consistent whenever you purchase it always ask about minimum monthly purchasing requirements and propane delivery fees these fees typically vary depending on the volume of propane fuel gas stations and department stores like costco are other common places you can purchase propane arrange for propane delivery to your home after deciding on the product most companies offer two kinds of delivery automatic and as needed automatic refers to scheduled deliveries that are based on your estimated propane usage to ensure that your tank is always full as needed deliveries let you monitor your propane usage on your own and call for a delivery when you need one automatic delivery works best for high volume users and people who don t have the time to monitor their propane usage on their own,Food-and-Entertaining
how to hook up a small propane tank to a grill,if you need to hook up a small propane tank to your grill whether it be replacing the old one or you got a new grill this article will come in handy please consult step 1 to find out how to begin hooking up a small propane tank to a grill,get your grill safely set up make sure that your grill is safely positioned far away from any flammable material and that the grill cover is completely open never attach propane to the grill with the grill cover closed if the propane is accidentally turned on with the grill cover down it could accumulate under the cover and explode in a fireball causing serious harm 1 x research source make sure the gas is turned to the off position before hooking the propane tank up to the grill remove the empty tank from the grill if you haven t already the grill is now ready for your safe set up remove the plastic cap covering the propane nozzle the plastic cap will be perforated making for relatively easy removal and should boast a bright color like red or blue 2 x research source connect the grill s gas line to the propane tank nozzle the propane tank should fit snugly into the gas line 3 x research source start fastening the coupler by turning it to the right make sure the coupler is fully screwed in but not so tight that you won t be able to unscrew the coupler when the time comes to put in a new tank 4 x research source consult your grill s manufacturer s manual as an extra resource it may contain useful information on the amount of propane you want flowing out of the valve as well as answer any troubleshooting questions you may have during the setup process turn the gas valve on the propane tank to the open position your valve should be in the shape of a triangle and etched with the words opd or overfill protection device 5 x research source make sure the gas line is in and secure 6 x research source once that is done you are ready to turn the grill on again and enjoy a finger lickin season of bbq,Food-and-Entertaining
how to measure the remaining propane,the only accurate way to measure the propane left in a propane tank is to weigh it the following are the steps needed to find the amount of propane left in a propane tank and to approximate the length of time it will take to burn the propane in a given appliance,engraved on the side of the tank should be the letters tw then a number this number is the empty tank weight for example the typical 5 gallon 18 9 l propane tank might say tw 17 2 the weight of the empty tank in the example is 17 2 lbs weigh the tank on a bathroom scale to find the total current weight let s say that the current weight of the tank is 24 2 lbs 1 x research source subtract the tank weight from the total weight to find the weight of the propane 24 2 lbs 17 2 lbs 7 lbs 2 x research source each pound of propane contains 21 600 btus 3 x research source multiply the number of pounds by the number of btus contained in each to get the total number of btus remaining in the tank 7 21 600 151 000 btus find the btu output of the appliance in question these can often be found on manufacturers web sites for example a propane grill may burn 12 000 btus an hour to find the remaining running time for the grill divide 151 000 by 12 000 151 000 12 000 12 6 hours of run time for easy future reference divide 12 6 hours by the aforementioned 7 lbs to get 1 8 hours of grill run time per pound of bathroom scale measured propane,Food-and-Entertaining
how to build a bbq pit,building your own barbecue pit can be as simple or as complicated as you like if you love to barbecue what s better than having your own custom made pit in your backyard it s more authentic than one that you wheel out every now and then and it can double up as a smoker you can make your own backyard pit for relatively little money time and labour but you will get out what you put in be sure to take safety seriously plan what you are going to do and take some time with the construction and you could be enjoying barbecuing in your own pit this summer,decide on a good location it s important to have a great location for your bbq pit you don t want it too far away from your house so you have to carry all the food and utensils too far but you don t want to put it somewhere where the smoke will blow straight into your or your neighbour s house 1 x research source more important than convenience elements however are the safety factors which you should bear in mind be sure you place it away from overhanging trees buildings and fences which could be damaged by the smoke or catch fire 2 x research source if you are building it on the surface it should be placed on level ground 3 x research source decide what kind of pit to go for there are a huge variety of potential barbeque pits and you can even be creative in your design find one you like and you have the right space for check you can afford all the materials and you have the time to work on it there s nothing worse than leaving something half finished rope in a few friends or family members to help especially if they are quite good with their hands you can pay them back with grilled meat draw out your plan barbecue pit plans vary from the very simple to the very complicated and ornate if you are building it from scratch you can find some plans to follow on the internet if you are not so experienced in building it might be a good idea to start off with a relatively simple plan you can lay it out on the ground to get a clear picture of the size and shape 4 x research source a rectangular shape with sides that reach up to around waist height is fine you can add more elements such as a cooling rack or a smoker get your tools for this most simple of barbecue pit options you need little few tools but before you start be sure to have gathered up a shovel some bricks or cinderblocks optional mortar a grill a spirit level and something that you can use to cover the pit when you are not using it you can also use some gravel sand paving slabs or excess bricks dig a hole the depth of one brick turned vertically the first step to making a basic barbecue pit is digging a hole not larger than you can cover with your grill at an appropriate and safe place in your backyard a basic pit could be the depth of one brick or cinderblock whichever you are using turned vertically you can make it bigger or smaller depending on your requirements and you can use it as a smoker too 5 x research source a rectangle or square is the easiest shape to use use bricks or cinderblocks to secure the sides once you have the hole knock in the bricks around the edges to give it a solid structure it s best to use some mortar to fix it in place and be sure that the bricks will not become dislodged and fall into the hole you can look at some pictures online to see how it ought to look you could even make a pit without putting bricks along the sides but this is a good idea to make it more secure and lasting check it is level lay a spirit level over the top of the pit to check that it is level if it is too large for your spirit level you can place a longer plank of wood over it the hole and put the spirit level on top of that try laying your grill over the top of the pit to check that it sits on it nicely and does not slide off to one side use slabs and gravel for optional extra touches you can place some slabs around the edges of the pit on the grass to give you an area to place your grill and clearly demarcate the area where the barbecue is this is an excellent way to make it more of a feature and you can be creative with how you lay out it the fire shouldn t come in contact with any grass a wildfire is the last thing you want when having a barbecue if you don t do this you should clear away the grass from the edges of the pit for safety reasons you can spread some gravel or masonry sand in the base of the pit to so you are not burning wood directly on the soil 6 x research source set up the grill the gridiron is now ready to be added to your project now that you have your formation set up you can lay your grill across the hole you can add some bricks or cinder blocks around the edges to hold it in place more securely get your tools and equipment to make an above ground pit that you can take down again with little fuss all you really need are some bricks or cinderblocks and your grill a steel sheet will be necessary if you are building it up fairly high above the ground this is a job that is very easy to quick to do but you still need to take care with the construction and follow the safety precautions as you would with a more complex barbecue pit as always how many cinder blocks or bricks you need will depend on the size of the pit you want to construct preparing the site once you have chosen a safe place to put it you need to do a bit of work preparing the ground the main job is to clear the space and make sure that the ground is level and flat if it isn t level you will end up with a wonky grill which could end in disaster 7 x research source build up your layers now lay out the bricks or cinderblocks according to the size you want and the plan you have drawn up be sure to measure everything carefully and check the stability of it all as you go if it doesn t seem stable you need to step back and have a rethink this will most likely be because the ground isn t sufficiently level for the blocks to sit easily on it you can build them up in a simple regular sided shape or try a circle this might require you to cut the blocks which will require more tools like a chisel and hammer add an optional shelf if you building it up quite high you don t want the coals to be too far away from the grill think about how low you drop the grill down over the coals when you use a regular stand alone barbecue a good way to take account of this is to add a steel shelf two bricks below where you will be putting the grill 8 x research source add the extra layers of brick and secure the grill once you have installed the shelf build up two more layers on the same pattern you have been using you can just lay the grill on top of your top layer but you could add another layer of bricks around the edges to help keep it in place get a plan you are confident with if you decide to build a serious brick barbecue pit you will need some good plans and plenty of time and material you will need to use mortar to fix the bricks or blocks you use so be sure you are comfortable taking this on once you build a fixed aboveground barbecue pit it s not so easy to knock it down again get together everything you need these pits require quite a lot more equipment expense and technical skills to construct you will a shovel mortar mix cement mix bricks or cinderblocks a fire tray depending on the height of your barbecue a grill as well as a spirit level water and hand tamps you will also need metal braces to attach you grill to the bricks 9 x research source lay out the foundations a big brick barbecue is a heavy thing that needs good foundations to support it it is possible to use a base of stone and sand like the more simple versions but it is recommended that for a large fixed pit you prepare you solid foundations to do this you will need to dig down around four inches inside the area where you are building the barbecue and pour in concrete 10 x research source you will need to leave for around 48 hours to set it s also a good idea to have a slight slope so rainwater will run off the concrete rather than collecting on top of it 11 x research source build up the bricks when the foundations are set you need to start building up the bricks around the sides using the mortar trowel and hand tamper take time over this and keep it nice and neat mortar dries relatively quickly so be sure to have all your bricks or cinderblocks to hand before you start put bricks in the corners first and work out from there removing the excess mortar that is squeezed out from between bricks as you go 12 x research source fill any gaps with excess mortar each new layer of bricks should begin with a layer of mortar on top of the previous layer on bricks which the new bricks are placed onto be sure to look at a brick laying tutorial first if you haven t done this before attach the metal braces for the grill once you have got your bricks up to the height you want add one more layer of mortar and affix the metal braces at the appropriate places on the top layer of bricks 13 x research source this should set fairly quickly but don t walk off and leave it once it is set attach the grill across the top

how to light a grill,grilling is one of the quintessential ways to cook food in the summer grilling outdoors can let you achieve high heat and impart a smoky flavor that is difficult to replicate while cooking indoors whether you use a charcoal grill or a gas grill you will need to know how to get your grill ready for cooking,practice fire safety whenever working with open flames it s important to take precautions keep a fire extinguisher nearby when you re grilling if you re using a propane grill check for any leaks and ensure that any tubes and fittings are secure 1 x research source gather your tools whatever kind of grill you have there are a few essential tools you ll need to get your grill started 2 x research source tongs you ll need these to spread the coal around long matches or a grill lighter if you don t have long matches you can light a piece of paper with a small match and use it to light the coals oven mitts clean the grill remove all ash and grease from your grill scrubbing with a grill brush to remove any burnt on fats wipe down the cleaned grate with cooking oil if you re working with a gas grill heat it up before cleaning then use a grill brush to scrape off the loosened food and debris cooking with a dirty grill can impart unpleasant flavors to your food if you don t have a grill brush any metal bristled brush will work open the vents if you re using a charcoal grill charcoal grills have vents on the bottom of the grill these vents allow air to enter the grill and stoke the fire opening the vents will make it easier to light the charcoal the vent will usually be a circular disk on the bottom of the grill that you can twist to open the air holes pour the charcoal into the grill the amount of charcoal will vary based on the size of your grill but a good rule of thumb to follow is to add enough to form two layers on the bottom of the grill once you ve added enough stack the charcoal into a cone or pyramid shape in the center of the grill 3 x research source soak the coals with lighter fluid if necessary check your bag of coals to see if they require lighter fluid or if they are pre treated if they require lighter fluid carefully pour it onto the cone of coals focusing on the center the amount of lighter fluid you should use will vary but a good approximation is adding 1 4 cup 60 ml of fluid per 1 lb 450 g of charcoal 4 x research source if your coals are pre treated with lighter fluid you don t need to add additional lighter fluid allow the lighter fluid to soak into the coals for approximately thirty minutes before lighting 5 x research source light the coals use long fireplace matches to light the cone light several areas of the coals to ensure that the fire takes to the whole pile you can discard the matches directly into the grill if desired allow the coals to burn until they are all grayish white on the surface spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the grill use a long handled instrument such as a pair of tongs put the grate into place and close the grill s lid let the coals burn until the edges turn grey this should take about five to ten minutes 6 x research source pack charcoal into a chimney starter place the chimney starter on the open grill most chimney starters will hold approximately one hundred coals how much charcoal you need will depend on how hot your want your grill for high heat fill the chimney for medium heat fill it halfway for low heat fill it one quarter full 7 x research source add newspaper to the chimney starter your chimney starter has a spot on the bottom to add paper fill the space with one or two pieces of paper any kind of paper works for example if you have old newspapers lying around you can use them to start your chimney you don t need to add lighter fluid to the charcoal when you use a chimney starter light the paper use a long match or lighter to set the paper alight light it on several spots to ensure the fire spreads as the paper burns it will ignite the charcoal in your chimney 8 x research source watch the coals to make sure they begin to turn grey if not light another piece of paper under your chimney pour out the coals when most of the coals are grey and you start to see flames on top of your chimney pour the coals out into your grill spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the grill with a long handled instrument such as a pair of tongs ensure that the propane tank is filled and connected properly the fitting for the hoses should be tight and you shouldn t smell gas leaking out most propane tanks have a gauge that tells you when they need to be refilled refer to your grill s user manual to make sure that your fuel tank is connected securely and has enough propane in it to cook with 9 x research source open the valve on your gas tank slowly turn the valve until it is fully open to release the gas leave it open for approximately one minute to allow the gas to travel through the fuel line 10 x research source open the first burner using the knob on the front of the grill turn the first burner to the high start setting this will allow the propane to begin flowing through this burner 11 x research source ignite the burner after allowing the propane to flow through the burner press the igniter button on the front of your grill to ignite the gas from that burner 12 x research source if the igniter button does not work light the burner manually by holding a lit match against it with the gas on turn on the gas and hold a match near the ignition burner turn the knob to high start the burner should ignite if the burner does not ignite with the button or a match within ten seconds turn off the gas and wait a few minutes before trying again leaving the gas on can lead to propane accumulating dangerously in the air open and ignite the remaining burners turn the knob for each burner to the high start position it s likely that the new burners will ignite on their own from the fire of the first burner if not press the igniter button again or light the burners with a long match leave the burners on the high setting and close the grill s lid allow the grill to heat up for at least five minutes before cooking anything 13 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to use an offset smoker,offset smokers may look intimidating but they re easy to use once you learn how to regulate the heat light briquettes and dump them in the firebox to get the smoker started add your food to the cooking chamber and then maintain a low temperature as the food smokes adjust the vents and add more coals to keep the fire going consider adding moisture or flavored woods to make your food really stand out,season the smoker if necessary if you re using a new offset smoker wipe down the entire smoker with soapy water rinse the smoker to wash away any dust grease or shavings let the smoker dry and then spritz vegetable oil over the inside of the cooking chamber open all of the vents on the smoker and light a fire in the firebox burn a fire for 30 minutes with the vents open 1 x research source let the fire die out and cool the smoker to use another time or use the smoker once it s burned hot for 30 minutes set two temperature probes in the smoker buy two digital air probes that you can insert into the cooking chamber place one probe near your food at each end of the cooking chamber for the most accurate readings use probes attached to wires if you d like to be able to move them or mount the probes onto the grates of the cooking chamber 2 x research source avoid relying on the built in thermometer at the top of the smoker s lid this thermometer measures the temperature that s on top of the grill instead of the space where your food is smoking open the air intake vent and chimney vent since fire needs oxygen open the air intake vent on the side of the firebox you ll also need to open the vent on the chimney so smoke can be released 3 x research source the vents can also be called dampers or baffles you ll adjust these during the smoking process to regulate heat and smoke within the smoker light a chimney full of briquettes fill a chimney starter full of charcoal briquettes and light them heat the briquettes until they begin to glow and ash over this should take about 15 minutes 4 x research source spread the coals in the firebox and close the lid once the briquettes are lightly ashy and hot dump them into the firebox if you want to add flavor to the smoke include one or two logs of hardwood the options include hickory mesquite apple and maple close the lid on the firebox and cooking chamber 5 x research source avoid making the fire completely with wood because it s hard to regulate and maintain over a long period of time bring the smoker up to temperature monitor the temperature inside the cooking chamber until it gets as hot as you d like most people prefer to smoke food between 225 f 107 c and 275 f 135 c keep the firebox and cooking chamber doors closed while you re preheating the smoker 6 x research source arrange your food on the grill grate place the food you want to smoke on the racks in the cooking chamber if you like put cold meat directly into the smoker without bringing it to room temperature first since it will absorb more smoke when it s cold close the lid of the cooking chamber 7 x research source add briquettes to the firebox to maintain the fire if you need to maintain the heat in the smoker or bring it higher add unlit charcoal briquettes to the firebox use a grill hoe to scoot the ashy coals to one side to make room for half a chimney full of new briquettes on the other side 8 x research source you ll need to check the temperature and firebox every 30 minutes or so to ensure that the fire is still going increase the heat in the smoker if necessary if the temperature inside the cooking chamber is dropping or stalling and you ve already added new briquettes add a log of wood to the firebox open the air intake vent on the side of the firebox to really get the fire going nice and hot for an extreme increase in temperature you can also open the chimney vent close the vents as soon as the smoker is at the right temperature 9 x research source keep an eye on the smoker temperature while the vents are open you ll only need to keep the vents open for one to two minutes to bring the heat up reduce the temperature in the smoker if necessary if the temperature inside the cooking chamber is getting too hot ensure that the vents are closed if the temperature is still high open the cooking chamber lid for about a minute this will drop the temperature quickly 10 x research source add a few wood chunks to the firebox place 1 to 2 large chunks of wood for smoking into the firebox every hour or so set the wood next to the fire so it smolders instead of burns quickly avoid using wood chips because these will burn off too quickly 11 x research source use hardwoods fruitwoods or nutwoods to get the best flavored smoke for your food you don t need to soak the wood since the moisture might cool off the coals in the firebox rotate the food once an hour every hour open the cooking chamber lid and use tongs to move the food turn the food so that pieces at the cooler side of the cooking chamber are moved nearer to the firebox 12 x research source if you re smoking a single large piece of meat it s still important to rotate the meat so it smokes evenly place a pan of water in the firebox if you re worried that your food will dry out over a long smoking session introduce moisture into the firebox set a metal rack over the coals in the firebox fill a disposable aluminum pan with water and set the pan on the rack the smoke will become moist before it flows into the cooking chamber 13 x research source spray the food to keep it moist add moisture by spraying the food with apple juice water or beer fill a clean spray bottle with your liquid and spritz the food towards the end of the smoking session spritz the food when it starts to look dry spray the food every 15 minutes or so by the end of the smoking session 14 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to decide between a charcoal or gas barbecue,this article is intended to help any would be barbeque purchaser or user make a choice between a charcoal barbeque or a gas model there s a fair amount to consider here if purchasing as a gift it s probably best to discuss it with the recipient if you re choosing for yourself read on from step number one below,think about how much time you want to spend in preparation almost 40 minutes are required in order for the initial flames of charcoal to die down giving you with the whitened cinders essential for your first hamburger gas is virtually instant needs no real warm up time five minutes may be helpful to get the griddle nice and hot in the event you need to though and you probably won t be burning an entire box of matches trying to light the thing on a breezy day 1 x research source one concluding consideration is convenience if you might have quite a few folks arriving in staggered shifts you may generally stop and start gas barbecues with ease whereas charcoal is a lot more problematic to keep going or restart consider clean up dirty coals that would need to be cleared away afterwards lead quite a few people to consider gas the cleaner option however more intricate gas barbecues have tricky parts to wash just like those annoying kitchen gas hobs you hate washing 2 x research source consider how much control you want over the cooking process even though both types can utilise a higher rack for lesser heat gas barbecues have genuine adjustable heat control gas is thus far more food friendly as you are able to adjust the temperature to your own needs and not overcook things 3 x research source for that reason far more challenging or fragile items can generally be cooked with ease on gas furthermore more substantial gas barbecues have increasingly more burners divide the whole cooking area into individually adjustable zones however you ll find frequently many dead locations on less costly models so unequal cooking could be a challenge with charcoal you will be the person in charge and can spread the coals out for equal cooking but piled up locations for many types of heat is just much too tricky to bother with think about taste gas barbecues rely on heat distributing materials which work to vaporise drippings and cause a delicious smoke gas devotees will tell you that this produces a flavour just as fine as charcoal but then it does not explain why people make a great deal of money supplying packs that you just burn on a gas barbecue to try to create a far more woody flavour you can find animated and conflicting opinions on whether you can tell the difference between meat grilled on gas or charcoal but it is normally a question of if gas tastes as good as charcoal never the other way around as the debate rolls on it s obvious that it s actually the natural smokiness discovered in charcoal grilling that all bbqs hope to achieve 4 x research source crunch your numbers the initial expense on a gas barbecue is normally considerably more than with charcoal having said that the price of every single sack of charcoal is really considerably higher than the quantity of gas you will use in contrast as a result it truly is a balance concerning the regularity of barbecuing and the size you want modest amounts of people every now and then go charcoal lots of folk frequently gas may perhaps save you a lot more in the long run 5 x research source try to avoid thinking too much and ask yourself what you actually have to have if the straightforwardness and flexibility of gas may be the most tempting characteristic then possibly you don t even need to have a barbecue and the simple kitchen grill will carry out the exact same work for no additional charge on the other hand if you happen to be set on that backyard grilling appliance then you need to visualize your self manning the station do you need to fire it up quickly have minute heat control to obtain that flawlessly cooked steak and not need to faff with coals go gas all the same quite a few of you are picturing the watering eyes the white hot smoky coals along with the strangely delicious over done beef that exclusively charcoal will provide in the event you take pleasure in the usual image of a cluster of men huddling around and disagreeing over the very best time to start off grilling then gas will just be no fun finally when you are just in search of a fast blast every now and then and do not definitely care an excessive amount then an inexpensive small scale charcoal barbecue will save you a great deal of hassle and nobody will shout at you when you leave it out virtually all winter to go rusty 6 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
how to grill indoors,grilled food has a special taste and a unique look which can be hard to replicate when you are cooking indoors however if you live in an apartment with no outdoor space for a grill or it s freezing outside you may have to resort to other methods fortunately grilling indoors with an electric grill or a grill pan is an easy way to reproduce that outdoor look and feel without actually having to go outside,look for an electric grill most people have heard of the george foreman electric grills and similar brands which come in many sizes and grill both sides of the food at one time however you should shop around to find the one that suits your needs and kitchen space best for example there are three main types of indoor grills a countertop model with one sided grilling a countertop model with dual sided grilling and a range top that sits on a stove burner and mimics an outdoor grill 1 x research source countertop models like the hamilton beach or delonghi are often electric smokeless and easy to clean due to their non stick surfaces a range top or stovetop grill like the staub rectangular grill pan can create a lot of smoke if you cook a lot at once however they are better for mimicking the look and feel of an outdoor grill because you can get the same kind of char marks 2 x research source look at different types of grill pans if you don t want to sacrifice counter space even momentarily consider buying a grill pan these are similar to any normal pan except they have grooves that mimic the grate of a grill which allows you to get the same kind of char marks you d find on an outdoor setup most grill pans are cast iron or stainless steel like the anolon tri ply clad deep round grill they are also usually non stick and small enough to be stored in a cupboard with other pans 3 x research source look for a grill with an adjustable heat setting some grills come with only one setting while other grills allow you to raise or lower the heat throughout the cooking process being able to adjust the temperature of your grill while cooking will help make sure you cook your food all the way through without burning it most if not all range top grills will adjust the temperature with your stove however depending on the width and length they may heat sections differently an electric grill like the cuisinart griddler will allow you to change the temperature separately on each plate which is great if you want to cook two different foods at one time 4 x research source check on the liquid disposal and cleaning most contact or countertop grills come with a slanted surface that allows the fat to drip off or drain through the center they may also even come with a built in plate or tray to collect it however for range top models like grill pans there is usually no method for draining excess oils so cleaning is more difficult countertop grills are usually non stick and contained which means you won t have a lot of oil or fat splattering all over your counter they are also relatively easy to clean with just hot water and paper towels 5 x research source rangetop grills or grill pans on the other hand can be a bit messier depending on the size or how much food you are cooking they can cause a lot of smoke and can spray a lot of kitchen area with oil however the cleaning is about the same as a countertop grill add liquid smoke just a small amount of this product will give your food the same smoky flavor you d get from an outdoor grill you can use it on anything too steaks burgers pork chops chicken even on vegetables you can find liquid smoke in most grocery stores just look in the sections for marinades and barbecue sauces 6 x research source when using liquid smoke simply pour a small amount of it over your food be careful of using too much though as it may add a chemical taste to your food when overused also double check the ingredients when purchasing as some companies may add extra seasonings that alter the flavor 7 x research source keep an eye on timing some indoor grills might require you to cook your food a little longer than outdoor grills this is especially true when it comes to electric grills as the heating method requires the coils to heat up first on the other hand with a range top that uses your stove the heat source is stronger and more direct just keep in mind that if you are using a grill pan over two burners you are going to have areas that don t heat as quickly use a meat thermometer to ensure your food is cooking long enough the cook time for your food will depend on the cut of meat and what type of indoor grill you re using however expect anywhere between 4 10 minutes for beef in a double sided grill 4 6 minutes for poultry and 6 10 minutes for pork if you are using a one sided grill you can expect the time to double 8 x research source care for your indoor grill properly do not use metal utensils on nonstick surfaces and avoid harsh cleaning ingredients on your iron grill pans for example try sticking with just hot water and a light dish soap as using a harsh scrub brush or steel wool on your indoor grills will wear down the surface and lead to uneven heating in the future 9 x research source even if you feel you have an excess of charred residue simply run your grill under hot water and scrub lightly with a sponge the nonstick surface will ensure any leftovers come off easily expand your collection of recipes you can find recipes designed specifically for indoor grills on websites magazines and books check out sites such as foodnetwork com and epicurious com for regularly updated recipes you can also look for cookbooks on amazon com or at your local bookstore take advantage of grilling vegetables vegetables are an important and healthy component to any meal grilling veggies outdoors can be complicated because the grill gets so hot but on an indoor grill or grill pan you can control the cooking temperature and time try grilling corn asparagus zucchini or squash you can even cut up a mix of these and put them together in foil with some oil and spices like rosemary or thyme before putting them on the grill most vegetables should grill in 5 10 minutes try grilling different types of foods don t limit yourself to just meat and vegetables instead try grilling pizza potatoes and bread for example you can grill a pizza dough in just 1 2 minutes just make sure the bottom of the dough has browned before you add your toppings you can also make wonderfully crispy garlic bread and grilled cheese,Food-and-Entertaining

prefer them for the particularly smoky taste that they provide by being fueled with charcoal charcoal grills take longer to start up and require cleanup after each use choose a gas grill if you have a larger budget gas grills are fueled by liquid propane or natural gas and give you better control of temperature you can get a good quality gas grill from around 200 to about 400 there are gas grills out there with price tags in the thousands but even if you really want to impress neighbors gas grills any more expensive than 800 don t increase much in quality 2 x research source this option may be more expensive but it requires a bit less time and effort 3 x research source opt for an electric grill if you live in an apartment complex electric grills are great for those who don t care to deal with the inconvenience of traditional grilling gas and charcoal grills provide more flavor but can require a few different products and steps with electric grills you just plug it into an outlet and you re good to go 4 x research source entertain crowds with a smoker smokers slow cook large amounts of food over a longer period of time and pack in the flavor smokers are much bigger than your average grill and can function electronically or be fueled by charcoal or propane keep in mind that there are other options while charcoal gas electric and smokers are the most popular there are several other grill types that might fit your needs better some other types of grills are hybrid a grill that can use propane one day and charcoal the next pellet a grill that functions much like a charcoal grill but uses mesquite pecan apple or hickory wood chips instead portable a mobile grill that s ideal for camping and tailgating and comes in either gas charcoal or electric go big if you frequently host parties or cater getting a larger grill will minimize your time grilling for large groups and allow everyone to eat at the same time if you intend to grill for many people at once 550 to 650 inches is a good size purchase a smaller grill if you don t have much space to work with don t forget to measure the area that you intend to grill in before selecting one grills come in all shapes and sizes and some even have mobile capabilities whether you have a huge backyard or an apartment patio you should be able to find something that suits your space get a larger grill to cook larger cuts of meat effectively smaller cuts of steak chicken and vegetables can be grilled with a smaller grill without a problem if you re interested in cooking larger meats such as racks of ribs you ll need something with a greater surface area 5 x research source choose a grill with shelves grilling utensils plates of uncooked food marinades seasonings and more all need a place to go while you re grilling and not having a place to put them can be frustrating get a grill with sturdy shelves on the sides to satisfy this storage necessity 6 x research source get a built in thermostat to avoid undercooking and overcooking being able to tell the temperature of the inside of the grill at all times is a big benefit meat is especially sensitive to temperature so the more aware you are of it the better the meat will turn out 7 x research source prioritize power if you re grilling a lot at once a grill s power is measured by how many british thermal units or btus of heat it produces frequently btus increase along with grill size if you re only grilling for a few you don t need to worry as much about this but it s an important feature for large quantity grillers 8 x research source a grill with 12 000 btus per burner has the capability of cooking a lot and cooking quickly 9 x research source purchase a grill cover to preserve your grill a grill cover is a worthy investment because it will lengthen the lifespan of your grill by protecting it from the elements go for an unlined vinyl polyester oil cloth or weather proof nylon cover stay away from felt lined and flannel lined grill covers mice and squirrels like to use the fabric as nesting material it is especially necessary to get a cover if your grill is made of stainless steel because it will protect your grill from tarnishing 10 x research source make sure your gas grill has at least two stainless steel or brass burners having at least two burners allows you to have one off and one on it s better if you can get a grill with even more burners because this will allow you to have different heat zones which may be useful when grilling several types of food at a time stay away from aluminum and cast iron burners because they rust and corrode easily 11 x research source buy a grilling basket or sheet to keep smaller foods from falling it can be very challenging to grill vegetables and certain types of seafood such as shrimp without having a few fall into the flames or onto the ashes getting this accessory along with the grill itself will keep that from happening 12 x research source stay away from unnecessary and complicated features if you re a novice especially if you re a little new to grilling think twice before splurging on smoke boxes electric charcoal starters and rotisseries

how to use a vertical water smoker,cooking with a vertical water smoker is a great way to infuse foods with a smoky flavor there are three main types of water smokers charcoal gas and electric each kind is used a little differently whichever kind of water smoker you use it s important that you use enough water and maintain a consistent temperature by setting up your vertical water smoker the right way and giving your food enough time to smoke you can easily smoke a variety of different foods,fill the water bowl in the smoker with water you can also use beer wine seasoned water and other liquids to smoke your food open the access door on the front of your smoker and pull out the water bowl the water bowl is located above the charcoal tray and below the food chamber at the top fill the bowl with your desired liquid and then put it back in the smoker 1 x research source use a chimney starter to light charcoal for the smoker set the chimney starter on the metal grate at the bottom of the smoker under the water bowl slide a piece of newspaper under the chimney starter and fill the starter to the brim with charcoal use a long lighter to light the newspaper under the starter which will ignite the charcoal let the charcoal burn for 10 20 minutes 2 x research source use a pair of grilling mitts to grab the handle on the chimney starter when you re ready to dump the charcoal out dump the charcoal on the grate at the bottom of the smoker place the food you want to smoke on the grates in the food chamber the food chamber is the uppermost section of the smoker just above the water bowl don t overcrowd the grates with food or the food won t smoke properly 3 x research source keep the smoker heated to around 225 250 f 107 121 c check the temperature using the thermometer on the lid of the smoker if your smoker doesn t have a built in thermometer stick a cooking thermometer through one of the vents in the side of the smoker to check the temperature check the temperature every 30 minutes to make sure it s staying in the right range 4 x research source if the smoker is too hot try shutting the vents and adding ice cubes to the water bowl you may need to remove some of the charcoal to get the temperature down 5 x research source if the smoker is too cold open the vents and add more charcoal 6 x research source add more charcoal and water as needed check the charcoal and water levels every hour if the charcoal is getting low add a few more pieces make sure there s least 2 inches 5 cm of water in the water bowl at all times 7 x research source take the food off the grates once it s finished use a meat thermometer to check any meat to make sure it s fully cooked the amount of time you should let the food smoke depends on what you re smoking and how big it is some basic smoking times for foods being cooked at 225 250 f 107 121 c are spare ribs six to seven hours brisket one and a half hours per pound whole chicken four hours whole turkey six and a half hours close the lid and any vents on the smoker to help the charcoal go out it could take several hours for the charcoal to go out open the lid and vents once the charcoal is out to help the rest of the smoker cool down once the smoker is cool to the touch remove the water bowl and empty any water inside 8 x research source fill the water pan with the liquid of your choice you can use water beer wine or any other liquid to smoke your food the water pan is located just below the food shelves in the smoker remove the water pan to fill it up and then slide it back into the smoker 9 x research source connect a propane tank to the smoker there should be a gas hose extending out of the bottom of the smoker attach the end of the hose to the valve on the propane tank read the manual that came with your smoker for specific attachment instructions 10 x research source use the controls on the front of the smoker to ignite the burner look for a button that says ignite and press it in your smoker might have a knob you need to turn to the on position before you re able to ignite it if you re having trouble figuring out how to ignite your smoker refer to the manual that came with it 11 x research source if your smoker doesn t ignite when you press the ignite button turn any knobs on the smoker to the off position and turn off the gas leave the door to the smoker open and give the gas a few minutes to clear out before you try to ignite it again 12 x research source set the temperature using the control knob on the smoker the knob should be located near where the ignition button is set the temperature to around 225 250 f 107 121 c some vertical water smokers may only have a low medium and high setting refer to the manual to find out the temperature range for each of these

how to buy a gas barbecue,a quick guide to aid you in the search for a new gas barbecue,look at how it is built stainless steel or metal with a porcelain enamel finish are the very best constructions giving a combination of toughness rust protection and straightforward cleaning contemplate the lid the heavier the greater as this normally indicates build quality also consider your own diy skills welded pre built barbecues are likely to be much more sturdy but it is possible to buy one and assemble your self if you like which may save you cash in terms of dimension contemplate if you would like different height grills or additional touches like plate warming areas utensil storage table places etc as expected extra unique touches equals a lot more cash consider the burners and heat distribution gas barbecues rely on a process of gas burners that are covered by warmth distributing materials which also act to burn off drippings to smoke the food cheaper designs use lava rocks or ceramic coals for this purpose and do an ok job although grease can accumulate and cause flash fires which we all know and hate from charcoal when you really want the most effective look out for long bars or flavourisers that are designed to vaporize drippings quite rapidly to keep away from flares and create a smoky flavour although you still won t match charcoal in many an opinion as for the number of gas burners you get what you fork out for less costly one burner versions only enable the flame to be controlled over the entire cooking surface and can have cold spots which may perhaps lead to uneven temperatures two three burner types are genuinely worth it offering you differing regions of temperature to cook different foods even so if you re seriously feeling flush you may go for even much more burners infrared heat sources a bit over the top and rotisserie back burners for that michelin starred experience try to keep away from side burners as these are high priced added touches and you ll most likely find you don t use them you have variable warmth control on the primary grill anyway and the side space is much better off reserved for your raw meat or a huge glass of beer consider energy use as burner numbers and size increases you may expect the quantity of gas you need to power the barbecue to increase that being said efficiency is also a consideration so if you are in doubt search for the btu british thermal unit score of the barbecue to see how much gas you will will need really don t get too worried about it though the only real time to worry is if a big design has a strangely low btu rating when compared to comparable sized versions far from becoming extra efficient a substantially lower rating can indicate poor energy output and you ll have a colder barbecue this is rare though the gas applied in most designs called propane is really much less costly than charcoal and a single canister can last for a number of cookouts should you just want a straightforward gas barbecue that can do a very good job go for a one or two burner design costs and features will vary but search for a medium size with lava rocks or ceramic coals and try your best to get a model with as even cooking as feasible side burners or storage parts will only push up the price so a quality primary burner is much much more crucial in this range also really do not expect swanky looks concentrate instead on durability if you want a mid range barbecue go for three burners you ll need to look for stainless steel construction and a large grilling area but still not be tempted by too many additional touches in addition at this selling price go for flavouriser bars instead or lava rocks or ceramic coals you ll end up with a significantly better flavour when you move into the luxury barbecue market things start getting incredibly serious and far more expensive having said that have a look around at the 4 burner types from landmann electrolux and beefeater when you really want some impressive kit at this size anticipate sleek and solid metal with warranty infrared rotisseries enough space to cook for a mob and plenty of envy from your friends,Food-and-Entertaining

spices and ingredients you may want to consider roasting the fish in an aluminum foil packet instead of placing it directly on the barbecue 6 x research source place the fillets skin side down on the grill 7 x research source cooking the skin side first will help the fish hold together if your fish doesn t have skin that s fine just place it on the grill cook it on the first side for three to five minutes it takes about eight minutes to cook through an inch of fish so for most fillets this means three to five minutes per side watch as the fish s flesh starts to cook and become opaque as the grill heats it from below flip the fish and finish cooking for another three to five minutes the best tool to use for the job is a fish spatula but any other type of metal spatula will do flip the fish carefully onto the other side remove the fish to a plate when it s finished the fish should flake easily when poked with a fork and be opaque all the way through to the center the internal temperature of fish should be a minimum of 145 degrees fahrenheit 62 8 degrees celsius when finished 8 x research source buy a fresh whole fish any type of whole fish does great on a barbecue since

you re cooking whole fish a whole fish takes about three times as long to cook as a fillet score the skin 10 x research source this will help the fish cook more evenly by opening the fish up to additional heat use a sharp paring knife to make a few slashes perpendicular to the backbone on both sides of the fish make longer deeper slashes toward the head where there s more meat and the fish cooks more slowly the tail area cooks more quickly season the fish inside and out 11 x research source rub olive oil all over the fish and sprinkle salt and pepper both inside and out if you d like to stuff the inside cavity with additional seasonings and herbs feel free to do so here are a few popular seasoning combinations a few slices of lemon and a few sprigs of thyme minced garlic with rosemary sliced red onion and butter place the fish in indirect heat instead of placing it right over the hot coals or fire place it on a part of the grill that gets indirect heat so it won t end up burning the heat should be steady and medium or else the skin could burn before the fish is done place the fish so that the tail is furthest from the flames barbecue the fish for eight to ten minutes per side each side should be cooked eight to ten minutes per inch of thickness the fish is ready to be flipped when the meat flakes when poked with a fork when one side is done flip the fish and continue cooking for another eight to ten minutes 12 x research source another way to tell whether once side is sufficiently cooked is by moving the fish slightly with a spatula if the skin no longer sticks it s ready if the fish sticks it may not be finished cooking on that side give it another few minutes then work it loose carefully when done the internal temperature of fish should be a minimum of 145 degrees fahrenheit 62 8 degrees celsius 13 x research source place the fish on a platter lift it carefully onto a plate and garnish with lemon slices and herbs to serve flake it from the bones

series of deep slits into the fish s skin on both sides cutting at a 45 angle make the slits deep enough to reach the bone and space them out around 1 to 2 inches 2 5 to 5 1 cm apart this will help the fish cook more evenly 22 x research source use a well sharpened chef s knife since a dull knife might tear up or mangle the meat season the fish s inside cavity with salt and pepper add salt and black pepper to the inner cavity of the fish to taste this will give you a juicy and flavorful result if your fish is big enough you can also stuff it with tasty herbs aromatics or citrus slices 23 x research source for example you could stuff your fish with garlic and butter rosemary lemon slices green onions or basil as a more complex alternative to salt and pepper coat the inner cavity with a

good way to prevent sticking 26 x research source to help the fish cook more evenly consider using indirect heat this involves setting the fish on an area of the grill that s not directly over a heat source for example make a pile of coals under one side of the grate then put the fish on the other side 27 x research source let your fish cook for 3 4 minutes with the grill hood closed cover the grill and leave the fish alone for a few minutes resist the urge to check on the fish or try to turn them before 3 4 minutes have passed since you could accidentally damage the fish 28 x research source after a few minutes have passed slip a spatula under an edge of the fish and see if it lifts easily off the grill if the fish lifts up easily it s ready to turn if not give it another 30 seconds to 1 minute then check again most whole fish will take about 10 minutes per 1 inch 2 5 cm of thickness to cook through completely 29 x research source if you re cooking a thick fish you may need to wait longer e g 5 7 minutes before turning it over flip the fish once it comes off the grill easily take a wide thin spatula and gently slide it under the fish if the fish is ready to turn it should release from the grill grate without a fight carefully flip the fish over onto the other side then close the grill and let it cook for another few minutes 30 x research source if you re cooking a big fish stabilize it by sliding 2 spatulas under it at once you can also use a flexible fish turner to hold the top of the fish while you slide a metal spatula underneath it test the fish for doneness by flaking it with a fork gently insert a fork or the tip of a knife into the thickest part of the fish and see if it flakes if the fish flakes easily and is just barely opaque it s time to take it off the grill 31 x research source let the fish rest for about 5 minutes before you serve it during the rest period the fish will finish cooking and the juices will have time to spread through the flesh you can also test the fish by holding the cavity open with a spatula and flaking the meat next to the backbone with a knife 32 x research source,Food-and-Entertaining
