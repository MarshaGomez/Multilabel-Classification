how to make a travel brochure,a creative expertly written and well designed travel brochure invites readers to cast themselves into a story that takes place in an exotic locale in this article learn how to make an enticing travel brochure that will have your audience fantasizing about and booking your travel packages,choose the destination of your potential clients if you are a professional working for a travel company your destination of choice will be the one you work for if you are a student and are creating a pretend travel brochure you will want to pick out a desirable exotic and interesting location a professional should already know what destination they are representing or attempting to advertise for use this step to get to know the key features of your location mountains lakes cabins museums parks etc write each of these key features down on a piece of paper for use later on if you are a student find an exciting place to advertise for some great examples are mexico hawaii myrtle beach south carolina the beaches of florida or australia to name just a few research the location you choose using reputable sources such as online search engines encyclopedias library books etc and find out key features about the location write each of these down on a piece of paper for use later on the lists for both students and professionals should be extra long at the beginning it is better to create a long list to start and then cross off items later on explore and locate the amenities of the location these include but are not limited to restaurants shops bathrooms movie theaters etc it is important that your potential client knows what amenities are available to them at your destination and where they are located travel around the website by yourself and write down what and where the particular amenity is if you are far away from where you are advertising for look for maps online that might help you locate particular amenities sites like google maps often point out exactly what and where each of these is after you have created a detailed list of the amenities put a star next to the items you think are most important bathrooms generally are a top priority make sure to note whether these amenities provide additional accommodations such as being handicap accessible 1 x research source find out what the residents are saying if your destination has residential accommodations if you live with or near persons whom live there talk to them get their opinions first hand accounts of what the destination is like visit peoples homes and ask them politely to give their opinion remember to bring a pencil and paper to write down exactly what they say you can also bring a voice recorder if you do not write very fast if the destination is strictly for vacation non residential try calling people whom have vacationed there in the past as with the previous step write down exactly what they have to say about their experience students who do not have direct contact with persons whom live or have vacationed there should look online find internet sites that link you with local hotels restaurants etc in the area of your destination look for reviews that have to do with the destination mexico hawaii etc rather than a particular place of accommodation write down what they have to say 2 x research source pick your target audience for every destination you will need to figure out what demographic group will be most interested this will not only help you highlight particular accommodations but also create a brochure that is visually stimulating to your targeted demographic group use your list of key features and amenities to pick a target audience here are some key examples which will help vacation spots with lots of bathrooms and restaurants available are great for an older demographic audience destinations which are primarily vacation spots non residential usually target a younger audience or newlywed couples going on their honeymoon vacation spots which have hotels furnished with wifi and cable tv are great destinations for families destinations which have large rooms are great for business workers who are looking to conduct work from far away this is not an all encompassing list but it will give you an idea about what to look for and how to pick the right demographic audience something you might think is minor a boardwalk for example might make all the difference in the world for a particular clientele determine the price of your travel package this is the most important step of all you need to make a reasonable profit but you also do not want to scare away potential visitors if you are a professional the price of the trip will probably already be determined take into account the previous four steps and in particular the target demographic group set a standard price to each of the amenities and add them all up set a standard price for all of the key features of the destination and add them all up finally add the price of the amenities and destination hot spots together adjust the vacation cost according to who the audience is younger clientele and families will most likely be looking for a cheaper vacation older clientele and business types will have more money to spend generally speaking vacations for a family of four should run between 1000 and 2000 go higher or lower as you see fit how to calculate cost of travel create a preliminary outline before you begin to publish a final copy you will want to practice writing exactly what you want to say in the brochure this is a great time to check spelling grammar and punctuation first you ll want to create a story just like a good novel pulls in a reader the client wants to feel as if they are going on an adventure in paragraph form full sentences write a convincing argument for why your vacation spot is the best place to visit after you have written down your argument go back and proofread more importantly cross out extraneous information keep what is critical and add in to places that need a more exciting or convincing argument this argument can then be split apart into different sections of your brochure you might have to tailor the sentences to exist as a stand alone argument in the different sections but this will give you a good head start it is important that the writer knows exactly why each of the individual pieces are critical and how they come together to convince the clientele use specialized fonts and lettering the brochure should be legible and easy to follow there should be an overall flow to the brochure and it should not feel discombobulated 3 x research source your heading title should appear in bold lettering underlined and be large enough to read from far away if someone is sitting in a doctors office or at a coffee shop they should be able to see the title clearly at the top of the brochure each of the subheadings section headings should also be in bold and underlined they should be a slightly smaller font size than the title they should all also all be the same font if one subtitle is in times new roman keep them all times new roman this creates a nice flow to your brochure and does not bog down the viewer in trying to comprehend the brochure write a captivating title simple tag lines like mexican vacation or hawaiian vacation are going to bore the potential vacationers and not draw them in to read the rest of the brochure you need to use descriptive adjectives possibly even verbs to entice the viewer 4 x research source write down some adjectives you know that are not typically used such as adventurous pulsating mind boggling fanciful breathtaking etc put these words first in your title so that the readers eyes reading left to right will catch that key word then make sure to include the location in the title if you advertising for a hawaiian vacation do not leave out the word hawaii put the location right after the adjective following the name of the place you can finish the title with simply vacation or a synonym end the title in an exclamation point so that it appears that the person selling the vacation is just as excited as the potential clientele bold the lettering and underline the title a good example is adventurous mount everest vacation hook your audience with the opening sentence this sentence should appear on the first flap the reader opens up to think of this sentence as a thesis statement of a paper you want to make the argument for this vacation clear right up front the reader is not going to look around the rest of the brochure if they are not convinced at the very beginning this would be a great time to simply list off a few of the accommodations hot spots for example an all encompassing hawaiian vacation that includes beautiful scenery top of the line hotels and all the food you can eat write each of your sections your brochure is going to be about half visuals and half written words therefore for each section of the brochure you will only use a few sentences 3 4 to explain each distinct aspect of the vacation you will want to include at the bare minimum the following sections restaurants hotels scenery appearance of the vacation spot and shops these are four of the most basic things people need to know about before they go on the vacation in total you should have around six to eight sections make sure that what you are saying is necessary succinct and convincing consider what image you are using and make sure that the words match up feel free to highlight italicize or bold certain words or phrases this would also be a great time to add in those accommodations such as handicap accessible free continental breakfast bike walking trails etc copy and edit testimonials earlier you gathered and wrote down the personal experiences of people whom have previously been on vacation there this is a great time to not only include a summary of what they said but include block quotes to include block quotes in your brochure start by indenting then add a quotation mark and write in your quote finish by adding another quotation mark you will want to include only the most sensitive valuable information do not include bad experiences as this might turn off the clientele if you want to take out a sentence in the middle of a paragraph simply highlight and delete then in between the remaining sentences add three periods in a row this will allow you to shorten the quote keep what is necessary and highlight what is most important 5 x research source include a price section this is not an all encompassing section there is no need to create a chart showing them all the options however you should give them a ballpark figure as to how much the vacation should cost 6 x research source include some simple terms in your 3 4 sentence price section such as prices as low as 1000 for a family of four or prices start at 1500 and include great discounts if you purchase by phone mention the different offers deals vacationers can get through your particular company usually there are family discounts senior discounts children discounts etc this section should appear on the inside of the pamphlet to the far right at the end you do not want to start the brochure by introducing price nor do you want to put the price on the back of the brochure as the clientele will probably look there first and never look inside link the viewer to other sources this step is critical because the brochure will not be enough after the price section or on the back of the brochure include a section that links email addresses web page addresses phone numbers and a mailing address this should be done as a series of bulleted points or dashes do not write this information in paragraph form as it will all run together check a second and third time that the information is up to date and correct look at the bottom of webpages to see when the last time the page was updated call the numbers you are listing on the brochure and see who picks up the phone the information you are presenting needs to be accurate 7 x research source choose eye catching photos these photos will help you tell the story you want to tell the clientele should be excited and intrigued by what they see in the brochure some good examples include a smiling visitor hugging a dolphin at a sea life attraction or a woman relaxing with a massage in an open air spa that overlooks the tropical sunset make sure the photos are in color and have a high quality resolution do not use stock photos which generally look fake and off putting use real life images or photos you have taken yourself at the location people enjoy seeing others having fun so try to include photos of people enjoying themselves at your destination rather than showing an empty hotel room or deserted beach this will invite readers to project themselves into the photo 8 x research source consider the color scheme carefully each vacation will have a different feel tone you will want to convey whether your destination is relaxing exciting or somewhere in between to convey a relaxed feeling appropriate for a spa use muted pastel tones children s destinations are best marketed with bright bold colors historical site brochures can be given an antique feeling with sepia and earth tones for each panel of the brochure use the same color if there are different colors for each panel it can become distracting and gaudy add in borders asterisks and designs while you never want to distract the viewer too much these three things can help in the aid of the story you are trying to tell use a thin border to contain each of the panels in your brochure a thick border can become distracting the border should be a color that is a slightly darker lighter shade of the tone that you use for the rest of the brochure if you want to highlight key points of your story use bullet points or asterisks generally 3 4 is the range you want to stay in try to highlight things that are not written about in the sentences designs can also help such as stars rainbows arrows etc add these where and when you see fit once more do not overuse these and bog down the viewer in the visuals the clientele should want to read more not necessarily look more organize the brochure so the copy and visuals work together the 3 4 sentence sections should match what the visuals are saying for example if you are talking about restaurants in your section use a picture of a restaurant invest in a professional printing company if you are a student a standard folded piece of paper will work just fine however professionals should look into printing brochures at facilities that specialize in printing tell the printing company that you want the brochures printed on high quality paper cheap flimsy paper can easily be torn ripped or water damaged thick coated paper provides resistance to accidents and can be carried around mush easier if you wind up needing to use your home or business printer just make sure to use thick heavy paper the settings of your printer should be set to the highest pixel quality so that your pictures come out clean and crisp provide a final copy proof make sure the printing company has not dramatically changed altered the layout or design of the brochure for both professionals and students this is a great time to go back and proofread one more time,Travel
how to travel on airplanes with a gun,if you enjoy shooting in places far from your home you will probably need to carry a gun and ammunition on an airplane to get to your destination while most gun destinations cater to high power rifles and shotguns many destinations are for target shooting matches where the guns are more typically 22 rifles pistols and air rifles,get a good case the best cases are those made by pelican 1 x research source starlight and similar companies these cases are tough supposedly a tank can roll over them without damage to the contents tsa and airline baggage handling is rough on cases so the best case is a requirement the typical walmart case simply will not do the best cases have foam linings that can be cut to fit your gun s in many cases you must make cutouts since the guns will not fit without cutting do not cut openings for ammunition even for car travel it is often illegal to have ammunition packed with the weapon you can provide for magazines and other gear though pistols can be packed inside of regular luggage since the theft of any gun is a consideration having a case that does not resemble a gun case can be an advantage obviously having your pistols enclosed in regular luggage provides this obfuscation some people pack rifles in golf club travel containers the pelican like cases are not as obviously gun cases as these are also used for demonstration equipment tools and instruments some people feel that scopes should be dismounted before travel with cases such as suggested with very thick foam this is probably not required but is a simple step that may prevent problems use a non tsa approved lock while many will tell you to use a tsa approved lock this is actually prohibited by 49cfr 1540 111 the regulation that governs firearm transportation 2 x research source it should be noted that the tsa usually allows the use of tsa locks but in reality they are not legal as they are designed to be opened by a tsa master key which is expressly prohibited by the above regulation the tsa will ask you to unlock the case or provide them a key do not give them the combination if a combination lock is used then they will visually inspect the packing of your gun after which they will either have you re lock your case or they will re lock it and return your key tsa agents are not trained or allowed to handle a firearm so no contact should be made in that manner if an agent feels the firearm requires in depth inspection they must have a law enforcement officer come over to perform that function if re inspection is deemed necessary after the bag is checked they will locate the owner and have them open the case again so it is wise to remain in the area or on the aircraft after checking the firearm buy the best non tsa locks you can find for guns the first step on arriving at the airport is to proceed directly to the baggage check in you cannot use curbside check in declare to the attendant when you get to the counter i have a gun to check note airgun air rifle air pistol are not considered firearms and do not require declaration but do have to be placed in checked baggage and it is wise to alert the agent as to avoid a delay due to a misunderstanding air tanks are not allowed past tsa without internal inspection that said a tank attached to a gun is considered to be part of the gun and not a tank thus limit yourself to one attached tank if you must have additional tanks either prepare them for internal inspection x ray is not enough unfortunately or ship them separately just in case it is a good idea to travel with the tools to allow internal inspection of an airgun tank the tanks should all have air pressure released before inspection or take the tool to release the pressure if necessary there is no danger of explosion from travel the attendant will ask for a declaration that the gun is unloaded there is a form you fill out with this declaration that goes into the gun case you will get a baggage tag for your gun and other luggage your gun will be sent to the tsa inspector for the next stage of processing 3 x research source ammunition can be packed separately in your checked luggage or in the same case as the gun as long as it is 75 caliber or less that is there are state restrictions on having ammo packed with the gun that may apply too there are usually airline limits on how much ammunition that can be carried typically 5 kilograms 11 pounds per person check with the airline for these limits again you can always ship ammunition separately while it is relatively easy to ship ammunition shipping guns is not simple 4 x trustworthy source u s transportation security administration u s government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols go to source tsa inspection is usually pretty cursory as stated above they are only allowed to visually inspect the firearms packing and the content of the case they are allowed to search the case in depth which may require manipulating the firearm somewhat along with the packing but no manipulation of the firearm in terms of opening the action removing parts or magazines or dis assembly of any type if this is deemed necessary by the agent they must have a law enforcement officer come to the area and perform that action while unlikely you may be asked to explain your reasons for traveling with a gun if so be nice a short and simple answer is all that is needed something like protection while on my trip hunting or attending a shooting event most likely nothing will be asked the most i have encountered to date have been statements of positive admiration for my firearms by the inspecting agents once the inspection is complete close and lock the case and put away your key your gun should then become luggage except for possibly being routed to special handling upon arrival at your destination while the airline may tell you that your guns will arrive in a different area than you baggage think skis in practice they will often just be luggage and arrive with your other bags ask the agent where to expect them if not informed and immediately check with the staff at the arriving airport as well but be ready to check both special handling and regular baggage arrivals in addition to the above for international travel you must obtain the rules and regulations for us customs and the country countries you will be visiting or transiting 5 x research source if possible plan your travel with direct flights this avoids not only possible delays but lost baggage and any problems with transporting a gun through a third country 6 x research source get all necessary forms from the host country early also back that up with a call to the host country embassy here in the us and make sure you re not missing anything event organizers can often provide most of the required information for getting a rifle into their country pistols may be far more difficult get a us customs to form 4457 signed in person by a customs office prior to leaving 7 x research source this is so that you can get your gun back into the us without paying duty especially applicable to guns made outside of the us this also applies to cameras and other foreign made items once you have this form hang on to it as it can be reused this can be done on departure day but make sure you have a customs office available at your departure airport call the office directly and do not depend on information from your airline regarding customs availability 8 x research source,Travel

how to make traveling long distance easier,we travel long distances for business family reasons or holidays and vacations but the trip itself is rarely a pleasure let s try making long distance travel easier,put your travel into perspective what one person considers a long distance might not be so long to others as a rough guide you might consider travel to be long if it s more than 8 hours by air more than 6 hours by train or more than 4 hours by car however what feels long depends on regional attitudes in the usa an 8 hour flight might seem long to australians who frequently fly direct to europe or the usa 18 24 hours is long but commonplace an english person may feel a 1 hour drive is long while another traveller may complete a longest single car drive from brisbane to sydney totalling 15 hours a trip is long when you make special preparations for it because you feel it is necessary due to the length of time you will be travelling get excited about your trip okay the travel itself might be a drag but your mindset will make all the difference if you re excited about where you re going and what you re doing the trip can be well worth it try to reframe your perception of the distance to avoid being overwhelmed by it if you can t do that at least focus on the end goal being worth it dress appropriately generally dress for where you re going to not where you re coming from an arran sweater is a trap in a singapore summer be comfortable use layers so that you can adjust to varying levels of air conditioning in airports planes stations trains cars and so on wear something with front pockets or have a bumbag or fanny pack so things are easier to reach e g sweets lozenges headache pills ear plugs napkin wear a suit if you have immediate business commitments but try to hang it up if in first or business class or carry it on board in a half length suit bag that will fit without crushing in an overhead locker consider wearing an angler s jacket these waistcoats have multiple forward pockets perfect for holding and easily reaching all your nick nacks when a meal or beverage comes your paperback slips in a pocket your passport is handy you can slip off the jacket at customs without having to unpack it pack an easily reached neck pillow these crescent shaped inflatable pillows can make sleeping or resting much more comfortable long flights sometimes offer blankets while these are often light they deflect air conditioning and provide psychological comfort if you don t have a neck pillow at home you can always pick one up at the airport itself most terminals have at least one shop selling inflatable bead filled or memory foam pillows of this sort and they re surprisingly inexpensive consider others avoid wearing strong perfume or after shave it might provoke reactions including allergic reactions from other passengers sitting beside someone who detests your perfume may make a 6 8 hour journey seem a lot longer prepare for the air conditioning many planes and even trains keep their cabins cold and crisp bring layers and consider minimising any makeup so that long travel doesn t make it cake and dry it on however consider a small travel tube of moisturiser as skin dries in prolonged air conditioning if you need prescription medicine pack one or two dosage bundles into a tiny jar or resealable sandwich bag this is better than opening pill packets while travelling as the contents may spill or jump awkwardly landing on the floor or disappearing if you forget and have to unpack pills go to the toilet put a plug or cloth in the sink and use the available washstand space pick your footwear with comfort and security in mind laces mean delays at security especially for tall boots wearing tall boots is easier than packing them but if so clear security early slip ons make life easier and some woman s flats can fold into hand luggage if bare feet make your journey more comfortable some shoe designs feature steel bars in the sole avoid these where security checks will mean multiple security checks and delays do your homework this is especially important if you ll be stuck on a long flight are meals offered at a cost or included in the price do you have special dietary needs and can you order before travelling remember to drink water hydration is important long trips are dehydrating if you feel hunger it may actually indicate that you have been ignoring symptoms of thirst for particularly long trips pack effervescent vitamin c b tablets vitamin c helps ward off many common ailments and vitamin b helps ease stress decide whether or not to drink alcohol if available and you want some have a little to relax and take the edge off the day don t drink to excess because you have a captive audience with access to social media and complaint systems get drunk on the ground where airborne antics won t get you barred from flying or blacklisted there is another reason to take care alcohol dissolves quicker into the bloodstream with carbonated drinks e g champagne or mixers and all alcohol dissolves faster into the bloodstream at altitude your safe limit may not apply take special care if travelling with infants consider other passengers and plan ahead the most common problem is pressurization which adults fix by yawning or blowing their nose to pop their ears babies don t know to do this and the resulting ear pressure can be unbearable babies compensate with their lungs but to little effect sucking can help equalise pressure but a crying baby will spit a dummy try getting your child to suck on your finger or feed the child your doctor or infant health centre may have other options plan your route and note the locations of fuel and rest stops and opportunities to buy food if you ll have to drive for long stretches without these facilities bring lots of snacks water and even some toilet paper and make sure you have enough fuel to get between stations check you have maps in case your gps fails do a little extra research to make sure there are no gps flaws on your route people have been directed into deserts and plan out where you think you ll stop for bathroom breaks food and gas bring plenty of snacks and drinks have a large water bottle in your drink holder with a bobble top or flip top bring some extra water along too in case you run out or a passenger wants some stay hydrated even if it means having to stop for bathroom breaks bring entertainment have music available but not so relaxing that it makes you drowsy consider books on tape as a way to stay awake and engaged while you drive if making your own compilation cd or playlist make every 5th song irritate you a little to keep you awake prepare your car for the distance if you re travelling far from your regular mechanic you might want to have them check out the car before you go make sure your tires are properly inflated your fluids oil water coolant levels are right and keep the windscreen clean a dusty or dirty screen diffuses light and creates glare get professional advice if considering petrol additives all these things affect peace of mind use driving gloves these improve grip and make a steering wheel easier to hold on a hot day take a break every two hours australia has a continuing national campaign called drive revive survive the slogan gets to the heart of the matter as a driver you need regular breaks to stay safe and to keep others around you safe don t power through any bouts of tiredness take a break stretch get a snack and drink some water and only return to the road when you re ready to focus again vary your route to stay engaged if you often drive the same route break the trip in different places and make a whistle stop tour of something different prepare for emergencies just in case have rain gear handy if needed pack a drop sheet or camping rug beside your emergency jack in case you need to get partway under the car make sure you have the basic mechanical equipment and know how needed to change a tire or jump start your car if the battery goes flat at a rest stop sign up with your local auto club in case you experience car troubles out of

a tour group visa is about 10 percent off this means you d be paying between 220 and 230 dollars per day fly directly into bhutan there is only one international airport in the country it is in a city called paro which is one hour away from thimphu the capital of bhutan only three airlines drukair bhutan airlines and buddha air fly into bhutan buddha air only does charter flights flights to bhutan

national dish is called ema datse which is a spicy curry that mixes chilies with farmer s cheese and is served with nutty red rice the meal is topped off ezay salsa which is made from dried chilies

how to travel spontaneously,traveling can be a pleasant carefree experience but the large amounts of planning and preparation which usually precede actually traveling can make the process seem like more trouble than it s worth if you d like to travel without putting in so much work beforehand try to travel more spontaneously making spontaneous travel plans can open doors to new experiences that you wouldn t have taken part in otherwise however you ll need to leave yourself open to occasional misadventures getting lost or wandering and relying on local advice and assistance,decide where you d like to travel while the idea of showing up at an airport and buying a ticket on the spot may sound fun it s unrealistic and likely quite expensive decide if you want to travel domestically or abroad and then pick a city series of cities or region that you d like to visit at this point you should also consider your financial situation how long can you afford to travel for international travel generally costs more than domestic although frugal decisions while abroad can save substantial money 1 x research source for example if you re interested in touring the american northwest you could spend a full week in a large city like seattle or you could divide your time between several cities like seattle tacoma and portland if you re traveling abroad you may need to obtain a travel visa for the country you re visiting these can take some time to obtain contact the state department of the country you re planning to visit to find out if you need a travel visa and how to apply for this document decide if you re traveling alone or with others spontaneous travel can be successful and fun whether or not you re part of a group or a pair but solo travelers typically need to be more mindful of their own safety if you re traveling alone make sure to book a hotel with a 24 hour front desk so you can check in late and stay in open public places at night it s also smart to regularly keep in touch with a friend or family member at home who knows your travel itinerary 2 x research source whether you re traveling with a group or alone avoid wearing flashy jewelry or clothing and each member of your party should carry more than one form of official identification e g a passport and a driver s license choose lodging in a central location staying in the middle of a city or region will give you access to plenty of cultural and local events and places like theaters concert venues restaurants and bars museums and other places to visit once you ve unpacked your bags in a town plan to stay a few days you can leave your schedule open and spontaneously visit areas of interest if you decide to move between several cities or regions on your trip try to set yourself up in a central location in each successive destination 3 x research source if you were to stay on the outskirts of a city in a rural area or in a small town for example it would be much harder to find locations to spontaneously travel to and visit travel light nothing will slow down a spontaneous trip like copious amounts of luggage unless you have specific reasons for needing to bring many bags for example you re traveling to a very cold climate or need to bring technological equipment with you try to travel with only one bag make sure it s a bag that fits in the overhead compartment of an airplane so you don t have to check bags for a spontaneous last minute flight bring the essential clothing footwear and nothing extraneous 4 x research source having only a single bag will enable you to move quickly from one city or region to another and you ll be able to use any type of transportation that you please plane train renting a car or uber hitchhiking bicycle or just walking plan only one event per day the idea of being in an unfamiliar location and planning nothing may be daunting so approach your spontaneous trip by planning one daily excursion ahead of time and then making two more unplanned things this will allow you to structure the days of your trip without making your schedule feel over planned 5 x research source for example plan on one significant cultural experience per day if you re in rome you may wish to visit the colosseum if you re in paris plan a trip to the louvre after that do something spontaneous that appeals to you sit in a caf√© and watch people passing by visit a local market wander into a nearby museum or take a hike or rafting trip through nature ask a local for their advice if you re having trouble finding an activity in a certain city or region or are simply looking for a travel experience that you wouldn t come by in your native city ask a local for a recommendation locals can let you in on which neighborhoods are worth visiting if a city or region has any hidden gems that won t be known to foreigners or if any popular tourist destinations are not worth the hype 6 x research source for example ask something like i m spending a few days here without a travel itinerary what are some places you d recommend i visit other than big tourist attractions if you re open to any type of spontaneous experience in the region you re traveling ask locals about their favorite outdoors activity weather permitting you ll likely receive recommendations for hiking location but perhaps also fishing swimming bird watching or mountain biking avoid relying on review sites sites such as tripadvisor and yelp can be useful but when you re traveling spontaneously it s best to go without consulting review sites over reliance on these sites will make your trip feel planned and bland and you ll likely find yourself in touristy locations that do not offer much local interest or color 7 x research source avoiding review sites will leave you open to enjoyable surprises as you use your own intuition and the advice of locals to find interesting travel destinations sometimes tourist destinations plant reviews in order to drum up business a high rating may not be entirely legitimate go to touristy sites to scout out more hidden local treasures one benefit of going to a tourist trap is that locals bartenders tour guides waiters hotel staff shopkeepers cab drivers etc expect outsiders and these people are often are great informers to local favorite places look for last minute deals another benefit of spontaneous travel is that your plans can be revised with relatively little notice to accommodate good deals or cheap attractions once or twice a day provided that you have an internet connection you can check websites like groupon or travelzoo to see if there are any attractions in your area this approach can save you money and also present opportunities to attend events you wouldn t have known about otherwise you can also look for last minute bookings at hotels and through travel apps like priceline hoteltonight blink for travel in europe and booking now 8 x research source be open to the unexpected and to changing plans when traveling spontaneously a few minor mishaps are bound to happen you won t find lodging until late at night a restaurant praised by a local will end up being disappointing or a trail you ve decided to hike may be closed seasonally view these frustrating situations as opportunities rather than disappointments 9 x research source for example if a restaurant isn t enjoyable leave and wander through a food heavy district of town until you find a better place to dine if you can t spend the day hiking rent a car and drive through the countryside instead one of the major benefits of spontaneous traveling is that unexpected changes of plans become part of the norm leave yourself open to this and enjoy where the trip takes you being open and flexible also allows for optimizing vacation time a rigid schedule may not allow for spending less time at places that are not of high interest and more time at another enjoy wandering or getting lost plan to spend some of your travel time simply wandering through new regions of a city or rural district this will lead you to interesting local markets shops restaurants and scenic vistas that you likely would not have found if you hadn t wandered spontaneously opening your travel plans to the unexpected will yield unanticipated discoveries and bring a sense of independence 10 x research source if you do end up seriously lost don t panic avoid areas that seem unsafe or feel uncomfortable and use your phone or map to find your way back to your hotel or hostel if you re lost in a town or city you can call a cab or find someone to call a cab for you or book an uber on your phone it s important to consider safety issues when wandering through a foreign city or region if a part of a city makes you feel uncomfortable trust your instinct and leave always have an idea of how far from your hotel or hostel you are by car and avoid getting lost in areas without a phone or internet signal take advantage of local events and festivals you can find out about many of these in local weeklies or weekly newspapers which will contain listings for upcoming concerts shows film screenings or theater performances and other types of local entertainment that you wouldn t find out about otherwise these events will be largely devoid of tourists and so will give your spontaneous travel a more authentic local feel 11 x research source these local events could include large concerts or musical festivals cultural holidays e g day of the dead religious holidays food festivals sporting events or any other number of local events on the other hand large holidays festivals or holiday weekends may increase your travel costs or increase congestion on highways an increase in a city s population say due to a large ongoing music festival will also make hotel and hostel rooms both more scarce and more expensive 12 x research source ask about group travel deals if you re traveling with a group many places including hotels theaters sports stadiums day tours and concert venues may be inclined to offer you a discounted rate since you ll be bringing several paying customers once you re on the ground in a city or region ask around or check the weekly newspaper to see if you can negotiate a group rate for an activity if you plan ahead before you travel you can take advantage of a group hotel discount through a site like hotelplanner or even directly through a hotel website itself,Travel

how to plan a year of travel,spending an entire year traveling is a dream for many people however it requires a lot of preparation don t worry though if you stay organized and give yourself enough time you can make this dream come true start planning a year in advance so you have time to outline and book your trip get all of the documents you need save up for travel expenses and prepare for your big adventure,make a list of places you want to visit a year before your departure date the first step in the planning stage is making a broad list of the countries and areas you d like to visit since planning will take a long time give yourself a year between starting the planning process and your eventual departure date discuss the plan with all of your travel companions and think about the places you ve always wanted to go draw up a master list of locations that you want to visit during the year 1 x research source you may also want to visit multiple cities or sites in a single country account for that as well this list doesn t have to be the final list of your destinations it s more of a brainstorming stage before hammering out more specifics list all of the places you might want to go without limitations yet then work on whittling the list down as you do more planning and see what s possible with your timeline and budget check if any countries on your list have travel advisories unfortunately some places around the world are not safe to travel to some are active warzones some are experiencing epidemics and others are undergoing some form of unrest protect your safety by avoiding areas that have official travel advisories search for any advisories on countries that you re considering visiting if there is a high risk remove those places from your itinerary 2 x research source sometimes only a certain area in a country has an advisory in these cases you may not have to eliminate the whole country from your list just a certain region for a list of countries that the us has announced travel advisories for visit https travel state gov content travel en traveladvisories traveladvisories html if you re not in the us see if your own government has a similar list of restricted countries the us list can still give you a good indication of which areas are unsafe remember that even if a country doesn t have a travel advisory against it traveling is still potentially dangerous always be vigilant and don t put yourself in dangerous situations draw up an itinerary for each location you re visiting when you broadly know what countries and cities you re visiting then look at what you can do in each location make a list of clubs restaurants historical sites museums and any other attractions you want to visit plan out your itinerary so you can make the most of your time in each area 3 x research source remember that you don t have to plan every minute of the trip scheduling some free time to wander and get to know the place is a great way to enjoy your trip even more some activities may require tour guides be sure to book these in advance they could be filled up by the time you get to the destination look up the costs of each activity as well

date to find the best deals and prices book all of them well in advance so all your travel is arranged before the trip 4 x research source if you can t get a direct flight to one of your locations

hostel try calling them many youth hostels will allow minors to stay although most are restricted to those 16 and older book flights most but not all airlines will allow you to travel alone if you are 18 traveling alone is different from traveling as an unaccompanied minor note that unaccompanied minor programs usually for children under the age of 12 are tickets where you are guided from gate to gate by airline staff and must be dropped off and picked up by an adult prepare to go traveling alone can be intimidating but you almost always come back a different person you ll be more self confident and have a different view of both your own culture and the cultures you interact with on your trip you ll have new friends and new memories in a new place enjoy your trip,Travel

the day or at certain points during the vacation with your spouse consider going to resorts where there are kids clubs that have adult supervision while you spent time relaxing with your partner bond

how to get from italy to greece,where you are in italy could be one of the biggest factors in determining the best way to get to greece but cost and time are also big things to think about so let s look at your options for how to get from italy to greece and then you can see which one fits your travel schedule and budget best,take a ferry from italy to greece if you re on the eastern coast of italy and you want to go to greece the first thing you d probably think of is taking a ferry ports in italy that are departure points for greece are bari brindisi ancona and venice but your choices don t end there 1 x research source there are a few different ports in greece that you can sail to and a few different ferry companies you can pick as well here s an outline of the options ferry company names are listed after the greek destinations the prices for ferries are going to vary widely depending on your departure and arrival points the duration of the trip the kind of ticket you buy deck only seat only dorm bed or cabin as well as the company you choose so you ll need to think about your own travel budget not to mention your comfort level in order to pick the ferry that s right for you some ferry companies offer an option called camping on board especially on the longer ferry trips which is designed for people traveling with a camper or motorhome and only available during better weather usually april october this option lets you use the ship s showers bathrooms and electricity for free it just means that you re staying in your camper during the trip rather than taking a seat on the ship upstairs now as for how fast these ferry trips are remember what i said about them being for travelers with time to spare even the company called superfast has to deal with the fact

15 20 investment that can save a lot of headache don t be afraid to rip it up and staple together only the pieces you need a well kept guidebook might make a nice souvenir but it may not be worth the extra weight of carrying around information that you don t need understand the basic customs of the area before going on the trip research what is and is not acceptable in your destination when you arrive observe how others act in person remember some things are okay for locals to do but not for tourists to do learn some basic phrases of the country you are going to this is just polite even if you struggle with it the locals will appreciate that you ve at least tried their language instead of rudely asking do you speak english or whatever your native tongue happens to be if you use the native language to ask for something expect the reply to be in that language and at normal conversational speed which is going to be faster than the audio lessons you learned this is not to say that you shouldn t learn some basic greetings and questions you should however be ready for the responses 2 x research source get a reliable map of the area you are going to memorize it and note each of

of agriculture in the u s make a list a few weeks before the trip the list should include everything you are going to take with you you can put these items into separate columns under what bag they are going in if you don t have everything you need write it down then buy it when you are shopping this way you can prepare everything so you are organised if you are still struggling with what to pack you can find an online rough guide with the essentials and basics when you are all packed take out you passport and any other travelling documents and keep them with you in a separate bag with your purse and phone so it all stays together pack efficiently no matter how you re traveling extra bags and unnecessary things will weigh you down as travel writer rick steves says you can t travel happy heavy and cheap pick two a few classic pieces that are easily mixed and matched and a knowledge of how to use the local laundromat can save you money on overweight baggage fees know the common

how to fly with kids,flying with kids doesn t have to be difficult there are several things you can do before during and after your flight to make the experience positive for your kids yourself and the other passengers on the plane by thinking ahead to how the day is going to go delegating tasks to the traveling adults and providing good information and entertainment for your little ones you can make your next trip with your children the best one yet,choose a night or early morning flight a sleepy kid will be more likely to conk out during the plane ride early morning flights also tend to be less crowded if you re taking an overnight flight and they just can t calm down try quietly reading them a bedtime story that they ve heard before having them listen to calming music or nature sounds or giving them a gentle back and neck massage if you re still having trouble getting them to sleep child doses of melatonin benadryl diphenhydramine cannot be used for children under age 2 or other gentle sleep aids can help if you are unsure about the safety of a sleep aid ask your pediatrician for recommendations and tips 1 x research source check flight costs for children as they can vary by airline airlines sometimes have child fare information on their website if they don t call the airline and ask if you can expect a fee for an infant to sit in your lap whether you should buy another adult seat for your toddler and if your child needs a special safety seat based on their age and size ask the name of the representative who is helping you so that you can reference that information later if necessary bring a stroller or car seat but only if it s absolutely necessary strollers and car seats can be difficult to tote around and are a hassle for connecting flights they could also get damaged in the checked bag cargo hold if you need a stroller call your airline to ask about checking strollers and the related costs 2 x research source check in at least two hours before your flight there s nothing worse than feeling stressed in the line at security because your flight is about to leave and you have little ones to get through security allow 2 3 hours to make it through check in and security stress free arriving early will also let your children explore the airport while they wait which can make for a valuable learning experience and is a great way to tire them out use a child harness if your child tends to wander check your flight status the night before your flight and as you arrive at the airport if there are delays or cancellations you ll want to know as soon as possible so that you can make other arrangements take the time to explain the new plan to your little ones since changes to a big trip can cause meltdowns divide up responsibilities among the adults if you are traveling with multiple adults set up a buddy system it might be helpful to have one adult in charge of all of the paperwork while the other keeps the kids busy your family will know the best roles for everyone to take on make travel arrangements between the airport and your accommodations beforehand trying to bustle to a hotel when you have tired kids and no way to get there can cause unnecessary stress have the itinerary and maps of your destination ready for when you get off the plane hang on to all flight hotel and car reservation confirmation numbers to ease transitions put a help i m lost card in your child s pocket it should have your name address and cell phone info on it in case they get separated from you keep a recent picture of your child on you do not let children out of your sight and instruct them to stay close to you at all times walk them through the major steps of air travel like security and take off for example at security say you ll have to take off your shoes to put them through the scanner but don t worry you ll get them back before take off say the plane is going to go really fast and shake a little but it s okay nothing bad will happen keep them involved during the scary parts by giving them a small but important job to do such as putting item bins on the conveyor belt or turning off the electronics before take off 3 x research source let them pack their own bag kids will like the responsibility of preparing and carrying their own luggage it can also help them feel more confident if they feel nervous about their adventure supervise packing so that everything that your child needs makes it into their bag and don t forget a luggage tag with your name and phone number for each bag dress in lightweight comfortable clothing and slip on shoes minimize the amount of metal in clothing and shoes to save time at security planes can be cold so have the kids wear a jacket or keep one in their bag tell them that ear or tummy pain during the plane ride is only temporary bring earache drops and show them how to pop their ears to minimize ear pain from high altitude if they feel nauseated dramamine or emetrol can help consult with your doctor before using medications that your child has not used before 4 x research source bring a cleanup kit for messes and accidents keep wet wipes napkins hand sanitizer bandages sick bags and pull ups in your carry on don t rely on the flight attendants to take care of your child s mishaps as they have many other passengers to attend to seat your child away from the aisle little hands and feet can get hurt from passing passengers or the food and beverage cart and children should not be grabbing at people or property make your child comfortable it s hard to sit still for so long but a couple of small pillows a blanket and a stuffed animal can make all the difference a comfy kid will also be less likely to want to leave their seat or kick the backs of others seats provide a variety of entertainment feel free to use the in flight options but don t depend on them since their favorite game or show might not be available bring a portable game console a phone loaded with music and audiobooks stickers playing cards puzzle books blank paper and pencils for more educational activities have them plan a vacation using travel pamphlets or review your itinerary again introduce books flashcards and other learning materials suitable for your child s age if you have school age children ask their teacher what he or she suggests pack a small surprise gift for them such as a new coloring book and crayons this will help pique their interest in a new activity and fight off boredom bring lots of snacks infants only require breast milk or formula and make sure you have bottled water if you need to mix formula on the plane for older kids provide low sugar options such as cereal puff snacks plain pasta sandwiches granola bars dried fruit and snack pouches avoid items that need refrigeration melty or crumbly foods and bananas and avocados as they turn into brown mush in a bag 5 x research source there are rules about the amount and type of liquids or gels that can be carried past security but exceptions are sometimes made for bottles juice boxes and sippy cups 6 x trustworthy source u s transportation security administration u s government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols go to source make sure that you mention these items to the tsa agent before going through security and that

how to be a traveler and not a tourist,unlike a tourist a traveler is someone who wants to experience another culture and avoid tourist traps and other less authentic experience to embrace the

foot sometimes dressing to fit in can become a safety concern research your travel destination and pack appropriately make sure you re respecting a country s culture or widespread religious beliefs with the clothing you wear there 3 x research source minimize your chances of danger by wearing appropriate clothing that won t make it obvious you are a tourist if you re visiting a country where people dress modestly or formally avoid wearing tank tops and flip flops if you re in a country with strong religious beliefs avoid wearing symbols that may offend its citizens for instance if you are traveling in thailand don t wear clothing that depicts the buddha if you have a tattoo of the buddha cover it skip the big city hotel opt for bed and breakfast options or small countryside hotels these smaller scale options are often more personalized and authentic ask the hotel owner or manager what they would do with a day off and experience a day in the life of a local try renting an airbnb or couchsurfing for an even closer connection to the local culture don t do things just because they re a city s must see there will inevitably be a must see or must do item in any city or country you

pick up a bike on one side of the city and drop it off elsewhere check if your travel destination has this option if you re going somewhere more rural locate local bike shops that might sell bikes ask locals or your hotel concierge where you might find one of these stores always makes sure you bring the right hiking supplies before any excursion and plan on being back in civilization at least an hour before sundown use public transportation instead while it can be tempting to taxi everywhere using public transportation ensures you feel the ebb and flow of a city s culture walk take the bus or

for travelers say yes if you run into misfortune on the road or if you make a new friend that s local to the area they might invite you to do something with them it can be as simple as dinner or as complex as travelling somewhere else but if the offer sounds exciting say yes not only will this give you a more authentic experience but you might just stumble upon the trip of your life 9 x research

with raised prices if you try to purchase a ticket day of note that some countries require an international driver s license before you can rent a car 14 x research source stay away from highways highways are a great way to get where you need to go fast but you can learn so much more about the lay of the land the geography of the place you re visiting and about local life if you stick to small roads ask for advice and directions and don t be afraid to get lost sometimes the best discoveries are the unexpected ones 15 x research source,Travel

directions by saying you re meeting a friend if someone asks you where you re staying at night let them know that you aren t sure yet you re just exploring being a good traveler doesn t mean exposing yourself unnecessarily to danger while there are always exceptions in general don t tell people where you re sleeping don t tell people you re traveling alone don t broadcast your status as a

you call when you say you ll call or email to let them know you re okay if you write a travel blog update it briefly even when you don t have time for a full post there will be people back home worrying that you re hurt or in trouble if you drop off the face of the earth without warning in the rare worst case scenario that something happens to you time is of the essence have someone with a plan to help you if something goes wrong take time every day to journal or write down your thoughts traveling is a whirlwind and it is easy to get swept up in the excitement find a way to make your memories permanent by taking some time to write them down even jotting down a list of the things you did will help you remember the stories events and locations that made your trip memorable many solo travelers find that writing a travel blog a great way to connect deeply with their vacation and keep friends and family back home in the loop just start moving following your instincts walk to the big attraction instead of taking a taxi rent a bike and go exploring on the city streets take a trail that your fellow hostel mates are about to hike traveling alone gives you the freedom to explore now and make plans later get on the ground then and start exploring you ll never know who or what you ll find if you re the type that likes organization and firm plans hop onto a tour group ask the hotel

own two feet 9 x research source make a few friends they can be fellow hostelers a ranger at the campground or the bartender at your nearest pub a friendly smile and hello is usually all you need to

find no better guidebooks than the people who live and work in the place every day being alone means it is easy to pick up and drop plans keep your ears open for events at your hostel or hotel or any parties or group activities with other travelers a deck of cards is a great way to break the ice push yourself to try new things travel is perhaps the best time to expand your horizons so don t cut yourself short by acting picky dive into a local dish you wouldn t otherwise order go see a local concert in a genre you ve never heard before hike to the top of a mountain in your flip flops whatever it is that interest you even a little is worth exploring at the very least it almost always ends in a great story 10 x research source remember that there is no right way to travel bask in the freedom of solo traveling do what you want to do see the people and sights you want to see and keep moving if you wake up one day and decide you want to read by the pool all afternoon instead of seeing the museums do it traveling alone means the experiences are all yours allowing you to find the right trip for you so use the guidebooks as guides not the law and stay flexible with the right attitude and

everybody and even delegate some of the research to family members early decision making is really important if you want to get your first choice at a reasonable price choose the type of accommodation some sample ideas for get together venues are villa vacation rental getting one big house with one big kitchen living room is a great way to spend quality time with the family there s nothing like being able to stroll into the living room to watch a late night movie with whoever is staying up conversations need not be interrupted prematurely and plus there s always a central base that is the hub of activity sharing the cost of this type of accommodation is practical and cost effective too cruise the ultimate in convenience you don t have to worry about food and you unpack only once make sure you get cabins reasonably near each other or else you risk spreading the hub of activity tours some tour companies can customize a tour for your family if you have a minimum number of people in your group many view tours as a great way to learn more about a place while others may view tours as being too restrictive hotels resorts suites are a great way to pack more people together and to save on costs for large get togethers though it can be somewhat impersonal because hotel rooms are too small to accommodate everybody for a chat or to play a game and so you end up with dispersed mini groups within the get together if you have to book multiple hotel rooms try to get them all in one wing or even suites that connect if possible look for group discounts too depending upon the size of your group you may qualify family member s house choosing one family member s house to congregate at is definitely the cheapest option you never have to worry about picking the right restaurant and stocking up is easy to do there are other options such as working ranches farms disneyland disney world rv houseboat camping renting and taking that trip around america on amtrak the key is to get the commitment first as soon as you agree start booking once people are committed meaningful planning goes a lot faster and easier organize the basics online with google docs you could do this via email but you will be inundated with a myriad of emails that will add even greater confusion one source that you may find useful is to use a group website such as pbwiki where family members can add their own information have everyone put their flights on a group calendar this makes it easier to coordinate airport pickups and car rental configurations put local resources and maps on the group site so that everyone will have the latest and greatest information place everyone s email addresses phone and or cell numbers on both your cell phone and computer for quick communications add any other important information such as immunizations passports temperature and weather patterns and provide that information to all family members consider booking a few restaurant reservations before your trip if you have a large group trying to find a decent restaurant last minute that can accommodate a large party may be impossible make an online shopping list and have all family members add things that they would like to eat snack beach toys etc think about setting up a department store run as your first order of business when you get there so you can stock up on the things you need early don t be a control freak nothing can sap the fun out of a vacation than somebody who can t roll with the punches and especially for the person who is organizing or helping to organize the vacation no vacation works out exactly as you plan remember that you are having a vacation and that means having fun not making sure everything on the planned itinerary is checked off only plan at most two activities in a day getting so many people coordinated is difficult already and any transitions between activities takes more time than you think somebody always wants to visit that gift shop for a little bit extra time or to take that side diversion and you have to be able to accommodate for that plan 2 activities a day the purpose of a family vacation is to have family spend time with each other and especially to engage with each other in conversation a couple of ideas to make sure you include everybody and increase those memorable moments cook meals together it s certainly cheaper to eat inside but the bigger benefit is that you get people working together in the kitchen talking and there s nothing like being able to share your food repertoire with your family members you can also put together a sign up sheet so family members can take turns for cooking duty board games many families avoid tv watching and video games while on vacation and playing games like chess or checkers can be a fun way for family members to talk with each other outdoor fun this is especially important during vacations because it gives families the opportunity to do things they don t usually have time to do on a regular basis whether it s golf swimming tennis or even yoga it gives your family members a chance to relax and have fun deal with different money situations early some family members may want to split costs while others may want to pay for everything themselves there s also preferences for either spending money on everything separately or together in one payment you need to talk to all of your family members individually and take notes on a notepad on how they want to spend their own money you can also put together a spreadsheet with everyone s names on them and have them fill it out with their own preferences start talking about the next vacation you can t beat face to face communication spend a little time on the last day of your vacation talking about what you want to do for the next vacation you can get a lot done talking about it in person in a group versus over email or over the phone and plus you ll be fresh with the knowledge of what worked well and what didn t keep the vacation spirit alive make sure everyone gets home safely by sending an email calling them on the phone do some photo sharing and if you are enterprising put together a photo album using services like http www shutterfly com and http www blurb com so that you can always remember the good times all of you had together as a family,Travel
how to avoid bed bugs when traveling,imagine finally finding time to take a much needed vacation then when you return home relaxed and feeling rejuvenated you discover you now have a bed bug problem it is no surprise that traveling is one of the easiest ways to bring the unwelcome pests into your home while traveling there are several precautions you should take to keep this nightmare from happening,investigate hotels prior to booking a hotel research multiple options and read reviews customer comments there are dozens of sites that offer hotel feedback so take advantage of these resources keep in mind that negative comments may simply be an unhappy guest who just wants to ruin the hotel s reputation however if you see several comments around the same topic like bed bugs consider it a legitimate concern call the hotel directly don t hesitate to ask if they have ever had any issues in the past and what preventative measures they take to prevent bed bugs if they can t answer your questions scratch them from your list of hotel options consider other options if you re traveling to a location where you know someone think about staying with them instead of a traditional hotel crashing with a friend or family member will alleviate some stress and may be more enjoyable enjoy the outdoors head to the nearest camp ground and sleep under the stars or in a cozy tent many camps are extremely clean and offer hot showers for very reasonable rates inspect the mattresses if you can t get around a hotel stay and are concerned about the itchy critters inspect the your room for any signs of bed bugs you shouldn t need any special tools to do this remove the sheet and mattress pad to inspect the four corners of the mattress and box spring bugs are brown with a long oval shaped body most are tiny about the size of an apple seed but they can be larger about the size of a nickel you should also look for black fecal matter and a musty smell 1 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source inspect the furniture all furniture around the bed will need to be checked this includes the headboard nightstands and any pictures on the wall these bugs can hide behind all of these items 2 x research source keep luggage off the floor during your stay use the provided luggage racks after they ve been inspected for bugs of course bugs can hide in the small crevices and climb right into your bag place the luggage rack away from any furniture if the closet is large enough keep it in there hang your clothes folding them and placing in drawers is an unnecessary risk by hanging them you significantly reduce your chances of having one or a few crawl into a shirt collar before wearing any garment shake it out as an extra precaution take a large plastic bag store your dirty clothes in a bag as bed bugs can smell and are attracted to the chemical that we leave behind on our clothing if you forget ask the hotel to supply something like an extra trash bag alert the hotel if you suspect your room has a bed bug problem let the staff know immediately ask to be moved to another room as soon as possible do not move to an adjacent room request a move to another floor inspect your luggage before entering your home check the outside of your bags for any bed bug evidence like small eggs a faint smell etc if you suspect you brought a few home with you leave the bags in the garage or backyard do not take them inside if your luggage is a dark color it may be difficult to see use a lint roller covering the entire bag seams and zippers 3 x research source unpack and wash while you typically may unpack and throw your clothes onto the floor or into a hamper this could spread any bugs you brought back with you instead unpack and place your items directly into a washing machine or in a sealed bag until they can be laundered don t hang dry your clothes either tossing items into a scorching hot dryer will kill the bugs even items that weren t worn should be washed bugs could have crawled throughout the bag better to be safe than sorry shoes can be wiped down with a cloth and some hot water leave them outside in the sunlight if possible for a couple of hours too clean bags after unpacking vacuum all pieces of luggage inside and out immediately remove the collected debris seal it and place it outside you can also place suitcases in sealed plastic bags and store them away from your bedroom such as in the basement or garage never store suitcases under your bed look for bites if you are itching or have red bumps on your legs you may have a case of bed bugs it may take you a while to discover what the problem is and by that time you could have a full outbreak 4 x research source confirm your suspicions by visiting a doctor they will have solutions for clearing any sores contact a professional to discuss the extermination options available to you they may recommend chemical or steam treatments 5 x research source research pesticides but be clear on their use while some are great for indoors others can only be used outside 6 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source,Travel

how to suggest your relatives stay in a hotel rather than your home,when you ve got family coming in for a visit telling them to find another place to stay can seem like wishful thinking but if you just can t face the prospect of putting up with your demanding relatives for days on end there are ways to handle the situation with tact the first thing you ll want to do is be up front about the fact that your abode is off limits after that you can smooth things out by helping them make other arrangements financing their accommodations and making sure they enjoy the time you spend together,let them know up front prime your visitors expectations by being explicit about the fact that you don t have the room or resources to play host that way they ll have plenty of time to make other arrangements the news may be disappointing but it s more considerate than letting them find out only after they show up on your doorstep 1 x research source try cushioning the blow with a caveat as much as we d love to have you at the house we ve just got too much going on this weekend don t mince words or beat around the bush trying to avoid the topic this will only come as more of a blow when you finally break the news 2 x research source drop hints that your home is unavailable if you just don t have the heart to refuse your relatives outright you can take the less direct route when they first call or write to inform you of their visit innocently ask them where they plan on staying or mention how much work you have to do around your place with any luck they ll get the message without it becoming an issue 3 x research source you could also try leaving things vague by saying something like it s too bad there s no a way for us all to stay together be ready to give them a good reason obviously it won t do to tell your overbearing in laws that you just don t want them around have an explanation lined up for why your home isn t the best option it should be something believable and ideally at least partially true so that they ll be more accepting of your circumstances 4 x research source perhaps you re busy taking care of a newborn or you re in the process of remodeling your only guest room avoid lying outright not only is it dishonest but there s a good chance that the truth could come out later if someone were to stop by act unprepared if your family surprises you with a visit it s okay to tell them that you re simply not in a position to receive company they might even be anticipating this response since they decided to make the trip on little or no notice in this scenario they ll more than likely already have a backup plan in place which means you ll be off the hook explain to unexpected guests you have too much going on to show them the attention they deserve stay one step ahead by recommending a nearby hotel before they ask to stay with you choose your words carefully someone less understanding might take offense if they feel like you re trying to wash your hands of them let them down as easily as possible emphasize that your request is being made out of necessity rather than preference you don t want it to sound like your reasons are personal in any way 5 x research source try to broadcast genuine sympathy and regret in your tone chances are your family knows you better than almost anyone so they ll be able to see right through a flimsy apology 6 x research source never make someone feel unwelcome because of their personality or behavior make sure they enjoy their stay the last thing you want is for your family to be in a sour mood after going out of their way to come see you once everyone has arrived and gotten situated go out of your way to see that they have a good time show them fun things to do around town share meals together and catch up on the details of everyone s lives make them feel like honored guests not like an unwanted nuisance 7 x research source even if the visit isn t going well remember that it s only temporary and try to power through with a positive attitude 8 x research source successfully talking your relatives into getting their own room shouldn t be used as an excuse to ignore or neglect them if anything you should be more eager please since they won t be around as often don t invite them in the first place in the end there may be nothing you can do to prevent an awkward misunderstanding if you fear that your reluctance might cause conflict it may be best not to put either of you in the hot seat consider coming to them instead or finding a more neutral way to get together like a family vacation or reunion dinner somewhere public reschedule the visit for a date that s more convenient for you if nothing else this will give you more time to mentally prepare there may be times when you just have to bite the bullet and make the most of it after all family comes first 9 x research source help them find another place to stay hunt down hotels in your area and find a few that look clean safe and comfortable make sure the place you select is close enough to your home to allow you to easily meet up compile a list of potential options that you can recommend later 10 x research source try to find a place that s centrally located and surrounded by essential conveniences like restaurants banks gas stations and supermarkets browse private condos and airbnb rentals as well these tend to be more homey and inviting than the average hotel 11 x research source ask someone else to put them up call a sibling cousin or in law you re on good terms with and see if they d be willing to open their homes to your mutual relations bring up pressing concerns like space noise or privacy as a way of selling your suggestion if they agree it will be a win win family will take in family and you ll be in the clear 12 x research source work out an agreement to alternate hosting duties in the future 13 x research source offer to pay for their accommodations depending on the size of the party you might be able to get everyone squared away on your own dime sponsoring your relatives stay will ease some of the financial burden of their travels it may also help defuse any resentment they may feel toward you for turning them away surprising your visitors with free lodging is a good way to make up for you asking them to stay somewhere else helping with the cost of your family s trip can also serve as a kind of unspoken apology since we couldn t make it work at the house this one s on me,Travel

you ll have much better odds of surviving a shipwreck with some hard work and luck you ll survive this stressful ordeal,stay calm perhaps the most important thing to surviving a shipwreck is staying calm this is even more important in the first chaotic moments in a tragedy at sea if you don t stay calm you could put yourself in more risk 1 x trustworthy source federal emergency management agency federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency go to source if you find yourself panicking tell yourself to relax and breathe deeply think before you act don t just run to the first life boat or jump into the water at the first sight of danger consider all your options find a flotation device as the craft you re on is sinking you should make it your primary goal to find some sort of flotation device without a flotation device you probably won t survive for very long in the water some devices include life preservers solid life boats inflatable rafts 2 x research source jump from the craft if you are in danger if you must jump from a boat make sure to keep your shoes on look down before you jump to make sure you don t land on other people or objects place one of your arms on your abdomen then grasp your opposite elbow use the opposite hand to hold your nose closed finally jump as far off as you can as you fall cross your legs and try to enter the water with your feet first 3 x research source get away from the boat if it is large large ships tend to create a suction effect and suck things down with them as they sink as a result the larger the vessel the farther you should get away from it as it sinks this is important as large boats can bring you down even if you re wearing a life preserver 4 x research source use the breaststroke to swim away from the boat kick strongly with your legs if you don t know how to swim very well stay calm tread water and slowly paddle away from the sinking ship find something to help you stay afloat if you don t have a life preserver raft or something else to float on look around the area of the shipwreck for any debris you could use to stay afloat there are many possible items that you could use such as a door pieces of the boat that are still floating spare lifeboats or life preservers that aren t being used look to see if you are injured after you re a safe distance from the boat you should take a quick look at yourself to see if you re injured or not this is important as you could need immediate medical attention pay attention to whether you re bleeding if so and the wound is bad you may need to use a tourniquet to stop loss of blood this is important as blood loss could fasten the pace at which hypothermia sets in you have a broken limb a broken limb could seriously inhibit your ability to swim if you have one you ll need to immediately ask for the assistance of another survivor help others after you ve checked yourself and found a way to keep yourself afloat see if you can offer assistance to other survivors who may need help other survivors could be in serious distress and need immediate help 5 x research source assist others who may be in shock talk to them tell them things will be okay and let them know you are there to help them treat people who have concussions organize your group after you ve adjusted to your new status you need to talk to everyone in your group and get them organized survivors in your group may have knowledge expertise or ideas about how to increase your survival chances and get rescued 6 x research source stay together your chances of surviving and being rescued are a lot higher if your group is organized and stays together look for supplies after you and other survivors have found a way to stay afloat start organizing and gathering supplies ultimately the more supplies you have and the better you manage them the longer you ll be able to survive until you are rescued pay special attention to fresh water store and ration your fresh water as well as you can food signal flares and other items you could signal rescuers with avoid hypothermia next to drowning hypothermia is the biggest threat to your survivor after a shipwreck this is because exposure to cold water will lower your body temperature if your body temperature gets too low your body will eventually shut down and you will die if you re in the water with a flotation device and not on a raft hug your knees to your chest this will help maintain body warmth if you re with others in the water or in a raft stay close together and hug each other keep your clothes on even if they re soaked they ll help maintain your body temperature 7 x research source watch for sharks next to hyperthermia and drowning one of the biggest dangers on the open water are sharks sharks are especially dangerous around shipwrecks because they re attracted to blood from injured people and by the fish that gather around floating objects on the surface

so pick a city or country that looks appealing to you for example if you aren t a big beach person aruba probably isn t the best spot for a dream vacation 3 x research source if you really love visiting cities and going out on the town pick a major city if you re a fan of the beach pick a tropical island or coastal town there are hundreds of options when it comes to finding great destinations for bicycling fanatics foodies and art lovers alike if you re big on nightlife pick a destination famous for its clubs and breweries like amsterdam or budapest if you re a big hiker ireland sweden and switzerland are quite famous you can t go wrong with a major city known for its food if you love to eat like new york chicago paris or tokyo unless there s a destination you re completely obsessed with it s probably better to visit a place you ve never been if you re looking for the best vacation ever you re more likely to have memorable experiences if you aren t comparing your trip with other trips you ve been on 4 x research source you don t have to go out of the country to have an incredible vacation think about visiting a new city or region in your home country travel to 2 3 locations near one another if you love seeing new things if you re planning a longer trip consider stopping in 2 3 destinations that are relatively close to one another especially if you re traveling far from home and may not get back to the corner of the world anytime soon pick a few destinations that offer unique sights and amenities to really get the best experience possible 5 x research source there s nothing wrong with staying in one place for the duration of your vacation if you ve been dreaming of visiting south africa your entire life why bother stopping at morocco madagascar or botswana island hopping is a great way to experience different parts of the world for example the volcanic big island in hawaii is a lot different from the big cities on oahu consider travelling to multiple cities in different countries this is a great option if you re going to europe since the trains and eu regulations make it easy to go from prague to berlin to paris for example avoid choosing destinations that are incredibly similar if you can for example you re probably going to see a lot of mountains in colorado maybe taking that short flight to portland won t seem quite as interesting after 2 3 days of hiking and craft beer in denver schedule your trip a little outside of the busy season if possible you may get frustrated if you visit during peak season and every tourist site is packed with other travelers however you may miss out on things if places close during the off season or the weather isn t great optimally pick dates for your trip that are 1 2 months outside of the super busy season 6 x research source for example italy gets the most tourists from june to august if you re planning on checking rome out april may and september are ideal times to visit the main exception to this is if you re planning a beach vacation where the weather really matters for example it may drop to 45 55 f 7 13 c in los angeles when it s december you don t need to worry about this if you re visiting a place a little off of the beaten path even during the peak tourist season places like mongolia peru and berlin don t get huge influxes of tourists plan to spend 6 8 days on your vacation to take the ideal trip trips shorter than 6 days are likely going to feel too short and you may feel like you missed out on a lot of stuff if you re staying 9 days or more you re very likely to get bored of the location or feel like going home early the sweet spot for vacations is between 6 8 days so select your dates accordingly 7 x research source if you re travelling with your family pick one thing you really want to do or see and plan to do it alone let your family or friends know ahead of time what you plan on doing this will give you a special little experience for you to hold on to and it s a great way to sneak in something that isn t kid friendly if you re travelling with your family for maximum enjoyment pick your dates to give yourself a 1 day buffer at home when you return for example if you work monday through friday plan to return on saturday night or sunday morning pick a fun place to stay and spend a little extra on lodging booking a cheap hotel is typically the best way to save some money when you travel but booking a nice place to stay is the best way to upgrade your vacation if you can afford it look for higher end hotels or resorts where you re really going to feel like you re living in luxury 8 x research source look at high end bed and breakfasts as well there s some really nice stuff out there if you can stretch your budget a little choose a handful of activities and sites that really appeal to you choose 4 5 key sites and activities that sound really fun to you and book tickets in advance if you need them spread your activities out so that you don t pack too much into any single day if you plan 3 4 activities into every day you re going to stress yourself out and wear yourself down if you don t plan anything though you re likely to miss out on something fun 9 x research source if you love great food find some famous restaurants with unique regional cuisine if you re into the great outdoors look up the best hiking routes in the area the activities you choose depend on where you re going and what you re interested in you can take tours rent bikes go hang out at the beach or visit a famous site there are no right or wrong answers here so choose activities that sound fun to you don t overload your trip with too many sights or too much travelling the easiest way to keep your vacation from being the best is to push yourself too hard to pack everything into your trip you aren t going to have fun if you try and do as much as you possibly can while you re visiting a new location it s impossible to do everything and you re only going to stress yourself out on your trip if you try to do too much 10 x research source the pressure you put on yourself to have the best vacation ever can ironically keep you from having the best vacation ever take a few hours after you arrive to relax and rest once you get to your destination you re likely going to be a little wiped when you get to the hotel take 4 8 hours to sleep shower relax or have a drink at a nearby bar if you land and start running around immediately you re going to wear yourself down it s better to relax for a little and start fresh after you ve replenished yourself a little 11 x research source you can probably skip this if you re only travelling 1 2 hours to get to your destination confirm your transportation for each day to keep things running smoothly when you re having your morning coffee or taking the first walk of the day make a quick call to any drivers you have scheduled to take you around double check that train map or look up the cost of a taxi to confirm the price if you get on the wrong bus or blow all of your spending cash on taxis you may end up annoyed or missing out on something you were really looking forward to 12 x research source if you are traveling in a major city known for its easy public transit like paris or chicago go ahead and take it it s probably not a great idea to mess around with confusing transit systems though for example it can be pretty hard to navigate buses in india and tokyo s trains can get pretty complicated 13 x research source spend at least one day doing something interesting on your own if you re travelling with others pick one activity or day to do something unique by yourself pick something only you are interested in or simply spend a few hours walking around the city or tourist spots on your own this will give you something memorable to hang on to and ensure that you get to do something you personally enjoy 14 x research source for example if you re travelling with your children and partner set aside 3 4 hours to go check out a famous tavern or visit a site that the rest of your family won t find interesting socialize with locals whenever you get the opportunity this may not be possible if you don t speak the language but if you can communicate with locals chat them up whenever you can this will really make you feel like you re experiencing something new and they may tip you off to a site restaurant or activity that only the locals know about 15 x research source taxi drivers tour guides servers and the folks hanging out at a caf√© or bar are usually more than happy to share their insights or give recommendations to travelers live in the moment and embrace new things to have the most fun regardless of where you are or what you re doing focus on being present breathe in the air enjoy looking around and don t worry about anything going on at home or work be open to trying new foods drinks and meeting new people the more distracted you are the less likely it is that you ll remember this vacation as the best of your life 16 x research source unless you have a tour or something don t worry about the clock paying way too much attention to the time will keep your brain focused on the schedule not the experience deviate from your plans if something more interesting pops up don t stick to the guidebooks and itinerary if you stumble on something that catches your eye if there s a cool restaurant a hidden beach or a zip lining spot the locals keep talking about ditch your plans not only will this mindset give your vacation a sense of freedom and adventure but it ll also give you the chance to experience something new and unexpected 17 x research source keep the pressure off and allow yourself to relax or skip things allow yourself to change or cancel your plans if it starts to feel like you re running all over the place it s much better to stay relaxed and peaceful and you aren t going to have fond memories of the vacation if you wear yourself thin 18 x research source if you finish up a tour and you re totally wiped out go ahead and skip the museum visit you have scheduled an hour from now if you find yourself getting sleepy on the beach take that nap minimize the amount of time you spend on your computer or phone if you brought your laptop avoid using it for anything other than some casual web surfing every once in a while keep your phone in your pocket unless you re taking a photo to avoid getting swept up in something going on at work or home this will limit distractions and ensure that you fully experience everything your destination has to offer 19 x research source choose something really fun to do on the day before you leave if you end with something really awesome you re going to go home feeling energized and you re more likely to remember the vacation fondly save the activity you re most looking forward to for the day before you plan on flying out or driving home 20 x research source this will also give you something to look forward to while you re enjoying the other parts of your trip if you re a huge foodie and you go to that famous restaurant on the first day of your vacation you may spend the next 5 6 days wishing you could go back and enjoy that meal all over again spend the 12 hours before your flight relaxing and resting avoid doing anything exhausting or overly stimulating in the 12 hours leading up to your flight instead take your time to pack enjoy a meal at the hotel or hang out on a balcony if you end up rushing or running around before you leave you re going to come home stressed 21 x research source treat the trip home like it is part of your vacation if you re flying go ahead and order that extra drink upgrade your seats if you can and snatch that window seat if the flight isn t full if you re driving take frequent breaks stop at a tourist spot on the way home and treat yourself to something better than fast food when you stop for a meal 22 x research source this will really make your vacation feel like it isn t over and ensure that you come home happy and refreshed set aside one extra day of relaxation after you land travelling can take a toll on you even if you re having fun while you re doing it sleep in a little make yourself some delicious food and spend the next day doing something relaxing this will give you time to recharge and get you ready to reenter the normal swing of things 23 x research source feel free to catch up on some work emails if you have hundreds of them waiting for you just don t overdo it by spending more than 2 3 hours working on a day you set aside for yourself create a photo album to remember your trip fondly your trip will be more memorable if you compile an actual photo album for the trip this will give you a way to share your experience and really commit everything you did to memory 24 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national

how to use a travel pillow,a good travel pillow can make a world of difference on long trips ideally the pillow will provide support for your neck or body so that you can sleep in a relaxed position even on cramped uncomfortable plane rides choose a pillow that suits your sleeping style and try different positions to find where you are most comfortable,try your neck pillow before buying it neck pillows don t typically come in different sizes so the only way to know if it will fit comfortably is to try it on if possible put your neck pillow on before you buy it or keep the receipt and try it on before your trip you should be able to rest your head on it without bending your neck uncomfortably and the material shouldn t pinch or chafe on your neck 1 x research source inflate your pillow if necessary inflatable travel pillows can be a convenient way to save space when traveling if yours is inflatable blow into the air tube until the pillow is round and firm seal the air tube once you re done by replacing the cap 2 x research source some inflatable pillows self inflate typically this involves turning a valve which will then cause the pillow to slowly inflate but check your pillow s instructions to see how yours inflates 3 x research source non inflatable travel pillows are typically filled with foam or microbeads while they are less convenient for packing you may find that they are more comfortable cover your pillow in a t shirt or scarf to make it softer some neck pillows particularly the less expensive inflatable ones are made of plastic and may not have a very comfortable surface use a thin soft piece of clothing like a t shirt or light scarf to cover your pillow and make it more comfortable you can also buy a removable cover for your pillow just make sure it fits your pillow before buying it place the pillow around your neck most neck pillows are u shaped and will fit around the back of your neck with the opening over your throat some have straps that cross the opening to keep it in place 4 x research source if your pillow is not u shaped it may be designed to fit between your shoulder and head this type limits which direction you can rest your head in so it s best for sleepers who don t change position much recline your seat most neck pillows are designed to support your head as it falls back or to the side this position can be more comfortable if your back is slightly reclined gently recline your seat being careful not to move the seat too quickly or too far towards the passengers behind you until you can lean back comfortably 5 x research source cover your eyes even on nighttime flights the plane is likely to be full of small electronic lights that can make it difficult to sleep eye masks are relatively inexpensive and often sold at drugstores and beauty shops some travel pillows such as the gosleep come with an eye mask you can also improvise one by putting a t shirt or hoodie over your head for more comfortable sleeping 6 x research source rotate the pillow for different sleeping positions if you have a u shaped pillow try turning it around so that it supports your chin as your head falls forward if you have a pillow that fits on your shoulder try switching shoulders to find the most comfortable position 7 x research source place the pillow on the tray table if you want to lean forward to sleep if you tend to sleep on your stomach you may find it more natural to lean forward instead of reclining try putting your travel pillow on your tray table and resting your head on top of it 8 x research source u shaped pillows are ideal for this since they provide a space to put your face while resting your forehead directly on the pillow otherwise you will have to turn your face to the side which may become uncomfortable after long periods travel light to save more space for your pillow body pillows tend to take up more space than neck pillows even when they deflate the more room you have in your suitcase and your seat the more comfortable you will be with a body pillow 9 x research source body pillows range in size but some may be as long and wide as your torso wear loose clothing for comfort body pillows often work best when they are propped against your legs or shoulders wear loose comfortable clothing to avoid too much pressure or compression on your body when using the pillow if you tend to run hot dress light so the body pillow won t cause you to overheat 10 x research source inflate your pillow if necessary some body pillows inflate and deflate for easy storage you may have to inflate the pillow by blowing into it or it may self inflate with the push of a button look on your pillow s packaging or label for instructions on inflating it if you find that the pillow is too firm for comfort once inflated you can deflate it slightly to create a softer surface if you are not worried about space you may prefer a body pillow that is not inflatable such as one filled with foam or microbeads attach the pillow to your seat or seatbelt if possible some body pillows like the travelrest attach to your seatbelt while others like the facecradle may connect to the seat behind or in front of you keep your most comfortable sleeping position in mind when you choose a style if your pillow attaches to the seatbelt move it up to where you can comfortably lean your head against it if the pillow attaches to the back of your seat position it so that you can lead forward at a comfortable angle and rest your head against the pillow lean forward or sideways onto your pillow most body pillows are designed for leaning forward or to the side to let the pillow support your weight find a position that is comfortable for you and leaves your neck as straight as possible 11 x research source your body pillow may have a j shaped curve on each end the larger curve will fit over your shoulder and the smaller curve can be tucked under your opposite arm to help keep it in place some body pillows are designed to rest on your lap or tray table and support your upper body while you lean forward,Travel

flying on a small plane that just simply doesn t have room onboard for your guitar,book a seat at the back of the plane in order to board first people at the back of the plane usually get to board

flight and ask if there is any extra room in a closet to store it upright 3 x research source you can also try this option if there s no overhead room when you re boarding your flight and the gate attendants are telling you that you can t take your guitar on keep in mind that flight attendants are not required to store your guitar in a closet so if they do so they re doing you a kind favor don t fight with the flight attendants if they won t put it in a closet for you you won t achieve anything this way place your guitar carefully into an overhead bin if you can t put it in a closet head to your seat and put your guitar horizontally into the closest available overhead bin place it on top of other passengers overhead luggage if the bins are already filling up and keep an eye out to make sure nobody puts anything on top of it 4 x research source if you re having trouble fitting your guitar into partially filled luggage bins politely ask nearby passengers if you can accommodate their luggage differently in order to fit your guitar in buy a ticket for your guitar if you can t take it as carry on luggage purchase an additional ticket for an adjacent seat and take your guitar on the plane as if it s a person in the seat next to you this is the only way you re allowed to take a large guitar on a plane with you that is too big to fit in an overhead bin 5 x research source if you aren t sure whether your guitar will fit in an overhead bin this is the safest way to avoid problems when you re boarding the flight naturally this isn t always going to be realistic especially if your flight is expensive other options you can consider are getting a smaller cheaper guitar just for travel or shipping your guitar to your destination use a soft case to make your guitar fit into cabin storage more easily place your guitar in a soft gig style case to minimize its footprint for travel these types of cases don t usually add a lot of bulk so your guitar will still be able to fit into an overhead bin 6 x research source these types of cases will also make your guitar less conspicuous when you carry it on you re less likely to get hassled by a gate attendant or flight attendant while you re bringing it onboard that way if you want a little extra protection you can get a fortified gig case these are still soft but have a little more form and structure to help pad your guitar during its journey keep in mind they are also a little bulkier than totally soft cases your guitar legally must be covered in order for you to take it on a plane as carry on luggage this is required in order to prevent injury to other passengers put your guitar in a hard travel case if you have to put it in the cargo hold choose the hardest sturdiest case possible for your guitar if it s too big to put in an overhead bin and you don t want to pay for an extra seat this will provide the most protection while it s being tossed around by baggage handlers and stored in the hold with other luggage 7 x research source for example if you called your airline and found out that your guitar is too big for your flight s overhead bins or if you re flying on a small commuter plane put it in a hard case if you plan to fly with your guitar a lot invest in a heavy duty flight case these cases are expensive but they are made of very hard reinforced materials and have a lot of foam padding for maximum protection pack your guitar with paper to fill extra space and stop it from moving loosen the strings slightly and put crumpled up newspaper or packing paper in between the strings and the fretboard wrap newspaper or packing paper around the headstock neck and heel to protect them fill in any empty spaces in the case with paper as well 8 x research source you could also use soft items of clothing like t shirts instead of paper doing so can even save you a little room in your other luggage bubble wrap would also work well for this avoid putting any prohibited objects inside your guitar case with the guitar remove anything from the case that is not allowed inside a plane s cabin don t put anything in the case that you wouldn t put in a normal piece of carry on luggage to avoid problems with airport security 9 x research source for example anything sharp bottles of liquids over 3 oz 88 7 ml and lighters are things that are prohibited from plane cabins ensure the total weight of your guitar is within the airline s limit the standard cabin luggage weight limit is 165 lb 75 kg so your guitar won t be overweight for a standard commercial flight weigh your guitar in its case to make sure that it falls under the airline s weight limit if your flight has a lower limit 10 x research source you can call your airline s customer service line ahead of time or look on their website to find the exact weight restrictions for your specific flight you are probably only likely to have problems with weight if you are flying on an extremely small plane since no guitars weigh anywhere near 165 lb 75 kg,Travel
how to measure distance on a map,maps provide you with an accurate picture of a geographic area so you can determine how far it is from one place to another maps provide a fractional scale that tells you the ratio between the distance on the map and the real world distance with the fractional scale you simply have to multiply the map distance by the scale value to find the real world distance however fractional scales don t work for digital maps that can change size such as maps you might pull up on a smartphone or tablet for those maps use the bar scale located at the bottom of the map to measure the distance from one place to another 1 x research source,mark the 2 points on the edge of a sheet of paper take a blank sheet of paper and line up the edge between the 2 points that you want to measure the straight line distance between make a tick mark on the paper for the first point then another tick mark for the second point 2 x research source it s helpful to label each of the 2 points so you remember which tick mark goes where but this isn t strictly necessary since the distance will be the same in either direction place your paper underneath the map s bar scale the bar scale is a black or gray bar typically at the bottom of the map place the tick mark for the first point directly under the 0 on the bar scale 3 x research source the 0 might not be all the way on the left edge of the bar scale some bar scales include fractional distances to the left of the 0 bar scales typically have distance measurements in both kilometers and miles so make sure you re on the right one the units used locally will likely be the most helpful since road signs would be in the same units however if you re not familiar with that system you might want to get a measurement with both 4 x research source read the distance between the 2 points on the scale locate the tick mark you made for the second point on your piece of paper and look at the bar scale the number above that tick mark on the bar scale is the real world distance between the 2 points 5 x research source for example suppose you have a 10 kilometer bar scale that s marked off in 2 kilometer segments the number over your tick mark is 8 therefore your 2 points are 8 kilometers apart if there isn t a number directly over the tick mark you ll have to estimate some bar scales have fractional distances to the left of the 0 that will help you to estimate for example suppose you have a 10 kilometer scale that isn t segmented but your tick mark is halfway between the 0 point and the end your points are approximately 5 kilometers apart create segments if your distance is longer than the bar scale most distances you try to measure will be longer than the bar scale but you can still measure them make a tick mark on your paper where the bar scale ends and write the distance underneath it then slide your paper over so the tick mark you just made is directly under the 0 on the bar scale 6 x research source if the second point is still further than the scale make another tick mark and move the paper over again keep going like that until you reach your destination add up your segments to determine the total distance for distances that are longer than the bar scale on the map take the distance represented by each of the segments you made and add them all together that tells you the total distance from the first point to the second point 7 x research source for example suppose you have a 10 kilometer bar scale you ve measured 3 10 kilometer segments and one segment you estimate to be half of the bar scale or 5 kilometers your total distance between the points would be 35 kilometers 10 10 10 5 look for the fractional scale on the map a fractional scale as the name implies is expressed as a fraction typically at the bottom of the map sometimes it s also expressed as a ratio but the calculations are the same regardless 8 x research source maps have different scales for different purposes for example a road map is typically drawn at a 1 250 000 scale it shows a larger area with roads and towns more suitable for driving a walking map on the other hand might be drawn at a 1 25 000 scale providing more detail about paths and landmarks in a smaller area measure the map distance between the 2 points use a ruler as a straight edge between the 2 points you want to find the straight line distance between place the 0 edge of the ruler at the first point then mark the measurement listed at the second point 9 x research source since you re using a fractional scale the number you find becomes the numerator or top number of your fraction if you re using a road map drawn to a 1 250 000 scale and the distance between your 2 points is 5 your 5 takes the position of the 1 on the scale then you ll have to find the total ground distance that represents cross multiply by the scale to find the ground measurement set up your fraction so that the unit measurement you found is the numerator and x is your denominator multiply the denominator of the scale by the unit measurement you found to determine the ground measurement 10 x research source to continue with the previous example if you found 5 as the distance between your 2 points you would multiply 5 by 250 000 to get 1 250 000 so if you used inches the 2 points are 1 250 000 inches apart from each other similarly if you used centimeters the 2 points are 1 250 000 centimeters apart from each other the unit makes no difference convert your answer into the unit of your choice the fractional scale tells you the real world distance in centimeters or inches to make your answer more usable divide centimeters by 100 for meters or 100 000 for kilometers if you re working in inches divide by 12 to find feet or 63 360 to find kilometers 11 x research source for example you would be unlikely to say that 2 points were 1 250 000 centimeters apart instead you would likely want to convert those centimeters to meters or kilometers when you did so you would find that the 2 points are 12 500 meters 1 250 000 100 or 12 5 kilometers 1 250 000 100 000 similarly if you used inches the 2 points would be 1 250 000 inches apart which converts to approximately 104 167 feet 1 250 000 12 or 19 7 miles 1 250 000 63 360 identify the road or roads between the 2 points place your finger on the starting point and find a road that goes in the direction of your ending point trace your finger down the road to find the route you would need to take between the 2 points you may need to take more than one road especially if the 2 points are far away from each other to keep track of your route trace it in pencil or take notes on a separate sheet of paper place a string along the route put the end of the string at the first point and lay it down directly over the roads you would take if you were traveling to the other point for curves hold the string to follow the curve and then move your finger to the furthest point 12 x research source it can help if you have a friend with you to help you hold the string however you don t need to hold it down all the way from the beginning if you re going around a curve just make sure you re holding down the string at the furthest spot you ve gone so far measure the total length of your string hold the string at the point where it reaches the second point the length of the string from the end to that spot represents the road distance on the map use a ruler or tape measure to get the total length of the string 13 x research source you can also mark the string with a pen or use a piece of tape that way you don t have to worry about dropping the string and losing your spot use the bar scale to measure your string if you don t have a ruler get something to take notes so you can keep track of segments then place the start of the string at the 0 point of the map s bar scale extend the string to the end of the bar scale and place your finger there right down the distance represented by the full length of the bar scale then move the place where your finger is to the 0 point of the bar scale and do it again keep going until you reach the place on your string that marked your destination 14 x research source for example suppose the map has a bar scale that s 8 kilometers long your string has 4 segments the length of the bar scale plus another segment about half the length of the bar scale before you reach the spot on the string for your destination the distance between the 2 points is 36 kilometers 8 x 4 4 be careful not to stretch the string any tighter than you did when you were measuring or your final distance measurement will be off calculate the distance using the map s scale if you measured your string with a ruler use the map s fractional scale to find out the real world distance by multiplying the string s measurement by the number in the denominator of the fraction or right side of the ratio then convert that number to a larger unit such as miles or kilometers 15 x research source for example suppose you found your string is 7 centimeters long and the map you re using has a scale of 1 250 000 multiplying 7 by 250 000 gives you a real world distance of 1 750 000 centimeters which is likely not very helpful if you divide that number by 100 000 however you find that your points are 17 5 kilometers apart if you used the bar scale to find the length of your string you don t need to do this step because you already have the real world distance use a piece of paper to measure segments if you don t have string a string is ideal to measure a curvy road because it can follow the curves of the road if you don t have a string handy take a piece of paper and make a tick mark on the edge at your starting point then follow the road until it curves place a tick mark at the curve then pivot the paper until it s following the road again holding it in place where you marked the curve mark the spot where it curves again and follow the same procedure until you reach the endpoint on the map always keeping the edge of your paper against the road edge 16 x research source when you get done you ll have multiple tick marks on the edge of your sheet of paper hold these to the scale to find the distance for each segment then add them together to find the distance between the 2 points this method may not be as accurate as the string method but in a pinch it s better than nothing,Travel

dots may be a sign of bed bug waste examine the bare mattress and box spring for bugs pull off any bedding and sheets including any elastic bedding that goes around the mattress look for any visible signs of bed bugs such as eggs or the bugs themselves additionally search for hard leftover casings that were shed by the bugs or red brown splotches on the mattress which are both telltale signs of an infestation 3 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source even if it seems tedious it s better in the long run if you examine all 4 corners of the mattress look carefully at the seams of the mattress as this is a popular hiding place for bed bugs to get a closer look beneath these seams lift them up with the thin

how to open a locked suitcase without the combination,luggage locks provide a sense of security in the knowledge that no one can get into your suitcase except for you forgetting the combination to your lock can cause a lot of anxiety especially if you can t remember even one number fortunately there are a few different methods you can try to open your lock and access the contents of your suitcase,push the button on the lock to put pressure on it depending on what type of lock you have either slide the button to the open position or pull down on the lock itself like you re trying to open it this should put the mechanism into the open position on the inside even though you can t open it yet 1 x research source spin the first number dial until you hear a click put your ear up next to the lock and spin the first number dial one number at a time when you hear an audible clicking sound leave the number in position 2 x research source the noise may be very faint so it s best to work in a quiet environment without a ton of noise if you go through all 10 numbers and you don t hear a click you may not be able to use this method on your lock rotate the second 2 dials until they click as well leave the first number in the position that you heard the click and move onto the second dial listen until you hear it click again then move onto the third one 3 x research source make sure you leave the numbers that clicked in place so you continue working towards the correct combination slide the button on the lock to open it once you ve found all 3 numbers you should be able to pull your lock or slide the button to open it now you can write down the combination that the lock opened on so you don t forget it 4 x research source if the lock doesn t open try starting with the last number dial and working your way towards the first one instead using this technique can be kind of tough especially if you re in a noisy area don t get discouraged if it doesn t work for you set your suitcase on a flat surface if your combination lock has an opening at the top where you can see the circles spin set your suitcase upright so you can look into the holes at the top of the lock point a lamp or a flashlight at the suitcase so you can see into the lock 5 x research source some combination locks don t have openings in the top where you can see the rotating circles if yours doesn t you won t be able to use this method these combination locks usually have a plastic button on one side with the 3 number dials at the very top the number dials have an opening where you can see the gears inside of the lock rotate the numbers until you can see the empty spaces in the circles start spinning each number in a counterclockwise motion until you can see the divot in the side of the circles it will be a fairly wide opening on each number and you ll be able to spot it easily 6 x research source the normal surface of the circles has a groove in it the opening will be flat around the edges and hollow in the center spin the circles 2 positions clockwise once you ve found the empty spaces in every circle move each number dial 2 spaces in a clockwise turn this will line the opening up with the lock mechanism on the inside of your lock so it can open 7 x research source if you have a larger or older combination lock you may need to turn your numbers more than twice keep turning each dial 1 position clockwise until you can slide the button to open it up slide the button to open the lock pull the button on the side of the lock to open up the mechanism on the inside now you can access your suitcase 8 x research source if you meet any resistance when you open up your lock you may need to spray some wd 40 into the mechanism to loosen it up write down the combination so you don t forget it take a look at what position the numbers on the lock are at to figure out the combination write them down or take a picture so you can remember the combination for next time 9 x research source shine a light on your combination lock set your suitcase somewhere that you have plenty of lighting grab a flashlight or the light from your phone and shine it directly onto the lock so you can see all the details 10 x research source this technique works great for top down combination locks that don t have any openings where you can see the grooves in the number circles these locks usually have a plastic or metal button on one side with the number dials in the very middle they don t have an opening in the lock where you can see the inside of the number dials look for the metal bracket on the side of each number circle using your light to see look for the metal bracket on the right side of the number circle take note of how it looks smooth and without any grooves on each of your numbers 11 x research source this metal piece is what rotates the number circles on the inside of the lock spin the circle until you see an indent in the metal bracket click one of the circles into a new position one time to show the next number in the sequence take a look at the metal bracket to see if it s indented if it still looks smooth keep clicking the numbers one by one until you see a small opening in the bracket 12 x research source the indent won t catch the light as well as the smooth sides so it will be easier to see under a direct light if you re having trouble seeing the bracket use the pointed end of a safety pin to poke into the bracket and feel the groove rotate each circle until all of the indents face upwards now you can work on the other 2 number circles to find the indents in their brackets keep moving the numbers one by one until all of the indents in all 3 brackets face upwards toward you 13 x research source spin each circle downwards 5 times moving each number circle one number at a time rotate them each 5 different times so that the grooves lock into place this will open up the mechanism on the inside of the lock so that you can open it 14 x research source now you can slide the button to open up the lock write down the combination so that you don t forget it,Travel

you notice the animal s eyes are half opened and it s swishing its tail back and forth like a dog that means it s relaxed and happy be as still as possible when you re riding in an open safari vehicle if you re with a guide or with a hired driver with an open top car be sure to sit down and not make any sudden or exaggerated movements move slowly speak softly and enjoy the experience 10 x research source making swift or large movements might frighten the elephant and lead to aggressive or threatening behaviors stay at least 164 feet 50 m away from the elephants at all times if you re in a car with a hired driver be mindful of how close the elephant is getting to the car most local drivers know to keep their distance but feel free to give them a friendly reminder if they opt to get closer

are pinned to its side its trunk is curled in and its tusks are raised it might charge and you should probably leave the area as soon as you can if the elephant also lifts its head up and throws it back down toward the ground it s definitely time to go 12 x research source if an elephant trumpets their trunk it may be in distress if you see any baby elephants doing this while they re alone it s best to leave the area so the mother doesn t think you re the one causing the distress tossing objects like sticks rocks or brush with its trunk is another sign an elephant feels threatened and might charge if an elephant s ears are slightly fanned out it might be a little annoyed but that doesn t necessarily mean it will charge bring binoculars to see elephants and other creatures up close get a

using your camera phone consider getting an attachment zoom lens so you can zoom in farther and get a clearer picture 14 x research source if you re bringing an expensive camera always keep a close eye on it and your surroundings sri lanka is pretty safe but like anywhere thieves often target tourists protect your skin from the sun with sunscreen hats and breathable clothing sunscreen is a must

travel writing should look like it will also help you figure out what kind of travel writing you want to do try regularly reading one or two famous travel writing blogs for a month or so pay close attention to how they re writing their stories what do they focus on what s their tone how do people respond to their articles every travel writer is different but you ll find they all aim to be informative personable and accessible to readers they convey their personality and their likes and dislikes in what they choose to write about if you aren t sure what sites to visit some popular travel blogs like nomadic matt view from the wing expert vagabond or the planet d are some great places to start 1 x research source don t be afraid to take notes the more information you have the better prepared you will be when you start writing yourself figure out your niche or angle since there is currently a plethora of travel writers both online and in print it s good to have your own point of view this can be anything from writing specifically about food when traveling to writing about a specific activity like deep sea diving or simply going different places for different cultural events like festivals having a niche will also help you be specific and clear in the point you are trying to convey to your reader do you want to give them tips immerse them in the sights and sounds of a particular city describe a food so well they can taste it start a website once you have an idea for what you want to write on and how it s best to build a site as an online base you should keep all of your writings photographs and links to social media on your blog you should also have a mini bio about yourself a small itinerary about past and future travels and maybe a picture of you this site will act as a portfolio for you when you want to get published so the more content you have on it the better there are a multitude of online sites you can use for blogging if you re just starting out try a free website like weekly wix wordpress or blogger if you have a bit more experience and want more options try a paying website like squarespace travel everywhere being a travel writer doesn t just mean going abroad to exotic or foreign places it s unlikely you will have either the time or money to constantly be on the move instead you need to learn to write about all places write on areas you ve previously traveled to or even areas within your local community not everyone has lived where you have and it s your job to make these places accessible to them through your writing try going to local festivals locally owned restaurants parks bookstores anywhere that seems interesting to you look for stories knowing what to write on isn t always going to be obvious especially if you re just writing about your hometown you need to try and see things from a different perspective picture yourself as someone who has never visited and imagine what questions they might have what would

somewhere completely new speaking to other people is a great way to find new stories it can be hard to find things outside of your interests so speaking to different people within the area can help open up new doors for you they can tell you about events introduce you to new people or even take you places on their own you could ask what s the best food around town or is there a local myth or legend document your experience think about what moves you and why when you go to a new place take note of how you feel and react to things did you go somewhere and hate everything what particular events set you off and why sometimes it s difficult to figure out what about an event or place is affecting you so writing down in the moment and reviewing later will help you keep track of these

for you to be giving them a sales pitch about why a place is wonderful you want to be objective but you also want to be true to your experience writing is a personal experience and travel writing should be no different 4 x research source be careful not to be cliche though there are plenty of articles on hidden gems or secret spots in cities these read like advertisements don t write a log of your daily life no one wants to read an in depth account of how you spent every minute of your day you need to focus on small moments and be descriptive use anecdotes tell stories make it personal for example if you are visiting a small bakery in monterosso italy and have a moment of nostalgia because it smells like your grandmother s kitchen tell the reader this publish local or small if you have a local community paper of magazine in your area try getting some of your writings published there first or if there s a particular website you really like try to see if you can submit an article you want to focus small at first and try to develop a relationship with an editor to regularly get your work out there this will help you build up your travel writing resume and portfolio to get more opportunities later 5 x research source you can usually find submission information directly in the paper magazine or on their website if you can t find it try emailing the editor you can write something like ms scott my name is ron conway i am currently working as a travel writer and was looking for some information about possibly submitting an article make connections via social media as difficult or awkward as it can be you need to build an online presence make sure you tweet and regularly update your social media like instagram facebook or snapchat even if you feel no one s paying attention it s best to stay consistent the more things you use the more people you can access and in turn get to come to your blog also try tweeting at people who are travel writers or have blogs related to travel writing don t self promote but contribute to conversations make yourself known for being knowledgeable these people may then come to your blog and later promote you which will get you more traffic make connections in the industry a big part of making connections is talking to everyone you can you never know when a random encounter could connect you to something or someone great

how to buy gifts and souvenirs for others when traveling abroad,people love receiving gifts and when you re traveling it s tempting to bring a piece of a faraway land back to others traveling abroad brings a host of concerns including what to buy and how to carry it back but this can be remedied with a little budgeting planning and taking the time to explore the country you ll have to take these factors into account but when you do you ll find the act of purchasing gifts to be an adventure that leaves a lasting memory,make a list of everyone you re going to buy a gift for the reason for this is to have everyone in mind which will prepare you to shop for gifts specific to each recipient as well as begin to plan out how much you re going to spend write down each name and if you have a specific gift in mind include that as well don t forget yourself add yourself to the list and include everything you wish to get factor this into your budget a good idea is to ask others if there s anything from the country you re visiting that they want this will give you ideas help you research the item for authenticity and price range and make shopping easier set an amount you re willing to spend set a limit for each person when you re out in another country browsing the shops it s very easy to go over budget in addition you have to factor in the costs of miscellany such as snacks and transportation which also contribute to your overall budget and how much you can afford to spend on others 1 x research source currency exchange is another sneaky charge that affects your budget as is your ability to ship all these gifts home research the items you want to buy before you go figure out what a real quality item looks like and what is an appropriate price for it this way when you re in the midst of dazzling tourist shops and foreign prices you ll be much more likely to stay under budget without sacrificing quality if you want to buy a kimono in japan for instance search online for what indicates a kimono as authentic as well as scams to watch out for you can also search online or through guidebooks for tips on where to purchase your items consider the person s tastes the key to bringing home a good gift is to get at the heart of what a person wants the best gifts show that you care about a person and to show that you care you must understand the person keep in mind the person s likes and dislikes and match them appropriately with the amount of money you are willing to spend 2 x research source for instance if a person doesn t like brandy bringing a bottle of brandy home from france no matter how expensive won t work a successful gift will be one that makes a person think of you when they see it this can be something worn such as jewelry but it can also mean any other type of gift if you don t know the person well enough or can t find an ideal gift try getting them something that makes them want to travel even a stereotypical trinket such as a magnet or snow globe can mean a lot to the right person explore off the beaten path it is easy to get dazzled by the flashy tourist attuned shops but moving away from them has plenty of benefits you ll be able to delve into the true local markets for goods that are often cheaper and better quality than the overpriced magnet you were considering you ll also gain a personal adventure to present when you give your gift search for information as to where you can find trustworthy shops and the gift you want ask your hotel concierge a visitor s bureau or search the internet be wary of tour guides many tours have predetermined stops and the shops there may offer the guide a commission and inflate prices consider the gift s durability it s easy to fall in love with a local piece of artistry but it s a lot harder to get it home in one piece once you ve found something you think makes for a good gift stop and consider how you re going to get it home smaller gifts can be packed into a carry on bag but larger gifts are more at risk ask yourself if you have room in a suitcase can risk it getting broken or stolen or can ship by mail and how this impacts your budget consider the gift s size travel magnets may seem like a generic gift but they have an advantage in ease of transportation as well as cost you ll have to bring the gift home and if it isn t something that can easily fit inside your luggage it may not be worth the hassle before you take the plunge on a purchase consult shipping rates for delicate gifts large objects or anything you want to send directly to either yourself or someone else the costs add up and quickly dominate your budget in addition to cost consider the person who will receive this gift a fancy or large gift may seem like a big gesture but they re going to have to incorporate it into their life and environment a decoration for someone in an apartment may clash with the furniture be unable to fit or otherwise be met with less enthusiasm than expected haggle most north american and european travelers won t be accustomed to this getting over the awkwardness though will enable you to get better deals and therefore better gifts many cultures throughout the world still include haggling in their business transactions so don t feel bad about challenging the asking price 3 x research source appropriate places include markets bazaars and small shops you wouldn t haggle in a department store in japan or america check in guidebooks or online for local haggling customs different cultures use different tones for instance and doing it the appropriate way helps your chances at success once you have an approximate maximum price and amount you re willing to spend set aside your cash before you begin as this establishes a budget limit for both you and the clerk always maintain a positive and friendly tone the goal isn t to beat the seller and getting angry won t help take your time don t show much interest and don t be afraid to walk out chances are that if you do this a clerk who once resisted your price will suddenly chase you into the street to offer a more agreeable deal gauge the room in your carry on bags you ll bring these bags with you onto the transportation you chose these are small enough to store under a seat or in an overhead compartment but the fact that you have them with you means they re best for storing valuable or breakable gifts check with your transportation to see how much you can carry in 2017 for instance many airlines allow you to have a carry on bag sized 22x14x9 inches or 56x36x23x centimeters along with a personal item such as a laptop bag or purse 4 x research source for larger sturdier gifts bring a duffle bag these can be stored under a seat or in a plane or bus compartment but if they don t fit they ll be considered checked baggage by airlines and you will be charged accordingly 5 x research source store gifts in luggage most likely you already have a bag that if you are flying you checked in at the airline s kiosk for storage in the cargo hold of the plane it is an obvious place to store gifts but one that is not without risks and potential costs read up on the policies of your transporter before you go consider bringing extra packing material such as towels and bubble wrap in which to cushion breakable gifts some airlines allow for one or even two fee free checked bags but others charge even for the first one as of 2017 united airlines for instance charges 25 for the first checked bag 6 x research source you may also choose to bring a separate suitcase for gifts but beware the costs for example as of 2017 united airlines charges 35 for the second checked bag and possibly 200 for a third one on an international route the size and weight of the bag also affect costs as of 2017 united airlines charges start at 100 for a bag 51 70 pounds and another 100 if it is oversized these charges also double on some international routes ship by delivery service this can be handled by the merchant or you can choose to pack and ship the goods yourself big heavy gifts often have to be shipped by such alternate means but you may find shipping by mail to be a more direct and simpler method in general if the local merchant can take care of shipping get shipping insurance an itemized receipt and pay with a credit card so you can track how and when the gift will be shipped for shipping by hand seek out the office of a shipping service such as fedex ups or dsl a local post office or ask the hotel concierge for guidance shipping services may have online calculators to help you get a glimpse into how expensive this route can be a standard box shipped from japan to australia for instance costs about 50 aud in airmail size weight and customs charges are all factors ship by sea airline shipping for large items tends to be expensive so shipping by sea freighter may be a better option sea freight is cheaper but slower and is best for spacious items such as furniture as they take up more volume an object shipped from america to asia takes over a month to arrive anything shipped by freight still ends up costing several hundred dollars in transportation fees fees from customs may also play a part get through customs this step depends upon the rules of your government but they re bound to have regulations on what you can bring into the country how much you can bring and how much it will cost you as much as possible prepare for this ahead of time and be aware of how duty charges impact your budget in the u s for example gifts carried back on the plane must be declared and in general a combined value of less than 800 is duty free 7 x trustworthy source u s customs and border protection federal law enforcement agency responsible for monitoring u s borders facilitating international trade and upholding customs laws go to source in the u s mailed gifts have to be given clear labels such as personal use purchase unsolicited gift gifts for others and consolidated gift package in the u s a gift shipped to others that costs more than 100 is charged duty the exemption before duty charges rises to 200 on

get by using only public transport well read on for some tips on managing fine just by using trains and buses,do your research at home study up on these through travel guides or the internet what countries to visit this is determined by your interests time finances willingness to rough it etc how far to range in the time you have unlimited time means you can go anywhere but most people have limited agendas for a week don t expect to get to more than one or two countries or two or three separate destinations city monument beach etc the most common transport in your destination countries some countries have only limited train service to anywhere but major cities or the capital that means using the bus system instead some countries use ferries which have different schedules such as scotland greece or norway the must see places be careful if they are all out of the way not in a major city these are always harder to reach and take a whole day or more to get to and away from plan an itinerary decide exactly your schedule being flexible is good but aim for a definite plan to be efficient what you will do every day which are travel days where you will aim to sleep every night which are lay over exploration days get a good map of your destination and study it how far away are each of the destinations how long will it take to get to each one don t think of driving times but bus train or ferry times are there mountains a lake to cross an ocean crossing a footpath in the mountains what terrain must you negotiate study the transport options this is the most important and difficult step from afar check in books or online for national rail services first rail is the easiest fastest and most comfortable also more expensive but it seldom gets you to out of the way areas find all the major routes and lines and schedules check the website of the national rail carrier or eurail how often do the trains run day or overnight print out the schedules book train tickets as much in advance as possible for e g the german rail www bahn de provides a few tickets at euro 29 regardless of the distance but these are only available for a few days from the time the booking is opened currently two months this is quite cost effective if you are travelling long distance intercity within germany consider a eurail interail pass there are several options available on http www

tickets in advance plan ahead most countries require a train reservation even if you are using a eurail interail pass it s about 7 euros per reservation and you must have one especially in france check out bus services this is harder to find but possible search the major national or private carriers in your country there is always at least one if necessary find a way to translate web pages or figure out how to read the cities and scheduled times at least if necessary check ferry services especially in greece be aware that summer and winter schedules vary and that not all islands are served daily some only once a week note that ports may not be in the same place as the city you want to visit ask fellow travelers how they are going and if you can join them or share a ride offer to pay your share most europeans specially in the south will offer you a free ride but you must be brave enough to ask for a lift be prepared to walk a little you may have to carry your gear so travel light you may walk on city streets or down a country road have the best map of the area you can find and carry ask people the way at least say the name of the place with a questioning look note how to get back to the road where you will catch the next bus talk to the bus driver since buses can go anywhere drivers have more knowledge of the immediate area ask them where to get off to walk someplace and what time to come back to the road make sure you find out exactly where to stand on the road recognize what the local bus stop looks like how it s marked read road signs yourself even though you aren t driving notice where you are how far it is to the next point other places that may be possible to explore add your potential transport to your detailed daily itinerary for each travel leg decide the method remember if you mix many different services tickets are more expensive buying a rail pass is the best way if it serves your needs some let you mix bus service with it in switzerland for example

how to travel cheaply in america,the united states of america is an enormous country just the state of texas alone is larger than the entire country of france therefore traveling cheaply around europe tends to be a lot easier than traveling cheaply around the usa however that s not to say there are no inexpensive ways to travel around america or at least less expensive with a little bit of luck and a lot of research you can easily plan a sightseeing trip through america without breaking the bank,make a budget decide what you re willing to spend on travel food etc try not to go over this amount arbitrarily once you ve made up your mind decide whether you have a destination in mind or not while most travelers have a specific place they want to go or a specific sight they want to see being flexible can save you a lot of money for instance many bus and airplane companies run deals on high traffic routes such as new york to boston check and see whether the city nearest to you hosts any of these routes make a list of all the cities and sights you hope to visit plan how much time you ll want to spend in each city and allow time for travel in between cities if you re making a multi stage trip remember to give yourself an extra day or so in each location if you can manage it allowing you to relax and enjoy the trip instead of stressing about the next item on your list look up how much money the attractions you want to see cost try to research whether they ever have free admission many museums for instance provide free entry one day per month for expensive sights look and see if the company provides deals online finally look into whether you qualify for any help from organizations or groups you belong to such as aaa or senior citizen discounts map out your trip don t travel from los angeles to new york and then back to oregon unless you find some incredible deals instead try to hit each stop along the way to the next one choose your transportation option wisely depending on how many stops you plan to make how long your trip is and where you re going you may have better luck with one method of transportation than others buses and trains are exciting and unique ways to see america and often cost less than planes and cars if you book far enough in advance not only do you save money but you get to see the countryside roll peacefully by out the window also you can leave your phone on and many buses and trains now come with outlets at every seat cars are nice because they allow freedom both in and out of the cities you don t have to worry about transportation schedules and you ll easily reach each destination however you also might be stuck driving long distances you could get lost and you re responsible for all gas expenses also if you plan on making a one way trip the car drop off fee can be exorbitant planes can quickly cover long distances but are also often expensive and inflexible it also means that upon arrival you may be paying additional transportation fees since you ll probably have to rent a car or use public transportation around your destination city if you must fly try to find out whether your nearest airport serves as an airline fortress hub or not fortress hubs are airports where a certain airline has a near monopoly allowing them to raise ticket prices out of that airport avoid flying out of these airports if you re hoping to save money additionally pack light to avoid extra baggage fees research options for lodging you don t have to stay in a five star hotel to have an amazing trip there are tons of other more budget friendly options think about couch surfing where kind hearted homeowners allow travelers to sleep on their guest beds or couches often at no cost if sleeping on a couch sounds like the wrong type of adventure look into hostels most major cities have at least one and rates are much cheaper than hotels however you ll probably be sleeping on a cheap bed or bunk bed and sharing a room if your budget is a bit higher you can always stay in a motel or hotel use budget travel sites to find cheap rates inexpensive hotels aren t always the best quality so make sure to read reviews also before making a reservation book early don t wait until the last minute to plan any aspect of your trip while you can occasionally find a great deal by postponing your reservations the risk isn t really worth it you ll get cheaper prices by booking months in advance of your trip most hotels and transportation companies provide early bird discounts sometimes to the extent of cutting your rate in half early early early is the motto of the budget adventurer stick to your initial budget while splurging is okay once in a while after all no trip plan is perfect remember that this is supposed to be cheap travel don t let yourself run up a huge bill that you can t afford be careful where you eat people who live in manhattan rarely eat in times square because there are much better restaurants in the city for far cheaper try using a crowd sourcing website or mobile application to find inexpensive but delicious eateries at your destination take a chance on that small mexican restaurant with great reviews it might end up being your new favorite meal live like a native don t act like a tourist and you won t be treated like one in addition to eating at places where people who live in the city would eat thus avoiding overpriced tourist traps this advice should be rule number one on your trip while you may not notice all the money you re saving by not acting like a helpless tourist you d certainly notice the money you lost if you didn t follow this rule unscrupulous businesses often raise prices on people they know are tourists tourists are also easy marks for all sorts of shady businesses such as the

how to find cheap ways to get home for the holidays,the holiday season is an exciting time of year but it can also be very expensive you might want to save some money by finding a cheaper way to get home for the holidays typically airlines jack up their fares during the holidays because of the increase in demand if you want to avoid high airfares you should consider planning some flexibility into your holiday itinerary booking your flight early and using appropriate search tools if fares look exorbitant or you don t want to fly you might also consider planning a road trip with a friend taking the train or jumping on a bus,go early and come back late since airplane tickets get expensive during the holidays you might try planning your itinerary so that you leave before the holiday rush and return after it if you are self employed this may be a good option if you have a lot of flexibility at your workplace this could also be an option 1 x research source avoid flying on a sunday 2 x research source see if you can work remotely you might consider asking your boss if it is possible to work remotely for a few days if you get approval you can stay a few extra days and take advantage of cheaper flying days 3 x research source look at flying with a connecting stop by booking a connecting flight you may be able to save some money however you should weigh the cost savings against the higher risk of getting delayed or stuck at the connecting airport consider how much savings are worth the extra risk of getting delayed and potentially missing your flight because of an issue at the connecting airport 4 x research source prior to searching for your flight write down a dollar amount representing the cost savings that would be worth it for you to purchase a connecting as opposed to a direct flight use this dollar amount to inform your decision making consider flying out of a different city you can sometimes find cheaper flights leaving from airports in another city if you find a cheaper flight leaving from an alternate city you should also add up the cost of ground transportation to the other airport if the cost of ground transportation plus the cost of the cheaper flight is more expensive than a flight from your local airport perhaps you should just fly out of your local airport if it is cheaper and you have the time it can be a good way to save money 5 x research source if you live in toronto for example you might be able to find a cheaper flight to an american destination by searching for flights that leave from buffalo fly into a different city consider whether your itinerary would allow you to fly into a different city and whether this option would be cheaper you can sometimes find cheaper flights to alternate cities that are still close enough to your final destination 6 x research source see if the savings are significant enough to warrant additional ground transportation to your final destination if you have a friend in a city that is cheaper to fly to and close enough to your final destination you could fly there first and then make your way to your final destination fly on the actual holiday if your holiday itinerary allows for it you could fly on the actual holiday typically people avoid flying on thanksgiving or christmas day as a result flights on these days tend to be cheaper if your family plans allow for it you may as well fly on the holiday itself and save a little money 7 x research source book your flight early the easiest way to save money is to book your flight early you should try to book your flight two or three months

research source use a variety of search tools although many websites will claim to be the ultimate hub for flight searches there is no magic website that will save you money rather it is best to shop around using a few of the big search engine websites and then compare results some websites such as farecompare will allow you to search across a few websites at once and compare results in different browsers 12 x research source search using an incognito browser since airlines may use cookies to survey the flights you are looking for and may adjust prices accordingly you may want to search in

eastern standard time 16 x research source try calling airtran american airlines american eagle airlines southwest airlines and united airlines on wednesday at 1am central time zone 17 x research

or late evening flights since the highest demand is typically for flights during normal commuting hours 21 x research source if you travel early or late you should also consider whether you will end up spending more money on ground transportation check to see if the public buses are running when you need them for an early morning or late evening flight if they are not consider how much you could

your miles for the holiday season however you should note that you may have to use double or triple the usual amount of points needed to get to your destination nonetheless if you are willing to part with the miles or points this approach could save you money 25 x research source get on the train the train can be a relaxing way to travel and can save you money if fares are lower than for flights

holiday rush although train travel is slower than flying it can be relaxing comfortable and affordable book your train tickets at least two weeks in advance 26 x research source take the bus you can save substantial amounts of money by taking the bus home for the holidays since bus fares are typically cheaper than airline fares there are many discount bus services that run between different cities so you should look into the competitors in your region if you take the bus remember to bring a pillow and some entertainment for the ride such as a novel or some portable music drive you can save money by driving home for the holidays you should calculate the cost of fuel for your trip home as well as road trip expenses such as eating out coffee and pit stops if your anticipated fuel and trip costs look lower than airline fares and you have the time to drive this could be an enjoyable way to save money during the holiday season if you have a friend or a sibling who is also going home for the season you could ask if they want to drive together this will cut your road trip costs in half,Travel

the student travel sites offer cheap flights and train passes to hop from country to country within a region too eat cheaply buy snacks from the market when you get there to hold you over throughout the day we ve already said breakfast was most likely included in your boarding situation grab a sandwich or a pizza for lunch and sit down and eat a nice dinner if you re staying somewhere with a kitchen and traveling with a group you can cook meals together instead of eating out it s easy to make tacos or pasta for a large number of people and it s usually much cheaper than eating out it can be fun to eat out at new restaurants but before you do figure out which and how many meals you would like to eat out per trip to save some extra cash investigate phone and internet options it s likely that you ll want to stay in touch with people from home and those you meet along the way different countries have different options for temporary cell phone services so investigate the local options it s quite likely you ll be able to buy a cheap phone with a pay as you go sim card option if not you can certainly buy a calling card that gives affordable rates for calling internationally beware of using pay phones that take credit cards many of these have very high rates that aren t clearly listed at the time of calling find free wifi where you can many phones now allow messaging or even calling over wifi and certainly having an internet connection can allow you to send emails and check in with people via social media find out whether your hostel offers free or cheap wi fi options and

going on adventures just pick your tours and experiences smartly to stay within budget and stay safe allowing yourself to be spontaneous is great but also keep in mind that a little planning can go a long way in making sure you make the most of the trip without going over budget go where the spirit of adventure takes you but also keep an eye on your bank balance and itinerary to make sure you re not veering way off course stay safe nothing adds to the cost of a trip like having your possessions stolen or losing your luggage and being out of pocket for your tickets passes reservations and so on get travel insurance if possible to help cover any losses in an emergency and regardless be sure to keep your possessions safe use lockers and safes where they re provided in hostels and train stations or airports keep your passport tickets and money in a hidden travel pouch close to your body and under your clothing rather than hanging out in a back pocket or backpack just as you would in your own country beware of how you deal with others especially if alcohol is involved your safety is paramount while you don t want to miss out on great opportunities to meet interesting people and have fun you also don t want to be reckless let someone you trust know who you re with and where you re going and stay in contact as regularly as possible travel on there is thrill in the

medications to cure any minor illnesses you might pick up obtain the necessary visas and permits unless you qualify for a visa exemption get all your documentation ready before your trip if you re touring many countries prepare yourself for a lot of forms and paperwork as not all african nations let you apply for a visa online some countries like malawi might require you to get a visa at the

you might think avoid touts from the moment you land at the airport you re likely to run into local touts looking to make a quick buck off a gullible tourist if someone approaches you with a really enticing offer or a product that seems really useful and cheap don t buy it always remember the golden rule if it seems too good to be true it probably is some ways touts will try to entice you might be carrying your bags especially common near the airports and bus stations this scam involves the tout offering to carry your bags to the taxi or to your hotel without asking for an up front payment and then charging you money on completion if you re offered this deal either turn it down or let them know you won t be compensating them tours very often you might be approached by someone offering to take you on a tour around the city sometimes they might even pretend to be your friend first masquerading as a friendly local before demanding an exorbitant sum for their efforts which is likely not even worth paying for selling products see someone selling really cheap sunscreen someone trying to entice you with a pretty souvenir turn it down whatever they are selling is is probably defective visit the local marketplace if you really need something use the tuk tuks for traveling short distances tuk tuks are small three wheelers that can get you places at dirt cheap rates use them as much as possible avoiding radio taxis and other expensive vehicles as much as you can keep in mind that tuk tuks will not travel long distances use trains and buses for long distance travel most

use on food safaris or accommodation together tuk tuks buses and trains can save you a lot of money on travel costs in addition to being cheap many trains pass through beautiful places letting you take in the sights even as you save money use the local marketplace instead of the supermarket if you re coming from europe or north america you re probably used to getting everything you need from huge supermarkets like walmart while there are plenty of supermarkets to be found in africa most of these will charge you much higher rates for items than local markets and bazaars where people sell their own items and produce you can find almost everything you need in the local marketplace with very few exceptions like luxuries cook your own food avoid eating at restaurants or ordering food from outside as these can put a strain on your budget if done regularly save eating out for special occasions and cook you own food when you can using ingredients you bought at the local market cooking your own food is a safer cheaper and healthier option than eating outside if you do not already know how to cook learn a few simple recipes to last you the trip it s not too hard and is well worth the effort haggle everywhere a lot of stuff you buy outside supermarkets will be sold at flexible prices so make sure to haggle avoid paying more money than you need to try to pay attention to how much the locals are paying and haggle till you get there if someone is unwilling to budge it is often worth reminding them that you can always go somewhere else shopkeepers are clever and will often try to rip you off if you re not careful consider camping even if you re staying in a hotel bring a tent along and camp for a few nights after checking out camping can be a lot of fun if done in the right spots and you won t have to pay much if any accommodation charges that night camp near a local settlement or events you want to attend to quickly and conveniently get to your destinations in the morning make sure to bring plenty of food along safari with others going on a safari is one of the most fun things to do in africa but can also be the most expensive you can save a lot by combining

how to choose cheap train travel,choosing cheap train travel is easy if you know how before buying tickets you should know where you want to go look for routes that take a longer more circuitous route to your destination they re often cheaper than the direct trains book as far in advance as possible unless you want to try to snatch a super cheap ticket at the last minute take advantage of any discounts for veterans children and students that the rail lines offer shop around and look at several different rail companies and routes before deciding which tickets you want to buy,buy the individual legs of your ticket separately when people order train tickets they tend to purchase a ticket on a straight shot to wherever they re going but strangely buying tickets for every step along the journey could save you money look for opportunities to engage in so called ticket splitting where possible 1 x research source for instance suppose you re taking a train from washington d c to new york city the train will also pass through baltimore and philadelphia if you buy three tickets one from d c to baltimore another from baltimore to philadelphia and a third from philly to new york you could save money when comparing the cost to buying a single ticket for a trip from d c to new york check the prices on the split tickets to ensure that they total less than what you d pay for the single ticket take the scenic route popular routes are direct and travel quickly to their destination but they are also the most expensive tickets look for less popular routes which are less direct it might take you longer to arrive at your destination but you might save on ticket fare 2 x research source sign up for alerts some railway ticket retailers offer customers the opportunity to get alerts sent to their phone or email trainline for instance will ping your email when tickets go on sale to a location you ve confirmed an interest in other train ticket retailers offer similar alert systems contact the rail line of your choice to find out how you can get alerted when tickets for destinations you re interested in are on discount 3 x research source inquire about discounts some rail companies offer travel discounts for certain passengers children under the age of seven or eight for instance often ride free students military personnel and seniors might qualify for discounts of varying percentages ask the rail company you re booking with if any such discounts exist and claim discounts that apply to you 4 x research source check for cheap first class tickets strangely first class tickets are often cheaper than economy or standard fare tickets this tends to be the case on trains where all the standard class fares have been sold and if you get a first class ticket on the cheap you re in double luck you ve saved money and you get all the amenities of first class fare 5 x research source shop around there are lots of routes with more than one rail company operating on them look at all the companies operating in your area and choose the one that best matches your budget and schedule 6 x research source use a metasearch engine like trainline traingenius or trainbuster to find all the possible routes and lines heading to your destination compare prices for single tickets against the price of a round trip ticket if you re traveling to a destination and back again and if you know exactly when you want to return you might be tempted to book a round trip fare however round trip tickets can be more expensive than two one way tickets bought at different times 7 x research source waiting to buy your return trip ticked is a gamble you might end up paying more for the second ticket than for the first you might also not be able to get a return fare if you wait too long to obtain it look for low booking fees when booking online or over the phone you ll have to pay an additional fee the booking fee to reserve your ticket these fees range from modest to exorbitant depending on which rail company you re dealing with if you don t see the booking fees automatically represented when you re going to check out contact the rail line directly to find out what the full cost of the tickets you want will be 8 x research source get a frequent passenger card if you travel often by rail you might qualify for the train equivalent of the frequent flyer card many rail companies offer discounted fare for repeat customers who have a frequent passenger card contact your rail company of choice to see if any such offer is available 9 x research source avoid peak travel times tickets are often priced according to the time of day when the train runs most people want to travel by train between 4 00 and 7 00 in the evening or any time in the morning prior to 10 00 therefore tickets for trips that operate during those times are often priced more expensively than off peak times if you re in no particular rush to arrive at your destination look for tickets at different times of day to locate off peak tickets that can save you money 10 x research source sundays and fridays are also peak travel times since the rail lines tend to attract people traveling somewhere or other for the weekend on friday then returning sunday from wherever they went buy your tickets early railway companies tend to jack their prices up as the date of departure draws closer in order to avoid getting gouged book your tickets as soon as you know when you want to leave and where you want to go 11 x research source buying early is especially important when shopping for deals around holidays when lots of people are traveling ticket prices rise dramatically buy your tickets at the last minute while it is good practice to buy your tickets early you might paradoxically be able to get your tickets cheap if you buy them at the last possible moment this is because when the train departs the station with empty seats the rail company has no way to recoup the costs of the unsold tickets therefore they attract late coming customers by steeply discounting unsold tickets 12 x research source however if you choose to buy your tickets at the last minute there s a good chance that the tickets will all be sold out therefore it is best to plan ahead and buy your train tickets well in advance of your planned date of departure be flexible in your travel arrangements rail companies often price their tickets in seemingly inexplicable ways for instance tickets to detroit might cost 50 for a wednesday trip but 30 for a thursday trip if you do not urgently need to get to detroit on wednesday check for tickets on adjacent days if you have the good luck to find cheaper tickets on a different day think about pushing your schedule back to take advantage of the lower rates 13 x research source,Travel

how to get a discounted cruise,want to hit the open sea without taking a massive hit to your wallet cruising with style on a budget is possible as long as you know how,choose the dates for your cruise vacation dates in the off season will be less expensive than the peak season if you can schedule your time even a few weeks before or after the peak season you ll save substantially for example the peak season for alaska cruises are during the summer months of june and july if you can sail before or after those dates you ll save decide which cruise line you want to sail on do a little homework and check out the amenities on each vessel to make sure it meets your expectations large ships have more features for time when you re on board but the small cruise ships can get closer to wildlife and the glaciers and can go to ports where the large ships cannot be wary of advertised specials such as discount luxury cruise 599 per person double these advertisements are usually for the smallest interior cabins on off season sailings and do not include port fees taxes and the fuel surcharge get a cruise quote that includes port fees taxes and fuel surcharge if the agency is unable to give that information to you then find another agency your interest should be the bottom line the total cost with no hidden fees these costs can run several hundred dollars per passenger just be aware keep in mind that unless you plan on spending a lot of time in your cabin it s better to get an inside cabin an inside cabin without a window is by far the cheapest the drawback to an inside cabin is that you ll never know what time of day it is since no daylight comes into your room make sure you have a clock note that cabin rates are typically based on two person occupancy in other words the first two people in the cabin will pay the full fare additional people will pay less remember that cruise travel insurance is often recommended by an agency when booking your cruise don t purchase cruise insurance from the cruise line get a separate policy you ll not only save money but you ll probably have better coverage too insurance includes trip cancellation for covered reasons travel delays medical expenses and lost or delayed luggage understand that cruising with a group does not always save you money on your cruise some cruise lines offer a small discount about 5 for a group sometimes you can also get extra amenities like on board credits but some cruise lines do not provide anything additional for a group check out your sunday paper s travel section for some ideas of what the pricing is like for the different cruise lines,Travel

and internet access and then integrate these costs into your trip budget find out the cost of your shore trips and integrate these into your overall trip budget decide where you want to go if you have a particular destination or region in mind for your budget cruise you should stick to it if you end up compromising on your chosen destination in order to save money on a budget cruise you may end up being disappointed however if you have no particular destination in mind you should look into repositioning budget cruises that are typically available on a dime these are budget cruises that go from one place to another in order to prepare for the next cruise season such as crossing the atlantic or going along a coast that is not especially noteworthy 2 x research source determine whether a last minute booking is right for you one can find budget cruises by searching for last minute deals as the departure date approaches travel and cruise companies will begin lowering their prices to get people on board if you have a flexible schedule you might as well book last minute however there is no guarantee that a place on your chosen budget cruise will still be available to avoid disappointment you should either avoid booking last minute or set realistic expectations there is no guarantee of getting on a budget cruise by booking last minute 3 x research source a last minute booking may be a good option if you do not have a particular destination in mind you might also consider booking in low season the low season will depend on the destination of your cruise if you are going someplace that sees a lot of traffic like bermuda the low season is the first few weeks after the start of cruises and before the end of the season in northern europe it can be difficult to find any low season bookings 4 x research source figure out what kind of traveller you are think about whether you prefer to spend time napping and sitting by the pool or whether you prefer to have a lot of activities on a budget cruise depending on how you enjoy spending your time while travelling you will have very different needs for a budget cruise 5 x research source if you are an enthusiastic scuba diver you will want to find a budget cruise that offers plenty of opportunity and time for scuba diving during shore excursions look for a cruise that stops at one of the ten best scuba diving ports these ports include cozumel roatan grand cayman key west grand turk kauai st thomas st maarten tortola and nassau 6 x research source if you want to relax and read a book you should avoid party cruises that cater to younger consumers and find a cruise that has a well stocked library although many cruise ships will have libraries some ships offer more extensive library collections and reading areas for example the oceana marina cruise ship has a beautiful library with leather chairs and mahogany book shelves 7 x research source read budget cruise reviews visit cruise review websites and search for customer reviews by cruise line ship destination and cruise style cruise review sites often also have articles on popular cruise ships and particular cruise destinations read articles and

family cruises entertainment cruises fitness cruises senior cruises romantic cruises gay and lesbian cruises and spring break cruises if you identify with any of these categories the cruise critic website allows you to read cruise reviews for these cruise styles 9 x research source if you find a budget cruise that meet many of your needs but is in a different cruise style than you would prefer you should probably keep shopping for example if you find a budget fitness cruise and you are not a fitness fanatic you might consider looking elsewhere plan to arrive early for your port departure if you are working within tight timeframes avoid the mistake of booking your flight for the same day as your budget cruise departure although the timing might look fine on paper this approach is risky because your baggage could end up being delayed or you could miss a connecting flight to avoid the disappointment of a missed cruise you should aim to fly in to your departure city at least a day prior to the start of your budget cruise avoid scheduling too tightly on shore trips if your budget cruise stops at a port for a few hours or days you should avoid scheduling your trip on shore too tightly if you go too far from port or schedule too many activities or site visits while on shore you run the risk of missing your cruise departure cruise boats will not wait for you if you want to avoid the disappointment of a cruise that ends early and in a highly inconvenient manner you should avoid tight scheduling of on shore activities add up the time for transportation site seeing eating and any other activities you anticipate doing on your excursion once you have an estimated total for your excursion add an extra two hours for unanticipated hold ups such as flat tires or taxis that arrive late once you have the total time for your excursion plus an extra two hours leeway plan to arrive back at your cruise ship an hour early so that you have time to get settled back on board 10 x research source the advantage of taking a ship sponsored shore excursion is that you know the cruise ship won t leave without you because so many of its passengers will be on the excursion 11 x

disappointment set realistic expectations for your budget cruise if you manage your expectations you will be less likely to experience disappointment this includes expectations for yourself during your budget cruise expectations for others such as cruise staff and expectations for family members and friends be realistic about what you might expect from budget cruise staff your family friends and yourself 13 x research source if you bring work on the cruise be realistic about what you might reasonably be able to achieve while on a cruise there will be limited internet and work space there

identification travel insurance card or phone number prescription medicine a first aid kit and seasickness medicine such as behind the ear patches you should also make sure you have all of your toiletries including conditioner since these may not be stocked on budget cruises remember your passport remember to update and pack your passport since most budget cruises will pass across nation states if you have to fly into your departure port you should remember that anything you pack also has to get through airport security pack alcohol if you can find out your cruise alcohol policy and bring alcohol if you desire it and the budget cruise allows if you have a favorite wine or alcohol find out if you can pack it yourself many companies allow you to bring a limited amount of your own wine or beer this will prevent the disappointment of having to purchase poor quality wine or spending excessively at the cruise bar 14 x research source leave some room in your bag for souvenirs if you pack your bags to the point of bursting you may end up being disappointed upon the realization that you have no room for souvenirs the simple solution is to leave a little space for souvenirs at the top of your bag if you anticipate purchasing small trinkets you can leave an extra inch or two of room at the top of your bag however if you anticipate purchasing larger souvenirs such as rugs or larger craft objects like masks you may need to bring an extra bag you can always pack an extra bag inside your check in bag if you are an ambitious shopper 15 x research source if you are an ambitious souvenir shopper and wish to avoid excess baggage fees consider shipping your souvenirs from one of the ports it will probably be cheaper than the excess baggage fee at the airport 16 x research source some common souvenirs that won t make it through customs include absinthe meat based soups objects made from ivory larger souvenirs from cuba iran or the sudan fruit and vegetable products and many designer knockoffs look at the materials that your souvenir is made from and consider whether you have a good chance of getting it through customs 17 x research source avoid work if you bring a lot of work with you and spend your days on your laptop or cell phone the budget cruise may pass you by and end in disappointment to avoid this scenario you should try to get your work done prior to departure if you absolutely must work on your cruise try to schedule short periods of work and then enjoy the rest of your time relaxing eat wisely the all you can eat buffet is not a challenge to your eating abilities arrive early to the buffet and examine the items carefully food left out too long on buffet tables is a common cause of food poisoning which is really not fun when you are out at sea schedule your internet time for the port internet access is often very poor on budget cruises so you should avoid it as much as you can you might end up spending too long getting little done online instead you should check your email and do internet related activities when you come into port 18 x research source skip the casino the casino is a real cash grab that could easily

discounts not all airlines require you to sign up for programs however so pay attention when you are viewing the discount or talking on the phone to an airline representative for example united airlines offers a veterans advantage program members of the military and their families get a 5 percent discount on flights as well as other benefits you need to enroll to get savings 2 x research source keep in mind that most of these discounts and programs have restrictions about both where you board the plane and its final destination usually that you have to board in the us combine discounts once you have narrowed down which airlines offer military discounts and how much you are likely to receive off with each one you can ask if you can combine discounts for example if you are a member of a frequent flyer program you can inquire if your military discount would interfere with use of those points you can also try to find tickets that are on sale such as destination packages and see if you can tack on the military discount ask a travel agent talk to a travel agent who specializes in military travel a travel agent will know about discounts that are available and can find you the most affordable flights available keep in mind however that a travel agent does charge a fee for the time they spend researching travel agents are more worthwhile when you need a trip to be set up

flight their dependents are also eligible 4 x research source be willing to do a lot of searching to find space a seats since september 11 2001 and the twin tower attacks space a seats have become difficult to locate even for military personnel as such you have to do a lot of digging and calling around to find one 5 x research source there is no online search engine dedicated to finding space a

cheaper than using military discounts if an airline will only allow you to use one or the other and the discount that is not military based is better you should use the alternative for example some airlines require that you only use frequent flyer miles if you aren t combining other discounts if you have a lot of frequent flyer miles can t find a space a seat and the military discount is low it is probably in your best interest to use the miles compare military and non military discounts most airlines offer commercial flight sales at different times of year such as vacation packages or rates that go down during off peak hours shop around and compare these deals with the military discounts that you have access to you may not be able to combine the discounts but it is wise to make sure you

the cheapest flights will have very early morning or very late evening departure times flights tend cost a lot less immediately following major holidays be flexible with your travel routes nonstop flights are usually the most expensive options flights with connections may extend your travel time a bit but they can be a far cheaper alternative be aware of the major cities surrounding your destination and look into flights landing there too explore a variety of options before buying your flight for example a nonstop flight to amsterdam could be far more expensive than first flying to london then taking a budget flight from there to amsterdam 4 x research source don t forget to check into regional airports as well the flight search engines rarely include these but you might find some great prices it s definitely worth a look 5 x research source book your flight about seven weeks before your trip while it s not an exact science data seems to indicate that about seven weeks before you intend to fly out is the best window for getting cheap airfare for domestic travel and short haul flights only eighteen weeks ahead is the best time to shop for cheap rates for long haul destinations such as flights that will take you over an ocean to another country avoid waiting to book your flight at the last minute sometimes you can score a cheap flight by taking advantage of airlines trying to fill seats at the last minute however it s not a dependable strategy search for one way ticket prices don t limit yourself to round trip flight searches only with a little research

return one way flight for a highly discounted price don t be afraid to shop around at different budget airlines and mix it up if it will save you money 6 x research source if you use this technique

policies and costs many budget airlines charge for every piece of luggage you travel with often this cost is not factored into the original price quote which may be the reason why the flight looked so cheap at first these fees are often tacked on to the total right before you check out low cost airlines often charge a specific amount for different bag sizes and weights so read their policies carefully 7 x research source look out for airlines that limit how many pieces of luggage you are allowed to carry check into their policies and prices for carry on baggage and personal items such as

codes when you re shopping on airline websites discounts and reduced fees are sometimes available for large families or groups booking flights 8 x research source if you don t see anything listed online you can always call the airline and ask them directly if any discounts are available to you 9 x research source sign up for email alerts visit a few budget airline websites and sign up for their email lists and newsletters you will get information from each airline about flight sales new routes with introductory rates and cheap fares on last minute flights all delivered straight to your inbox this can take a lot of the leg work out of hunting for the cheapest airfares tuesday afternoons are a common time to receive email offers for last minute weekend flights since airlines will know by then if the weekend flights are full yet if there are still a lot of empty seats they often heavily discount the prices and send that information out to their email subscribers 10 x research source join frequent flier programs offered by budget airlines even if you only fly occasionally you should still sign up for rewards programs these programs allow you to collect points or miles each time you fly with that airline once you collect a certain amount of them you are able to use these points or miles to pay for future flights and obtain other related discounts 11 x research source rewards programs are especially helpful to frequent flyers since they are able to amass a large amount of points or miles fairly quickly resulting in access to very cheap or often free airfare book your flights online it s not unusual for low cost airlines to provide discounted prices to those who purchase their airfare online call the airline and ask questions if you have them but when you re ready to actually purchase your flight always do it on the airline s website airlines typically advertise about current discounts and promotions on their homepage if you call to book your flight you may not be made aware of these offers booking online also allows you to look over everything carefully before you purchase anything and easily opt out of hidden fees watch out for hidden fees many low cost airlines provide great pricing when you re searching for flights but then hit you with hidden fees when you re ready to pay search the airline s website for possible hidden fees and read the fine print before you check out 12 x research source don t click buy now to book your reservation until you ve looked the page over carefully for any charges like travel insurance that are automatically tacked onto your total often you can opt out of these charges and save yourself some money be aware of the airline s cancellation policy often there are fees associated with cancelling a flight if something looks too good to be true it might be if necessary call the airline to confirm their fees double check and follow the rules about luggage allowances budget airlines usually have very strict rules about baggage and breaking these rules can result in a significant amount of fees always weigh and measure your baggage before you leave for your flight don t try to guess or eyeball it make sure your baggage stays within the boundaries of these restrictions 13 x research source check their rules on how many pieces of luggage you are allowed to have as well many budget airlines enforce a limit be aware of what low cost airlines don t provide 14 x research source budget airlines are able to offer such cheap prices because they don t offer the typical perks that major airlines provide the planes are older and the seats are usually smaller you won t have a lot of leg room low cost airlines typically don t provide complimentary food and beverages wi fi access or in flight entertainment baggage rules are often very strict and can result in steep fees if you want to fly with a low cost airline you can t expect the perks of a full service flight learn everything you can

how to find cheap airfare to europe,finding cheap airfare to europe can seem like a daunting task even in spite of the plethora of internet travel search engines promising you the best deals these search engines can certainly help but finding cheap airfare to europe requires a little more effort than merely that in order to accomplish this goal you must plan ahead but you should also remain flexible on travel dates carriers and additional flight details,plan ahead at minimum you should try booking your flight two to three weeks before you plan on leaving to lock in the best price but booking between six to eight weeks in advance is ideal rising oil prices mean that airlines are also raising their fees and ticket prices are more likely to go up than down as more time passes go during an off season major holidays are busy travel seasons and august tends to be the busiest vacation month for europeans as a result airline tickets increase in price around these dates the cheapest prices to europe tend to fall out in the middle of winter excluding the gap of time between christmas and new years with moderate prices falling out in the spring and fall depart and return in the middle of the week most people fly over the weekend so weekend tickets cost a lot more than tickets with departure dates set in the middle of the week the lowest prices generally fall out on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays fly to london first from london fly to your final destination flights to london are cheaper than flights to other european cities and countries and flights from london to another european destination are also significantly cheaper than flights to that destination from the united states or canada you can usually save money by making these two separate flights instead of flying direct to your final european destination shop around but focus on travel websites that make their money through advertising travel websites that allow you to compare airline prices can help you find the lowest price relatively quickly but some search websites are better than others some websites have an affiliation with certain airlines making their results biased travel websites that make their money via bookings charge airlines a booking commission to display results from their company as a result these websites may not display budget carriers that refuse to pay such a fee websites that make their money through advertising have no reason to filter out results and generally offer the most reliable honest search results search through a wide range of booking websites especially international ones booking websites based in the united states do not often have listings for all the small airlines scattered across europe international booking websites will

involved in the program and with enough points you can earn discounts and free tickets many of these programs can be used with international carriers as well including many european ones sign up for e

ll get in great shape and your coworkers will think you re awesome why not skip the traffic jam and walk into your workplace with an endorphin rush,find a safe and pleasant route don t just assume that the route you drive to work is the best route for biking often the best bike route includes back streets and side roads which may make your trip slightly longer but much safer and more enjoyable be realistic and honest with yourself are you really comfortable spending 20 minutes a day with the traffic from a freeway feeder whizzing by you at 60 mph 97 km h your local bike shop will probably have bicycle route maps get one and map out your route to work if there are no bike route maps get on your bike on a non work day and scout out the area consider incorporating streets with bicycle lanes when starting out dedicated bicycle lanes are great for beginners although more confident cyclists often consider riding on the road to be both faster and safer taking the lane is when the rider rides down the center of the lane so no car is tempted to squeeze past with questionable spacing be aware of other users on bike paths such as folks with strollers or dogs announce that you are passing on the left when overtaking someone on the bike path a cough or ringing your bell is a minimum if not a pleasant i m on your left do not sneak up behind someone overtaking them without warning them it is more courteous to announce your presence and well in advance you may find that your route to work in the morning is more highly trafficked in the afternoon and that you need different routes to and from work if necessary combine bicycling with public transit more and more transit systems are finding ways to accommodate bicyclists if yours isn t up to speed consider purchasing a folding bike to bring with you on a bus or train or using two bicycles one between home and your stop or station another for between the stop or station and your workplace do a test run of your bike route on a day with light traffic if you don t have a bike yet borrow one and make your test drive before purchasing one it ll give you a better idea of what kind of bike you ll need try some alternate routes if possible make a note of how long each route takes you avoid streets with excessive potholes or junk on the road avoid questionable neighborhoods where your safety might be at risk a public open space is always better than a hidden alleyway determine where you can lock your bike while you are at work ask your manager or supervisor maybe there s a closet or storage area where they ll let you leave your bike for the day otherwise find a street sign that does not pull out of the ground or a post to secure your bike onto with a good lock or more than one to further discourage theft if you lock to a traffic sign remember that it might be possible for a thief to unbolt the sign and then slide your bike up over the top the best thing to lock to is a complete loop of welded metal that is securely anchored into brick or concrete second choice would be a pole with welded cross members wider than the longest dimension of your lock acquire a bike find a local bicycle shop there knowledgeable people can help you decide what to buy see the choosing a commuter bike section below for more advice if you buy a cheap bike at a discount store have it fitted to you so you re comfortable if you buy an investment bicycle you may have a smoother ride but you will always be worried about someone stealing your bike what you buy will be for the same reasons you buy a cheap car purchase the best lock to protect your bike stay away from cables which can be cut one wire at a time quickly too combination locks and locks using a cylindrical key research the local bicycling laws of your area this is essential to remain safe and within the law many places assign bicycles the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle most of the time riding on the sidewalk can not only increase your chances of running into something or someone but it can also earn you a traffic ticket even if stop signs are optional in your area you can never be sure how a car will react if they are at the intersection too register your bike if required learn how to make simple bicycle repairs before you hit the road a flat tire loose brake cable loose seat post or loose handlebar an unbalanced wheel or other minor adjustments may pop up while you re commuting be ready for them prepare and carry a lightweight bicycle specific toolkit include metric allen wrenches that fit your bike s bolts a screwdriver and or a multi use tool designed specifically for bike maintenance a pair of latex disposable gloves can come in very handy because it s hard to get the grease off your hands once you arrive at work a lightweight air pump or co2 cartridge inflation device tire levers and a tube patch kit do not add much weight but on site repairs can be time consuming a spare inner tube is nice but it s only single use without a patch kit a good compromise is to have a spare tube for on the spot repairs and then use the patch kit to repair your tube when you get to work so that you can then use your repaired tube as the spare for the commute home you may even want to invest in flat free tubes or tire liners puncture resistant tires work well if you plan to commute daily especially over gravel or where there may be broken glass they are worth the extra money take safety precautions while riding keep a reasonable distance between your bicycle and parked cars the most common accident for commuting cyclists is running into a suddenly opened car door don t make any sudden turns or weave in and out of traffic make your course steady so that drivers can anticipate your position use hand signals to indicate a turn or better yet invest in an electric turn signal or use the old courier method of physically inserting yourself in front of the car that may turn into you

around the seams or openings it s smart to wrap your clothes in plastic bags as well as keep spares at the workplace shoes socks and underwear at least a full change of clothes if there s room folding shirts can lead to big creases so if you need to look smart try rolling your clothes instead of folding them consider wearing riding clothes and safety gear during your commute often bicycles are not easily accommodated in cities and drivers are not used to sharing the road many people feel much safer with a cycle helmet a bike helmet will protect your head when you are mounting and dismounting common times for falls and it will make you more visible to motorists it will also offer some protection for your head if you have a crash when riding helmets are single use so throw yours away if it s done its job in a crash cracks or flaws are not always discernible to the eye and a new helmet is cheaper than a new head many people choose not to wear their work clothes when they re riding to work if the weather is unpredictable or hot see tips prepare an outfit specifically for rainy days generally what you wear depends on your budget and comfort but during bad weather it s important to be prepared stock up on ponchos rubber overshoes and waterproof gloves look for jackets with ventilating zippers under the arms grocery bags can waterproof a helmet in a snap as well as your seat if it has a porous cover waterproof socks or overshoes are useless unless you have pants to direct the rain over and away from the tops of the socks wool is more expensive and takes special care but it provides a wider range of comfort in the weather than other clothes even keeping you warm when wet don t wear anything that can get caught in the chain or wheels tuck your shoestrings into your right shoe and get a strap to wrap your long pants cuff around your right ankle so that nothing gets caught in your chain ring in humid areas use wicking polyester materials to keep sweat from fostering a skin fungus allow these clothes to dry fully rotating out two sets every other day wash them with mild detergent and dry on low heat hack your bike as needed some extras could make a huge difference in the quality of your ride consider installing fenders on your bicycle to prevent puddles from splashing onto your bike and your body the rat tail fenders that clamp onto your seat post are only minimally effective invest in a set of full fenders stainless steel though heavy is the best most durable solution next best is aluminum bonded to plastic polycarbonate fenders will also do the job but they are of significantly lower quality also be aware that some bicycles especially those designed for racing have very little clearance for installing fenders comfy seats are worth investing in on upright bikes but don t get one that s too big or they will get in the way and chafe seats with a recessed area down the middle reduce pressure on our sensitive areas more padding does not mean more comfortable if the saddle is too soft numbness can become a problem experiment and see which saddle is right for you stay away from gel padded seats they break down under exposure to the elements and create an impossible mess get a mirror you wouldn t drive a car without a rear view mirror would you you can find mirrors that fit on your handlebars your helmet even your glasses get at least one of these at some point you might end up having to ride in the dark as a precautionary measure install lights on your bicycle you don t want to be riding on the roads at night with standard reflectors and riding a bicycle without lights after dark is illegal in some countries install a white light on the front and red light on the back of your bike for after dark led technology is very advanced now offering great lights at easy prices look for units that use aaa or aa batteries which can be swapped out for rechargeable batteries lights with their own rechargeable batteries are more expensive and generally brighter these are for seeing where you are going if you have a nicer road bike and don t feel comfortable locking it outside consider the purchase of a full bike bag which will allow you to roll your bike wheels and all into the bag and carry it inside the bags weigh only about 5 pounds and can be carried quite easily in a backpack if your building has security guards consider a nice holiday bribe they ll call your bag the big laptop stick with it your legs and rear end might be sore for a few days or weeks don t give up you ll get used to the workout soon and you ll start noticing new muscles in your legs keep moving forward and enjoy the scenery don t get sold on buying a mountain bike just because there are a lot of them bike shops are accustomed to stocking bikes for recreation not for commuting and the features on mountain bikes don t really benefit you as a commuter unless you re the aggressive type and need a more sturdy steed swap out the knobbies for durable slicks in this case but don t bother with full suspension if most of your riding will presumably be done on pavement you re better off with a hybrid comfort touring road or singlespeed designed for riding on pavement you may also want to consider a recumbent bicycle ultimately the most important factors when choosing a bike are comfort and efficiency hybrids and comfort bikes are the same thing but have a wider version of the road bike wheel and tire hybrid or smooth version of the mountain bike sized wheel and tire comfort the hybrid is a bit more efficient where the comfort bike takes the bumps better both feature a very comfy and upright pedaling position good for taking the strain off your body touring bikes are beefier versions of road bikes but with more relaxed pedaling position though usually not as relaxed as comfort hybrid bikes converted road and track bikes are quite the rage in flatter areas with a single gear to maintain and no shifting to learn track bikes have a fixed gear so no rear brake is needed once you ve gotten the hang of these stripped down speed machines watch out for your knees though a fixed gear means the pedals are directly linked to the rear wheel eliminating the bike s ability to coast advanced fixer cyclists can ride a fixed gear bike in reverse by back pedaling a recumbent whose lower center of gravity also takes getting used to has a more powerful pedalling position which is infinitely more comfortable faster recumbent bikes have pedals higher than or level with the seat lower pedals indicate a more comfort oriented recumbent most recumbent bikes offer better aerodynamics than other bikes once you get up to speed as well as a seat back to add leverage against the pedals the lower point of view makes you wish you could see through cars sometimes and must be recognized longer recumbent wheelbases are more stable where shorter wheelbases are quicker and more maneuverable test rides are generally offered at good recumbent shops so take your time choosing and testing if you re looking to avoid the body pains of upright bikes carbon fiber bikes generally don t allow bolt on accessories such as panniers and kickstands this means that if you buy a carbon fiber bike you will most likely have to use a backpack which can be hot on a summer day also it may be more likely to fall over without a kickstand,Travel

how to travel to antarctica,travelling to antarctica is one of the most exhilarating trips you will ever take although it s expensive it s truly spectacular a trip to antarctica is something that you and your travelling companions will never forget it is an inhospitable and distant place so travelling there is unlike travelling almost anywhere else there are however a number of possibilities for intrepid explorers who want to witness the majesty of this frozen continent whether you want to take a few weeks exploring on a ship or fly over it in a day with some careful planning and a generous budget you can have the trip of a lifetime,travel on a cruise ship by far the most common way to travel to antarctica is on a special cruise ship these trips vary but are typically between 10 days and three weeks long 1 x research source you can take various routes to the peninsula depending on where you are departing from the advantages of these cruises are that everything is provided on the ship and you get to see antarctica and its wildlife close up for an extended period of time most voyages to the antarctic peninsular region leave from ushuaia tierra del fuego in argentina port stanley in the falkland islands and a few leave from punta arenas in chile buenos aires in argentina or puerto madryn in argentina decide whether to travel on a larger cruise ship or smaller one there are a variety of ship sizes that you can travel on ranging from around 45 passengers total at the smaller end to 280 passengers at the larger end both have their advantages and disadvantages in general the larger the ship the more comfortable and well equipped it will be but the less opportunity you will get to land on antarctica yourself and see things up close in high seas larger ships are the most comfortable but the strict guidelines on how many people can visit the shore will limit your opportunities for shore visits smaller ships allow for more time on shore this is because tourist guidelines limit landings of tour groups to 100 people 2 x research source all reputable cruise operators will be registered with the international association of antarctica tour operators iaato so this is good place to consult during your planning they support environmentally friendly travel to antarctica 3 x research source the costs for these cruises will vary but for a ten day trip expect to pay at least 4500 whereas for the longer trips it could be from 12 750 16 000 sail to antarctica on a yacht it is possible to reach antarctica by yacht but this is not commonplace and is more for specialist yachtsmen than your average tourist there are a number of yachting companies that are sanctioned by the iaato and conduct trips to antarctica who can you contact 4 x research source yachts tend to leave from ushuaia or stanley and are only for the very courageous and adventurous for these smaller ships the conditions are much more treacherous than the larger cruise ships 5 x research source this is a very expensive option that could cost more than 1000 a day for each traveller 6 x research source travel on a french re supply ship one left field option is to travel on a french re supply vessel as a tourist the ship marion dufresne ii leaves from r√©union and the round trip takes around a month the number of tourists allowed aboard is limited and you will have to contact french tourist agencies for up to date information on departure schedules availability and prices 7 x research source prices start from around 8 000 for the month take a fly over probably the most straight forward way to see antarctica is from above you can book yourself on a sightseeing flight over antarctica which enables you to see its great white landscape from the comfort of a plane taking a sightseeing flight is a good option for day trippers who want to spend a few hours over antarctica and get back the same day you can enjoy the views while antarctica experts give talks on the plane and you are served food and drink 8 x research source australia is now the only place you can take these flights from 9 x research source you need to plan ahead if you want to do this and book early if you want to get up and close and see the wildlife this is not the choice for you depending on your seats tickets will cost anything from 1 000 to 8 000 10 x research source get a flight that lands on antarctica if you want to touch down on antarctica there are a number of companies that offer this service leaving from a variety of places where you choose to go from will depend on the rest of your trip so think about whether it would be better to travel from australia chile south africa or argentina and fully investigate the schedules from each place bear in mind that flights to antarctica are much less frequent and less predictable than ordinary flights some adventure holiday companies have deals which involve landing on antarctica and skiing camping and climbing 11 x research source you can fly to king george island from punta arenas in chile and stay overnight at a camp there for tourists investigate fly cruise options another option is a fly cruise package which cuts down the time spent on a ship avoiding the notoriously rough drake passage but still enables you to get a close up view of the landscape and wildlife you can fly to king george island and then get aboard a ship which will take you around the area this could be a good option if you want to see the ice and wildlife up close but don t want to spend so much time travelling on board a cruise ship but it won t be any cheaper expect to pay something in the region of 10 000 to 14 000 for a two week trip 12 x research source remember bad weather can ruin your plans be aware that flights are subject to cancellations due to weather and other safety issues this is true for any flight but the extreme conditions on the bottom of the world make this a more frequent occurrence the best approach to assessing flight options is to read guidebooks written specifically for antarctica or check specialist websites as the details change yearly depending on availability and interest choose the right time to visit antarctica s tour season covers about five months mostly over the southern hemisphere summer november to march all other times of the year are extremely cold dark and the pack ice freezes out a long way be aware that while there will be less people around later in the season much of the wildlife will already have left and headed out to sea during these months some of the things you can expect include during november the pack ice starts to break up and it s mating season for the penguins and other birds during december and january the penguin chicks hatch and are fed and nurtured in the breeding grounds during february and march the penguin chicks fledge the adult penguins molt and the whales are easy to spot 13 x research source expect a large hole in your budget this is one travel destination where budget travel is not much of an option unless you re hired to work hard at a minimum you will probably be facing at least us 5 000 and that is for the bare necessities and not necessarily the best seating or opportunities it is possible to get cheap last minute deals with cruise ships in places like ushuaia in argentina you need to be in town flexible and able to set off straight away this is a risky option but if it works you could save quite a lot of money 14 x research source if you don t want to visit as a tourist think of other options such as joining a government expedition to antarctica for this you ll likely need suitable technical scientific medical or other relevant skills like cooking for a large group you will also need to be considered to have a suitable background for government employment 15 x research source another possibility is to travel as an invited part of a crew some people get asked to come along as journalists photographers artists etc and their trip is covered by whoever invited or sent them along again this will depend on your skills understand the health and safety issues the antarctic environment is dangerous for human beings the weather can deteriorate rapidly and it is always cold even in the summertime highs in the summer along the coast generally range from 41 56 f 5 13 c there are dangers such as crevasses on ice fields and glaciers and fire hazards are high in the very dry environment so handling anything flammable must be done with care read up on the gear and clothing you need you will definitely need excellent waterproof clothing your cruise ship will most likely have things to hire if you don t have them but they might not be a great fit 16 x research source there are no vaccination requirements for antarctica but you should be fit and in good health because medical treatment will be basic and spread thin among all your passengers any medical conditions that you do have should be detailed by your doctor in letter form especially if you need to bring along medication respect the fragility of the antarctic environment the antarctic environment is fragile and apart from expeditions bases and some tourists there has been little human change wildlife remains unafraid of humans because of the lack of long term negative interaction it is important to respect the pristine nature of antarctica and to ensure that tourism doesn t have a negative impact there are visitor guidelines adopted under the antarctic treaty that regulate visitors actions at antarctica and it is worth reading them as part of your preparation for the visit some of the basics to keep in mind include don t go too near wildlife and don t do anything to disturb wildlife don t litter don t deface anything all human built structures have historical value and many huts etc have heritage listings do not engrave anything into rocks or other land features take photos and nothing else leave all eggs shells plants rocks fossils soil etc where they are enjoy your trip of a lifetime this is one of those trips that people who take it can never forget or stop talking about if you love

taken into consideration traveling by train can take longer than traveling by car 1 x research source get a good guidebook fodor s rick steves and the michelin guides are all excellent places to start make sure you have the most up to date guide book for the area of the world you intend to visit some are updated every year others are updated every other year or every few years a good guidebook is a 15 20 investment that can save a lot of headache don t be afraid to rip it up and staple together only the pieces you need a well kept guidebook might make a nice souvenir but it may not be worth the extra weight of carrying around information that you don t need understand the basic customs of the area before going on the trip research what is and is not acceptable in your destination when you arrive observe how others act in person remember some things are okay for locals to do but not for tourists to do learn some basic phrases of the country you are going to this is just polite even if you struggle with it the locals will appreciate that you ve at least tried their language instead of rudely asking do you speak english or whatever your native tongue happens to be if you use the native language to ask for something expect the reply to be in that language and at normal conversational speed which is going to be faster than the audio lessons you learned this is not to say that you shouldn t learn some basic greetings and questions you should however be ready for the responses 2 x research source get a reliable map of the area you are going to memorize it and note each of the places you will be visiting keep your map safe and dry if you have access to a laptop or a smartphone with data you may not expressly need a physical map but it is still usually smart to carry one as a backup 3 x research source be aware of common scams in your destination examples include the dropped ring scam the fake petition and friendship bracelets tied on your wrist by aggressive vendors also be aware of other common crimes especially pickpocketing tsa approved travel locks and money belts are both helpful especially in areas where pickpocketing is extremely common 4 x research source

with thieves know what each local coin and bill is worth for example in panama everything is tied to the us dollar so money comes in the same size denomination and material in the uk you ll find 1p 2p 5p 10p 20p 50p 1 and 2 coins as well as 5 10 20 and 50 pound notes by knowing your denominations and specifying how much you are handing over you can help avoid another common scam intentionally incorrect change prepare your travel documents make sure your passport is up to date and won t expire before your trip ends different countries have different requirements for passports and visas but in general your passport should not expire less than 6 months after your expected return date look into vaccine requirements the country you re going to may require you to have certain vaccines up to date make an appointment with your doctor to get this taken care of as well as other medical considerations get travel insurance check you have the appropriate cover and look into international health insurance chances are that you will never fall ill while traveling abroad but it has happened bones have been broken people have gotten food poisoning pregnant women previously cleared for travel have gone into premature labor consider whether the added expense is worth being safe rather than sorry 5 x research source decide where you re going to stay housing choices are largely a matter of budget comfort and convenience you can pay for a private hotel room or share a hostel stay with friends or family or explore online travel communities like couchsurfing com airbnb or wwoof org think about staying in an apartment if you ll be in one place for more than half a week hotels can be expensive and you can often get much better deals for renting out someone s house furthermore this approach might give you a more authentic idea of what it s like to live in a given city consider a bed and breakfast or a self service vacation rental this last type of accommodation can help save money as they re often cheaper than hotels and you ll save money by buying your groceries and cooking there instead of going out to eat figure out how you re going to get around your options are broad and varied and you ll have to choose the best mode of transportation to suit your itinerary if you will be traveling long distances between destinations you might consider flying or taking trains if you ll be traveling within a city or region try biking renting a car or using public transportation research the place you re going and try to understand how the locals get around trains can be relaxing over long distances consider taking night trains in theory you can sleep on the train and awake as the train pulls into your next destination if you plan to rent a car look into insurance requirements consider applying for your international driver s license ferries are a solid option for crossing water they are usually cheaper than another plane ticket with better food don t take animals plants or anything else that s not accepted on flights if you plan to travel with your pets look at the rules and regulations for traveling with them to keep them out of quarantine this generally includes a certificate of health from your vet making sure that rabies vaccines are up to date having them microchipped and even a certificate of health from your local government office such as the department of agriculture in the u s make a list a few weeks before the trip the list should include everything you are going to take with you you can put these items into separate columns under what bag they are going in if you don t have everything you need write it down then buy it when you are shopping this way you can prepare everything so you are organised if you are still struggling with what to pack you can find an online rough guide with the essentials and basics when you are all packed take out you passport and any other travelling documents and keep them with you in a separate bag with your purse and phone so it all stays together pack efficiently no matter how you re traveling extra bags and unnecessary things will weigh you down as travel writer rick steves says you can t travel happy heavy and cheap pick two a few classic pieces that are easily mixed and matched and a knowledge of how to use the local laundromat can save you money on overweight baggage fees know the common dress codes for your destination for example if you re visiting the vatican women will need their shoulders covered research airline regulations for what you can pack if you re flying you don t want to exceed the maximum weight extra or overweight bags often cost more money and most airlines don t allow carry on bags over a certain weight consider leaving basic toiletries behind you don t have to take everything you think you ll need nearly every country you ll visit will have basics like toothpaste deodorant soap and contact solution and you can t carry more than an three ounces of any liquid in carry on luggage anyway carry copies of your prescriptions in case you run out,Travel

how to drive on murram roads in east africa,driving on murram 1 x research source roads in east africa is challenging and requires additional skills when compared to sealed or tarmac roads,always check your vehicle for faults vehicle maintenance standards vary and may not be to the vehicle manufacturers specifications consider emulating airline pilots armed service personnel and some police forces who always do a walk around visual check prior to entering a vehicle craft check all fluid levels in particular it is essential to check oil and water daily due to the harsh operating conditions experienced in east africa check all tyres for tears splits and at least visible tread not forgetting the spare check that there are the correct number of wheel nuts on each wheel it is not uncommon to find only three or four nuts on a five nut wheel spare wheels are often missing from vehicles in africa a puncture is going to be your most likely breakdown on murram roads due to their harsh nature on tyres many 4x4 drive vehicles are not permanent all wheel drive check the front wheel hubs if there is a lockable hub 2 x research source if planning to travel in the rain or through wet mud consider engaging the hubs refer to the vehicles operating instructions if unsure if the hubs are not engaged and you slide into a ditch or bank you may not be able to access them and therefore may not be able to utilise the vehicles 4x4 capacity to drive out if you think that you can t get stuck in a 4x4 vehicle then you have not been trying hard enough see 3 x research source for a real life story about driving on murram it is unlikely that there will be any form of vehicle roadside recovery available being stranded in the african bush overnight is not likely to be comfortable or particularly safe ensure that there are maps in the vehicle that cover the area that you plan to travel to consider getting a local person to write down the name of the place that you are travelling to in the local language consider taking enough water and food to last at least the length of the journey and possibly enough to cope with a short delay consider taking a basic medical kit for presonal use only be very wary of potential health risks dangers associated with treating anyone else ensure that you tell someone where you are going and when you plan to arrive or return make an emergency plan of what to do if those arrival return times are not met no show allow plenty of spare time before implementing the plan take the following factor into your emergency plan events happen on rural roads in africa that can take time to circumnavigate look out for rain washouts missing bridges etc especially after heavy downpours animals cows goats snakes don t drive over them wait stuck stranded or abandoned vehicles market days get very busy pedestrians and cyclist especially on market days other crowds especially around ceremonial times like funerals circumcision ceremonies weddings political rallies etc many murram roads are heavily cambered to protect them from heavy rainfall this means that the usual place to drive is in the center of the road for maximum comfort for passengers and driver predictably this causes a problem when faced with a vehicle travelling on the opposite direction when see a vehicle approaching do not start to move over to the side if you do the other driver will assume that you are willing to give way and will just keep on coming straight at you in the center of the road possibly even driving you into the side of the road the usual way of passing could be compared to playing chicken approach the other vehicle head on slowing down considerably to little above walking pace and at the last moment gracefully pull over to the side and the other vehicle will hopefully be doing exactly the same allowing a safe passing with neither vehicle being forced into the ditch or side of the road remember to keep your thumbs out of the center of the steering wheel as potholes can snatch the steering wheel out of your hands and hit your thumbs hard remember that when driving on dry murram you have much less grip and need to take care to slow down more in corners and brake more gradually remember that when driving on murram muddy patches pot holes can snatch the steering wheel from your hands slow down on poor murram surfaces use the vehicle s air conditioning if you have it since driving on murram can produce a lot of dust otherwise stay well behind any vehicles in front or even consider pulling over for a minute to allow their dust to clear before proceeding be aware that many local people may ask for lifts check with your insurers company employer for their policy regarding passengers many do not allow them avoid accidents hopefully if you follow the above guidelines accidents will be avoided however the protocol in many countries in africa when involved in an accident is different from what occurs in places like the usa and europe if involved in an accident in one of such countries be aware that a large crowd may quickly gather be very noisy and intimidating with lots of blame and shouting very likely do not stop drive immediately to a police station and report the accident get help you will achieve nothing staying at the scene and could put yourself in considerable danger if the crowd believe that the accident was your fault if you stay to argue your case or try and help anyone who is injured and there is a subsequent problem you will be deemed responsible with possible disastrous consequences,Travel

their own items and produce you can find almost everything you need in the local marketplace with very few exceptions like luxuries cook your own food avoid eating at restaurants or ordering food from outside as these can put a strain on your budget if done regularly save eating out for special occasions and cook you own food when you can using ingredients you bought at the local market cooking

how to travel around the world,traveling around the world at once is often a cheaper option than breaking it down into segments the secret is to plan carefully and purchase the ticket well in advance the cost is more than made up for by the amazing experience of seeing many places in a short period of time and the memories you ll have for a lifetime here are some tips for how to travel around the world,price your trip as an around the world ticket this will be much cheaper than booking a dozen one way flights 1 x research source the two largest airline alliances are star alliance and oneworld the star alliance is the bigger alliance star alliance is based on how many miles you travel and they offer passes in 29 000 34 000 or 39 000 miles increments 2 x research source to put that in context 29 000 miles 47 000 km you will roughly get 3 continents outside of the united states 34 000 miles 55 000 km will get you 4 continents and 39 000 will get you 5 or 6 continents the more miles you do the more destinations you can see and vice versa each pass allows up to 15 stopovers a stopover is considered 24 hours in one destination and you can get the ticket in first business or economy class star alliance also requires passengers to start and end in the same country though not necessarily in the same city there are also passes which are limited to geographic regions in the world 3 x research source oneworld offers two different pass options one that is segment based and the other that is mileage based global explorer is oneworld s more conventional mileage based ticket there are three levels 26 000 29 000 and 39 000 miles in economy class as well as a 34 000 in business and first class 4 x research source just like the star alliance mileage based rtws all miles are counted including overland segments 3 x research source air travel is generally the most expensive way to travel use flight comparison websites like travelsupermarket skyscanner and kayak or flight brokers such as travelocity expedia and opodo pay close attention to restrictions many around the world tickets mandate that you must always be travelling in the same direction eg l a to london to moscow you could not go l a to paris to london this takes significantly more preparation get into the frequent flyer mile credit card deal if you have good credit aren t afraid to use credit cards and have some savings you can score thousands and thousands of miles to pay for your airfare there are tons of offers out there most banks have some version of a credit card that has partnered up with an airline such as the american airlines citi card 5 x research source you have to spend a certain amount of money in a set period of time but the rewards can be huge tens of thousands of miles you ll need around 120 000 to get an rtw ticket consider alternative methods of travel for most of us frequent flyer miles just aren t an option it requires a lot of forethought and money luckily there are plenty of cheap options and they re often more interesting leading to more memorable experiences for train travel in the us you can travel by rail with amtrak if you booked in advance it can fit any budget for non eu citizens in europe look into eurail passes for eu citizens interrail passes are a good bet in asia the trans siberian railway goes from moscow to beijing there you can connect to shanghai and onto tokyo a global eurail pass is around 500 390 and will get you to 24 different countries moscow to beijing on the siberian railway with stops in irkutsk and ulaanbaatar costs 2100 1635 for the no frills 16 day trip for each extra person the cost lowers for bus coach greyhound is the line to travel in the us the european equivalent is eurolines where you can travel between 50 or so cities and megabus actually operates on both sides of the lake only going intercity though all greyhound buses are equipped with air conditioning an on board restroom reclining seats with headrests footrests and tinted windows in addition buses make rest stops every few hours and meal stops are scheduled as close to normal meal times as possible 6 x research source lille to london through eurolines can be as little as 36 28 one way if you re only visiting a handful of cities it can be a good alternative to eurail they also offer a free luggage allowance of two medium sized bags for ship ferry travel cruises can be a frugal option of you think about the money you re saving on accommodation and food some companies even offer operate transatlantic cruises ferrying from new york to hamburg you can feel like you re on the titanic know if you need a visa the last thing you want to do is to get stuck in saigon getting yelled at by a man who tells you that you have to go back to hong kong in certain countries you might have to pay an exorbitant fee to get a visa immediately but it s hands down best to know what paperwork you have to have the length of your stay and your citizenship are both important factors for most westerners it s easy to assume you can go wherever you want unfortunately that s not the case do your research well ahead of time it can take weeks to get a visa approved and if you re exiting and re entering a country know that process too you may need a different type of visa look into hotels and hostels of course if you have family and friends in the area stay with them but if they re all back home hotels and hostels are the standard option some hostels are slightly fishy so do your research beforehand don t let the one bad hostel ruin the whole bunch there are quite a few reputable chains and you don t have to go wandering up a dark alley to find one hostelling international makes finding one easy and just like booking a 4 star hotel if you re willing to share accommodation with strangers you can really get a bang out of your buck and you might meet some fascinating people consider couch surfing or woofing though it may seem too good to be true couch surfing has a huge following and is a completely legit form of travel couchsurfing can set you up with people just like you all over the world if you re willing to stay a bit longer consider woofing you ll work on an organic farm for as little as a couple of weeks in exchange for a roof over your head and a some meals you can build up your skills and get much more into the culture than if you stayed in a hotel frequenting your mini bar get into house sitting even better than couch surfing house sitting has entire networks now that let you stay in a place for free just to feed the cat on many house sitting sites for an initial fee you can put up your listing and don t forget to sell yourself and meet people looking to leave their home in trustworthy hands understandably there are far more people looking to house sit than house sitters when you sign up do some research on creating a striking profile think of it as a job interview where you re in a pool of thousands of applicants because you are set yourself apart from the herd in whatever way you can pack lightly unless you have your own personal assistant laying down rose petals 4 paces ahead of you that can carry your 12 piece luggage set you ll want to pack as lightly as possible there will be a time or two or three or four when you have to carry it all around it could be between checkout and check in times for a few hours or it could end up being all day when your hotel reservation gets lost or your flight gets delayed in addition to a few basic sets of clothes some reading material some hygienic products and small electronics make sure to bring an international plug adapter you ll be incredibly grateful when you re stuck in phnom penh with a dead computer needing to book the next leg of your trip set a budget based on where you are going how long you will be there and whether the country is 1st 2nd or 3rd world you ll need a matching budget there will always be unexpected expenses so add a solid for emergency category obviously first world countries are the most expensive europe canada usa japan second world countries are a bit harder to define but are usually somewhat developed mexico eastern europe china egypt third world countries are the cheapest but most difficult places to travel most of africa bolivia peru se asia think safely going around the world can be as dangerous as you let it be take the appropriate precautions to avoid being taken advantage of alert your bank some banks are highly security oriented and will cancel your cards if it mistakes your overseas transaction as suspicious activity to avoid this call them before you leave to inform them of your exact itinerary not just that you re traveling it s also a good idea to call them when you get back don t carry around your valuables in a bag that can get easily swept of your shoulder or cut without you noticing invest in a money belt or small purse that is worn close to your body keep your cash credit cards and passport in this buy your own groceries making your own meals will dramatically cut costs as opposed to eating out every meal europe doesn t have to be as expensive as they say it is living like a local will be much more rewarding than traveling like a tourist go to local supermarkets bakeries and general stores to get a feel for the local flavor not only will you save money but you ll get an experience you cannot get at home and see things you ve not seen before do your research if you re on a shoestring budget don t fret you can still find things to do that are either very cheap or free most bigger cities have an arts or theatre scene that is so lively you ll have more options than you can manage time out trip advisor and similar travel sites have comprehensive listing of things to do and see for some of the bigger cities in the world if you find yourself in one of these cities check it out to get the most out of your trip guidebooks can be great but they can also be misleading what happens when a popular guidebook lists a spot as a best kept secret that no one s going to everyone starts going to it do use it as a general guideline but take everything with a grain of salt ask around who knows better than the locals if you re staying at a hotel or hostel ask the staff if you re couchsurfing sometimes your host will volunteer to show you the ropes and if you re worried about the language keep your eyes peeled where do the people seem to be flocking to stay in touch for safety purposes every few days find an internet cafe and email your parents or friends so they know where you are in case of an emergency it s not difficult to get a cheap phone if you re staying in an area for a reasonably significant amount of time it may be as simple as switching out your sim card only bring your computer if you re working or otherwise truly need it otherwise it will be cumbersome and you ll just worry about it being stolen make the most of it you re about to embark upon a journey that will be life changing let it meet new people do things you didn t see yourself doing and learn from it this may be your one opportunity go with the flow if you run into a group of colombians that are looking for a 6th to go skydiving don t write it off if 100 people are standing in line at a nearby comedy club join them spontaneity can pay off with the best of them skip the knife and fork and burgers it may take a little voice inside you pushing you along but cave to it venture from the backpacker area and find a cafe full of men smoking drinking and playing some foreign card game and order that rack of live prawns that gets grilled in front of you you ll leave not only with photos and souvenirs but memories to last a lifetime,Travel
how to sail around the world,sailing around the world has been done by government funded explorers in the past however in modern times people of all kinds are doing so even people in their teens knowing the expenses involved the risks and how to go about planning your trip will mean the difference between a successful trip and one that you must abort it can also mean the difference between a dream almost attained and a dream come true,volunteer to be on a crew if you didn t win a boat in a contest or inherit one from your rich uncle or decide on an impulse buy at your local boat store a good way to get on a vessel that can circle the globe is to be on a crew contact or visit the nearest marina to you to find out if any boat owners are seeking workers on their boats generally your work will pay your way however you could also obtain a position on a cost sharing boat such a boat has a crew that shares the costs which are typically 20 to 70 per day per person but beware of boat owners that advertise cost sharing arrangements that will cost you more than 1 000 per week typically this is a very high amount and the boat owner is trying to make a profit off of you instead of having you simply share some of the costs get on a friend s boat sometimes those already spending their lives sailing just want companionship if you re lucky you may be able to find someone you trust who can give you a free ride just for being the charmer that you are it might not last forever but would they want company for a few months you can help out as needed of course just make sure you re not jumping on just anybody s boat for the free ride when you re in the middle of ocean with someone you are literally in the middle of the ocean with them you re completely stuck with nowhere else to go and no one else to turn to so before you sign up make sure you can at least tolerate them willingly be a teacher or nanny another way to get on a boat that s already sailing the seven seas is to help out with children there are families that find themselves living on the water needing help with raising their children and keeping them on track for when they resume a normal school schedule

instruct and more if you have a skill why not take it to sea it could be anything from a large cruise line to a family s private super yacht you just have to find the gig gigs on a cruise ship are easy enough to find with today s technology getting a position on a smaller boat can be a little harder stick to your local port and keep an ear to the ground a lot of it is networking knowing the right people and timing or just buy your own boat and learn how to sail if you have 75 000 to spend you could just buy your own boat and get it up to snuff provided you have the sailing skills of course if you re a newbie to the global sailing community and most of us are speak with others in your sailing community who have taken long journeys on their boats ask for their recommendations on which types of boats work best and what you can do to join the elite in general you ll want to purchase a boat that is 35 to 45 feet 10 7 to 13 7 m 10 67 to 13 72 m long the boat should be a sailboat

make sure you have the most up to date guide book for the area of the world you intend to visit some are updated every year others are updated every other year or every few years a good guidebook is a 15 20 investment that can save a lot of headache don t be afraid to rip it up and staple together only the pieces you need a well kept guidebook might make a nice souvenir but it may not be worth the extra weight of carrying around information that you don t need understand the basic customs of the area before going on the trip research what is and is not acceptable in your destination when you arrive observe how others act in person remember some things are okay for locals to do but not for tourists to do learn some basic phrases of the country you are going to this is just polite even if you struggle with it the locals will appreciate that you ve at least tried their language instead of rudely asking do you speak english or whatever your native tongue happens to be if you use the native language to ask for something expect the reply to be in that language and at normal conversational speed which is going to be faster than the audio lessons you learned this is not to say that you shouldn t learn some basic greetings and questions you should however be ready for the responses 2 x research source get a reliable map of the area you are going to memorize it and note each of

certificate of health from your vet making sure that rabies vaccines are up to date having them microchipped and even a certificate of health from your local government office such as the department of agriculture in the u s make a list a few weeks before the trip the list should include everything you are going to take with you you can put these items into separate columns under what bag they are going in if you don t have everything you need write it down then buy it when you are shopping this way you can prepare everything so you are organised if you are still struggling with what to pack you can find an online rough guide with the essentials and basics when you are all packed take out you passport and any other travelling documents and keep them with you in a separate bag with your purse and phone so it all stays together pack efficiently no matter how you re traveling extra bags and unnecessary things will weigh you down as travel writer rick steves says you can t travel happy heavy and cheap pick two a few classic pieces that are easily mixed and matched and a knowledge of how to use the local laundromat can save you money on overweight baggage fees know the common dress codes for your destination for example if you re visiting the vatican women will need their shoulders covered research airline regulations for what you can pack if you re flying you don t want to exceed the maximum weight extra or overweight bags often cost more money and most airlines don t allow carry on bags over a certain weight consider leaving basic toiletries behind you don t have to take everything you think you ll need nearly every country you ll visit will have basics like toothpaste deodorant soap and contact solution and you can t carry more than an three ounces of any liquid in carry on luggage anyway carry copies of your prescriptions in case you run out,Travel

to travel the world as an introvert is to do so while working instead of being tied to a job where you have few or no opportunities to travel the world get a job that enables you to do so many people are discouraged from traveling because they believe they will lose out on potential income traveling while working though guarantees that you have a constant source of income even while traveling 12 x research source for instance lots of introverts have great success as writers or photographers both of these occupations allow you to work more or less alone and in any location you want to news outlets advertising departments and other content producers might be interested in your work use social media your family and friends back home will be dying to know all about your travels keep them in the loop by posting photos and writing updates about where you ve been be candid in your impressions of your travels ask them about life back home so that you can stay connected to the people who know you best 13 x research source if you re not keen on social media you could always use email or snail mail everyone loves getting postcards from exotic places staying connected with your core group of friends and family back home can stave off loneliness when you re out traveling the world pretend you re outgoing even the most introverted introvert eventually hankers for some conversation

them you can easily strike up a conversation that requires little effort on your part by asking these fellow travelers to regale you with their escapades for example when you re settled into your bus

yourself into traveling if you don t want to accept yourself by saying to yourself the world is full of many different types of people my introverted nature is not hurting anyone so i feel comfortable being myself it s okay to make yourself available for conversation but know when you ve had enough interaction for the time being don t feel bad about not wanting to socialize you should never feel guilty just because you are not outgoing don t let anyone make you feel about traveling the world as an introvert for instance if someone asks why you re traveling by yourself just say well i m kind of an introvert 19 x research source if you meet people who want to do something with you don t let social expectations and pressure dictate your response instead be honest whether that means accepting the invitation or declining it if you decline an invitation and the person wants to know why you don t want to hang out just say i m a bit tired or i d prefer to spend the day alone instead

tour company provides practice speaking the local language as an introvert you might be doubly reluctant to engage in speaking a foreign language if you have a bit of practice before arrive though you ll gain the confidence you need to communicate when practicing with others in foreign language classes or in real life situations 22 x research source get a detailed dictionary and self learning language book in order to better understand how to read and write the language the best books will also come with an mp3 download code or cd so that you can practice hearing and speaking the language if they don t get an audio series that teaches the language and repeat the phrases you hear there are many online resources to learn the language you re interested in for instance check out duolingo or lang 8 which can help you learn through games videos and chat rooms you probably don t need to really learn the local language unless you re planning on staying in a particular country for some time however a few crucial phrases like where is ___ and how much does it cost could come in handy look for others like you during your conversations with other travelers you might have the good fortune to chance upon other introverts if the person on the bus next to you also has their nose tucked into a book and has their noise canceling headphones on nudge them gently and ask what are you reading strike up a conversation about where they re headed and explore the possibility of staying in contact with them when you both arrive at wherever it is you re headed 23 x research source

is worth seeing in this area you can also talk to your hosts about areas where you can find a great meal ask them do you know of any good locations to dine in this area if you re planning an extended stay and need help with the local language ask motel clerks or heads of households where you re staying for a few useful phrases and tips wake up early if you re traveling with a long term tour service that takes you through an entire country or region you might want more unstructured time to yourself than the tour schedule provides waking up an hour or so early can help you recover your needed alone time use the time to read write or reflect on your travels 26 x research source invent a project for yourself if you re feeling lonely or isolated look for ways to focus your energy and attention in a positive way for instance go out of your way to visit weirdly themed restaurants or try to take pictures of all the statues you can in a given city these projects can help you put off creeping feelings of isolation that might crop up on the road 27 x research source you could also make a list of all the restaurants of a given type in the major cities you visit for instance maybe you want to visit all the pizza joints in shanghai or all the vegan diners in philadelphia alternately you could aim to journal for at least 20 minutes every night about your experience that day order room service if you re staying in a hotel that offers room service take advantage of it you ll have to pay a bit extra but in return you ll get to spend your mealtimes in the privacy of your own room you can use the time to correspond with friends back home write in your journal or update your blog 28 x research source bring a book if you re on a long ride and don t want to talk to others or look out the window the whole time a book is a great way to pass the time pack a few books and look for places to exchange them for others when you re done 29 x research source most major cities will have at least a few bookstores with english language books check your guidebook for such stores you might also have luck looking for books in the common area of the hostel you re staying at many hostels have a community bookshelf where you can trade a book of your own in exchange for another you can also of course read your book at night before bed and when you re dining out remember when you re reading you re never really alone pack a pair of headphones a quality set of noise canceling headphones is essential for any introvert s luggage that way you won t have to listen to crying children or the irritating music that sometimes gets piped in on long train rides plus when you have your headphones on the likelihood that anyone will bother you drops dramatically 30 x research source if you re cramped for space in your luggage a pair of high end earbuds will do in a pinch when used in combination with a book you re even less likely to attract people trying to interact with you 31 x research source enjoy the experience extroverts might see travel as unenjoyable or unsuccessful if they haven t ended their trip with a bunch of friends that they didn t have before traveling the world but introverts can see travel for what it really is and experience and a set of memories that are bigger than themselves as an introvert you should stay in the moment and do what you do best by not putting yourself at the center of the action 32 x research source,Travel

coffee powder a biscuit butter cheese noodles etc know about altitude sickness himalayan mountains have the highest altitude as the himalayan rescue association likes to point out the himalaya starts

500m above sea level extreme altitude is from 5 500 to 7 500m above sea level the way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air a slow and steady ascent is vital adequate hydration is also helpful the body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high dry environment drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon the warning signs are headache lack of appetite nausea feeling of tiredness and sometimes vomiting this stage of mild

lengthy low season mid april to mid december prices of hotels can fall by 40 or more package deals can be common and popular port towns can be far less crowded this time of year the downside is that many of the more popular resorts close their doors during this off season in addition the trade winds aren t as prevalent in summer so the chance of encountering oppressively muggy weather is higher summer is also the hurricane season and it is particularly bad in august and september when some hotels restaurants and shops close for the month if your primary interest is in the culture of the islands however this can be an ideal time to visit know the costs involved if your caribbean dream vacation includes hiking through a rain forest snorkeling along colorful coral reefs exploring mayan ruins and sunbathing along the miles of picturesque white sand beaches you will find it all here but paradise does have its price the cost of living is relatively low on most caribbean islands but by

budget review these pointers 1 island choice choose your caribbean island wisely as there is a huge difference in price flights to jamaica and cancun are plentiful therefore the price is going to be significantly lower than if you fly to the dominican or st marteen 2 consider a caribbean cruise instead this is a marvelous option should you be interested in seeing many different islands great for the whole family but can also work well if you are single many cruises cater specifically to singles club med vacations were built upon this tradition 3 look for package deals where your flight hotel and car rental if needed are priced as a single unit this will invariably save you time and resources in planning out your perfect caribbean vacation 4 remember to always barter this is after all the caribbean islands where bargaining is the rule not the exception do not over tip this can be a mistake as it could signal thieves in the area into thinking you are an easy target 5 remember that summer and fall months are the cheapest though this is also hurricane season most expensive time is during march and april as the caribbean spring breakers are out in full force with many hotels sold

out such as by hotel star rating lowest to highest price sort by amenities etc here is what to look for 1 does the resort cater to families 2 if you are going there to party and meet new friends or spring break than look for the hotels known to be hot spots for the younger crowd read the hotel reviews trip advisor is the leading and most trusted site providing literally millions of travel reviews helping you make more informed decisions consider a caribbean all inclusive deal an all inclusive is where you pay one low price that includes your lodging food drinks and recreation they even

include spa treatments even though you book at a spa resort all inclusive book caribbean all inclusive vacations far in advance for best deals though it is known that last minute deals can save money this is only because the hotel is trying to fill the space last minute as well by waiting like this you run the enormous risk of not getting a room at all in addition these last minute travel bargains will almost never be choice rooms rather these are the rooms no one else wanted booking in advance simply outweighs any benefits of waiting caribbean dining caribbean restaurants are plentiful and

early settlers of the region rice is the staple of a caribbean meal you ll find the rice on each island may be a little different it is eaten with a variety of sauces and beans another caribbean

how to choose a travel destination,choosing a place to go when you have the opportunity to travel can sometimes be overwhelming however you can easily narrow your choices down with a thoughtful approach considering basic concerns like what you and everyone else coming along enjoys doing is an important first step from there factoring in how much money and time you have will further help you choose between destinations finally comparing your final choices based on additional concerns like the time of year and ease of travelling will help you decide between them,consider your interests write a list of activities that you enjoy brainstorm others that you would like to try for the first time narrow down your destination options by knowing exactly what you expect to be there waiting for you 1 x research source such activities could include physical pastimes like hiking swimming or skiing cultural activities such as museums dining and theater rest and relaxation such as spa treatments or simply reading a book poolside factor in your current needs now that you have created a list of things you enjoy in general take a step back examine your life and situation as it stands today ask yourself what you would want most out of a trip if you were to go on one this minute then go back through your list and cross out those activities that don t suit your needs at the moment 2 x research source for example if you ve been working 60 hours per week fixing your house up during your off hours and training for a marathon you might appreciate more laidback activities that will allow you to unwind such as sightseeing or cultural cuisine related experiences conversely if you re bored stiff by your routine you may want to climb out of your rut by challenging yourself with more adventurous pursuits such as waterskiing or even skydiving take fellow travellers into account if anyone will be travelling with you such as family or a significant other have them write their own list s of preferred pastimes share your lists as a group discover which activities everyone hopes to experience so you focus on destinations that will make everybody happy 3 x research source if there s an odd duck in the group whose interests don t match everyone else s ask them to prioritize items on their list so at least some of their expectations are met for example if their 1 priority is hiking while everyone else is more interested in museums shopping and theater consider going to a city that also offers a lot of walking tours if only you and your significant other are going on this trip and your lists don t match consider letting one person decide on a destination this time around and then let the other decide your next trip research travel destinations consult online and print publications to find locations offering the experiences that you are seeking and that can accommodate the group you re traveling with or just you use tourism websites travel blogs and travel guides to gain an idea of what is out there search by location say italy or interests like top 10 destinations for rock climbing 4 x research source ask friends family or other associates for recommendations and warnings based on their own travels however maintain a healthy skepticism when researching be on the lookout for sources that are attempting to sell you something out of date information reviews based on a different set of criteria than yours determine your budget figure out exactly how much you can afford to spend on travel so that you aren t breaking the bank for this trip at the same time determine what luxuries you can and can t do without with this info whittle your list of preferred destinations down even further according to cost 5 x research source ask yourself if you are willing to stay at a campground or hostel in order to see the sights you want to see or if you need comfier accommodations make the same call regarding food is dining out an integral part of your dream vacation or are you willing to live on peanut butter sandwiches to reduce costs research costs of living first come up with a list of items that you expect to purchase while travelling then for each destination you have in mind research the costs of those items to make sure they don t exceed your budget remember that an american dollar for example doesn t go as far in nyc as it might in smalltown usa 6 x research source factor in basic items like say grilled cheese sandwiches if that s what you ll be living on as well as items specific to your trip such as theater tickets if you are considering other countries also factor in the exchange rate between their currency and yours also consider whether each destination has a tourist season when costs may rise above their off season norm 7 x research source decide how much time you have to travel now that you have a firm budget figure out how long it has to last you determine how many days including travel time you will spend away from home use this number to better decide which activities you want to focus on and how much money you are willing to spend on them 8 x research source a brief trip like a week or two may enable you to spend more on luxuries like fine dining and accommodations or it may make a steady diet of pb j seem more doable so you can spend your money on things like scuba gear rentals broadway tickets or high end shopping 9 x research source a longer trip of a few weeks will allow you to visit multiple places such as all of holland instead of just amsterdam you may have to sacrifice some luxuries in order to stretch your budget but with so much time at your disposal you can also utilize more cost cutting options such as indirect flights if you re traveling with children you ll also need to consider their school schedule and whether or not you want them missing school consider travel deals look for all inclusive or partially inclusive travel deals that charge a flat fee for things like travel fare accommodations and food sign up for alerts from companies offering discounted travel or lodging if you plan on traveling regularly find companies that offer loyalty programs 10 x research source think about convenience research the realities of day to day life in your dream destinations as well as any hurdles that you will have to overcome in order to get there then ask yourself how much hassle you are willing to endure in order to travel weigh this against the benefits of travelling there to make sure that your trip will still be a positive experience in the end consider things like 11 x research source whether you will need to get a passport visa and or vaccinations beforehand which will also have to be factored into your budget how developed their infrastructure is in terms of medical services public transportation roads internet and cellphone service and availability of atms and or currency exchanges how comfortable you ll feel when visiting a country or region where you don t speak the local language what special needs you or fellow travelers may require based on age disabilities or medical conditions consider the season in addition to deciding how long you will be travelling decide when you ll be going for each destination research what weather you should expect during this timeframe decide whether these conditions are tolerable to you then judge their impact on the activities you hope to pursue while there 12 x research source for example if you don t mind the extra heat humidity and afternoon thunderstorms there is little difference between visiting puerto rico in the summer and any other time of the year on the other hand if you re an outdoorsy type who hates the bitter cold but who can only currently travel during the winter you may want to postpone that trip to maine for another time also consider the weather s impact on your health or those who will be joining you based on age medical history and current health take special events into account of course a special event like spending new year s eve in times square may be part of a destination s draw for you 13 x research source but if not research each destination s cultural calendar to see if they will be hosting any big activities during your stay there if so gauge whether this will add or detract from your own experience research how large of a crowd will attend based on past numbers then find out how this number affects availability for things like accommodations tickets restaurant seating and transportation consider the nature of the event versus the people you will be travelling with planning a family vacation to say daytona beach during spring break may not be the best idea make sure the destination is safe stay up to date about the current environment for each destination although it is impossible to foresee every eventuality be on the lookout for any trends that indicate consistent danger if traveling abroad refer to government websites such as https travel state gov content passports en alertswarnings html for alerts and warnings about specific areas always consider 14 x research source health risks such as outbreaks of diseases civil unrest like protests riots rebellions and war spikes and trends in crime environmental concerns like seasons of high risk such as hurricane or wildfire seasons review your final choices if you ve narrowed your list to a couple of choices instead of one stand out compare the two apply the same criteria that you used to eliminate other choices find out if one seems more sensible doable and enjoyable than the other follow your gut if your final choices still seem equally appealing after a second comparison forget the checklist take a step back clear your head and give yourself some time wait to see which destination you find yourself dreaming about more listen to your heart and go with that compromise with fellow travelers if your group is equally torn between two destinations work toward an agreement ask for everyone s reasons for their preferred choice based on these try to find a solution by considering things like the likelihood of being able to travel as a group again in the future so you can visit both whether individuals in the group will have a chance to go to their top pick on their own in the future timely considerations like the season special events and once in a lifetime opportunities whether a previous option that has already been nixed for this or that reason should be reconsidered if everyone can agree to it,Travel
how to choose a destination as a first time traveler,if you re a first time traveler you may find it difficult to decide on a destination whether you ve got so many options you don t know how to boil them down or you can t think of a single place you re really interested in there are several ways to cut through your uncertainty and select a destination once and for all you can review your other interests in life or your larger goals for traveling in the first place alternatively you can make a purely practical choice based on affordability and if all else fails make your decision an adventure in and of itself by randomly selecting your destination,look at your hobbies one of the best ways you can decide on a good destination is by reviewing the hobbies you enjoy in your everyday life as these can provide valuable insight into what kind of a place you would enjoy visiting for example if you do karate or capoeira in your spare time you might want to consider going to japan or brazil respectively where you can explore the history and current manifestations of these ancient folk practices or if you play an instrument in your local orchestra you could consider going on a tour of european capitals with historic orchestral groups and theaters 1 x research source even if your hobby doesn t have a particular geographical or cultural origin you can still use it to guide your travel destination decision making for example if you re a big film buff you could look for domestic and international film festivals taking place around the time you want to travel flip through your history books when thinking about what places you might want to visit think about your historical interests if you re still in school flip back through your textbooks and see if you remember any units which interested you in particular if you re out of school take a look at your home library or internet search history to see what kinds of historical topics cultures and events have interested you in the past you ll be amazed how actually visiting the historic sites you ve read about can change your perspective and enhance your understanding 2 x research source for example if you ve got tons of books on the gold rush or ancient chinese dynasties you might consider a road trip through the american west or a sight seeing tour of beijing as potential points of destination don t limit yourself to the bookshelf check out your netflix and amazon cues to see what kind of historical documentaries if any you tend to watch or flip through your favorite channels for any clues check out your favorite movies and novels you might not be a fan of non fiction or history but this doesn t mean you don t have certain cultural or historical interests think about your favorite movies novels and music and ask if you d be interested in visiting any of the places depicted in them for example if you ve read the complete canon of fyodor dostoevsky or william butler yeats you might want to experience the cities st petersburg and dublin respectively which influenced these literary giants just because your favorite movie is ben hur doesn t mean you have to go to jerusalem or rome for your first destination filming locations often differ from their fictional setting so you could make your objective to visit particular filming locations rather than the places in the story don t write off this option just because your favorite fiction takes place in fantasy worlds game of thrones for example films on several locations in northern ireland and you can tour the elaborate sets and locations of lord of the rings in new zealand 3 x research source think about your favorite foods if you live in a big city with the world s cuisine at your fingertips you might think that traveling across country borders to taste some authentic thai indian or french food seems a bit pointless or extravagant in fact though many restaurants adapt their authentic dishes to meet the pricing expectations and taste preferences of the country in which they operate 4 x research source it s fairly safe to say then that you ll learn loads more about your favorite cuisine if you visit its birthplace with the growing popularity of culinary and baking shows there are many organized tours across the world devoted specifically to culinary history and tasting or if you re more of a lone wolf when it comes to lifestyle and traveling you might want to plan your own itinerary using a favorite cookbook or the recommendations of a travel journalist such as anthony bourdain or rick steves 5 x research source ask yourself if you re going primarily to relax most experienced travelers automatically base their travel plans off of their intentions and priorities for vacation for example experienced senior citizen travelers know they re going abroad for some rest and relaxation so they choose low key destinations with plentiful amenities take a page from these seasoned ramblers and

source remember that your history heavy itinerary especially if it s guided by an agency or official group probably won t offer much genuine cross cultural exchange so if this kind of exchange is

an important part of traveling if you re excited about getting dressed up and going out on the town consider choosing a major urban center or a mid size town with a reputation for serious recreation and nightlife if you plan on curling up by the fire with a book by 9 pm every night and rising early every morning you might want to avoid big party destinations in order to avoid the crowds and noise

safety in the wild favor well traveled destinations there are many reasons that it makes sense to travel somewhere popular when going alone the main factor is safety related to this you ll have a much easier time finding places to stay that are fun and affordable in popular tourist destinations another important consideration is companionship even if you re traveling along to get more in touch with yourself there will be moments you want to share 12 x research source account for logistics there are a few specific factors you should consider about potential destinations in terms of logistical concerns for instance it is advisable to go somewhere with an accessible reliable method of transportation 13 x research source if you are a relatively large human in terms of height or weight traveling in certain areas such as central and south america may often be uncomfortable while this may not bother everyone it can be rougher than expected several hours in a bus seat designed for a much smaller person for instance if internet connectivity is of high importance to you be aware that some countries will have far slower and less commonly available internet than you re used to malaysia is a good option if you want to visit southern asia as technological advances have made internet more accessible here than in other parts of the region 14 x research source consider visa requirements some countries are surprisingly hard to get into while others don t require a visa at all for short stays depending on where you re from you are also unlikely to be allowed into some countries at all an embassy to your destination country is the best source of knowledge about visa requirements and availability 15 x research source some countries in africa and the middle east will be especially hard or even impossible to get into this is especially true of countries where islam is extremely prominent or ongoing conflicts give cause for concerns about the safety of tourists you may also need certain vaccinations to be allowed to enter certain counties especially in africa weigh the benefits of a pre determined route another factor than can contribute to safety and ease of travel is a well established travel route within a certain country if you re hoping to move around as opposed to simply visiting one city this is especially important 16 x research source another benefit of an established circuit is a higher likelihood that you re able to find temporary traveling partners to share the road with you re also more likely to meet people who can give you valuable tips about what to do in short having a bit of an established route can take a lot of stress out of planning and it won t prevent you from simply going with the flow whensoever the mood strikes make reservations but have a back up plan in addition to a somewhat established route try to plan where you ll stay ahead of time as well if staying in hostels call ahead to see about availability if they re pretty open you can probably just show up and book a spot when you get there and leave your plans open in the meantime however in busier seasons or cities it s worth reserving places ahead of time 17 x research source either way flexibility is key to a successful trip whenever you re making reservations ask about cancellation policies and avoid making bookings that will heavily penalize you for changes always have a backup place in mind too especially when you don t make formal reservations go where you want to go one of the greatest advantages of traveling alone is that it s entirely up to you how to spend your time though it may seem obvious it s worth reminding yourself that you should be doing what you want to do in fact consider deleting instagram and posting minimally if at all on facebook you can always share photos later in the meantime be where you are and do whatever you feel like 18 x research source state otherwise this vacation is all yours you want to go to the creepy doll museum do it you want to take surfing lessons for the third day in a row heck why not without a traveling partner you ll be much more free to do literally exactly what you want to do be as social as you want you shouldn t feel obligated to try to meet people but it s worth maintaining casual conversations with people you meet while traveling you ll get inside knowledge about the area or worthy stops along your path it can also be incredibly exciting to meet people and interact with them without much context which can happen most naturally while you re traveling 19 x research source of course don t hesitate to spend time on your own as well walking in ancient cities or through landscapes you ve seen before can be deeply enriching on your own you ll really get to listen to your own thoughts in a way that being in a new place inspires be careful the one major negative about traveling alone is that you don t have the security that comes with the presence of others in fact if you re going out at night you should do so with other travelers even during the day stick to public areas that are frequented by families and professionals 20 x research source if you re drinking keep it moderate one drink too many can lead to dangerous situations especially in cities where you may stick out another vital safety measure to take while traveling alone is sharing your whereabouts with someone back home further make sure someone knows how to get a hold of you if need be let someone know your itinerary as well as the specific places you mind up staying along the way while you may want to turn your phone off to enjoy your vacation you should keep it with you keep it charged and turn it on once in a while to make sure no one has been trying to reach you,Travel

how to travel in europe by public transport,you ve always wanted to travel through europe but you don t have a lot of money you don t want to rent a car though it would be nice but wonder if you can get by using only public transport well read on for some tips on managing fine just by using trains and buses,do your research at home study up on these through travel guides or the internet what countries to visit this is determined by your interests time finances willingness to rough it etc how far to range in the time you have unlimited time means you can go anywhere but most people have limited agendas for a week don t expect to get to more than one or two countries or two or three separate destinations city monument beach etc the most common transport in your destination countries some countries have only limited train service to anywhere but major cities or the capital that means using the bus system instead some countries use ferries which have different schedules such as scotland greece or norway the must see places be careful if they are all out of the way not in a major city these are always harder to reach and take a whole day or more to get to and away from plan an itinerary decide exactly your schedule being flexible is good but aim for a definite plan to be efficient what you will do every day which are travel days where you will aim to sleep every night which are lay over exploration days get a good map of your destination and study it how far away are each of the destinations how long will it take to get to each one don t think of driving times but bus train or ferry times are there mountains a lake to cross an ocean crossing a footpath in the mountains what terrain must you negotiate study the transport options this is the most important and difficult step from afar check in books or online for national rail services first rail is the easiest fastest and most comfortable also more expensive but it seldom gets you to out of the way areas find all the major routes and lines and schedules check the website of the national rail carrier or eurail how often do the trains run day or overnight print out the schedules book train tickets as much in advance as possible for e g the german rail www bahn de provides a few tickets at euro 29 regardless of the distance but these are only available for a few days from the time the booking is opened currently two months this is quite cost effective if you are travelling long distance intercity within germany consider a eurail interail pass there are several options available on http www eurail com but if you re not traveling everyday consider buying your tickets in advance or failing that at points of sale within the train station it will probably be much cheaper to buy intercity tickets in advance plan ahead most countries require a train reservation even if you are using a eurail interail pass it s about 7 euros per reservation and you must have one especially in france check out bus services this is harder to find but possible search the major national or private carriers in your country there is always at least one if necessary find a way to translate web pages or figure out how to read the cities and scheduled times at least if necessary check ferry services especially in greece be aware that summer and winter schedules vary and that not all islands are served daily some only once a week note that ports may not be in the same place as the city you want to visit ask fellow travelers how they are going and if you can join them or share a ride offer to pay your share most europeans specially in the south will offer you a free ride but you must be brave enough to ask for a lift be prepared to walk a little you may have to carry your gear so travel light you may walk on city streets or down a country road have the best map of the area you can find and carry ask people the way at least say the name of the place with a questioning look note how to get back to the road where you will catch the next bus talk to the bus driver since buses can go anywhere drivers have more knowledge of the immediate area ask them where to get off to walk someplace and what time to come back to the road make sure you find out exactly where to stand on the road recognize what the local bus stop looks like how it s marked read road signs yourself even though you aren t driving notice where you are how far it is to the next point other places that may be possible to explore add your potential transport to your detailed daily itinerary for each travel leg decide the

during those ages list all the things that you require such as airport transfers to your house a wheelchair a walker a slow pace all meals provided audio tours airport assistance and more decide if you want to go by yourself or with a spouse or friend or if you want to plan a tour and find a group of 20 to 40 people to go with you tour companies are set up both ways in some cases you must find the people and advertise the trip and in other cases you can simply sign up for a trip that is coming start looking for tour companies with your list of preferences in mind keep in mind that you rarely find the perfect tour but with a little compromise you can find one that you are happy with the following types of tour companies are often used by senior or elderly travelers if you want to choose an education focused tour then look into exploritas formerly called elderhostels this organization works with universities to provide classes seminars sightseeing and expert tour guides they do cruises as well as land based tours aarp once the american association of retired persons endorses grand european travel if you get this magazine or you are a member look on aarp org for discounts off

student travel programs that often let you take parents or grandparents along these trips are created with the senior s pace in mind the trip attempts to bridge the gap of interests between generations request applications from your favorite providers choose your tour and see if friends or family also want to go if others plan to come make sure you list your rooming preference on your application usually there are 2 people to a room choose a tour well in advance many travel companies allow you to pay in monthly installments which can make an expensive tour much more affordable if you are retired and you are on a pension try to plan your trip to europe at least 1 year in advance ask about additional fees these include air fuel surcharges tipping for tour directors or bus drivers spending money transportation fees airport transfers and more each company has a different policy about these fees some companies include some fees in their quote and others do not consider

will require a higher fee but you will usually receive a refund of the base cost of your trip send in your deposit this will hold your space on the trip most companies require 500 or more to reserve your place with part of that sum being non refundable if you cancel begin paying in regular installments check into the billing procedure and keep the customer service billing number close at hand in case you have questions ask if there are any additional fees for paying by credit card realize that most tour companies have a final payment deadline between 45 and 90 days prior to your departure date this is to guarantee all your services especially airfare you risk losing your money if you cancel after this point it is also the reason to sign up for a tour well in advance apply for your passport immediately after you book your trip many states or countries are able to deliver a passport within 6 weeks but it could take up to 3 months check to see if the countries you are visiting require a visa for citizens of your country because some visas take even longer to apply for and receive choose a tour company that does not schedule too many stops at places where goods are manufactured these are often known as commission stops because the company or tour director receives a portion of the money from the goods sold choose a tour that provides the amount of free time you desire this is a personal preference so quiz your tour contact before making a decision they should be able to tell you if your day is completely planned out or if you have afternoons or whole days free look for deals for off season travel in europe this is usually between september and june of the next year take into account that the weather during these months can be less desirable which can be a barrier to people with limited mobility request extra help with airline flights if you need it most tour companies book your travel but you can ask them to list you as being disabled or needing aid if you do not see that listed on your ticket visit the counter on the day of travel to have it added to your boarding pass bring plenty of extra spending money and tip money for your european vacation europe runs on the euro so check the most updated transfer equivalent you can exchange a small amount at the bank and then use an automated teller machine atm to take out the rest once you get there using an atm has the advantage of giving you the current day s exchange rate a small percentage is usually charged by the bank every time you take money out however you should not try to take all your money out at once in case of theft or pick pocketing try to strike a good balance for taking out money every few days or every week buy extremely comfortable travel clothes and shoes pack lightly and plan to wear many of your clothes more than once this will allow you to take a smaller more manageable suitcase and you will leave room for souvenirs buy travel insurance if the company you are traveling with does not provide a good plan then find one yourself it should include an emergency evacuation medical care and anything that can help with chronic health conditions

how to find cheap airfare to europe,finding cheap airfare to europe can seem like a daunting task even in spite of the plethora of internet travel search engines promising you the best deals these search engines can certainly help but finding cheap airfare to europe requires a little more effort than merely that in order to accomplish this goal you must plan ahead but you should also remain flexible on travel dates carriers and additional flight details,plan ahead at minimum you should try booking your flight two to three weeks before you plan on leaving to lock in the best price but booking between six to eight weeks in advance is ideal rising oil prices mean that airlines are also raising their fees and ticket prices are more likely to go up than down as more time passes go during an off season major holidays are busy travel seasons and august tends to be the busiest vacation month for europeans as a result airline tickets increase in price around these dates the cheapest prices to europe tend to fall out in the middle of winter excluding the gap of time between christmas and new years with moderate prices falling out in the spring and fall depart and return in the middle of the week most people fly over the weekend so weekend tickets cost a lot more than tickets with departure dates set in the middle of the week the lowest prices generally fall out on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays fly to london first from london fly to your final destination flights to london are cheaper than flights to other european cities and countries and flights from london to another european destination are also significantly cheaper than flights to that destination from the united states or canada you can usually save money by making these two separate flights instead of flying direct to your final european destination shop around but focus on travel websites that make their money through advertising travel websites that allow you to compare airline prices can help you find the lowest price relatively quickly but some search websites are better than others some websites have an affiliation with certain airlines making their results biased travel websites that make their money via bookings charge airlines a booking commission to display results from their company as a result these websites may not display budget carriers that refuse to pay such a fee websites that make their money through advertising have no reason to filter out results and generally offer the most reliable honest search results search through a wide range of booking websites especially international ones booking websites based in the united states do not often have listings for all the small airlines scattered across europe international booking websites will probably include more of these airlines especially websites based in the region of europe you plan on visiting check out an airline s european websites prices for the same flight can vary depending on where you book it and you can book a flight from another country s website if your favorite airline has a website based in your destination country start there otherwise you can simply search british versions of an airline website and plan on making two separate flights try a charter flight a charter airline leases an airplane for a specific date and route they charge a low price which often dips even lower as the flight date gets closer but the flight can be cancelled at the last moment if they do not sell enough seats to make a profit since flights rely on a large number of passengers this option works best if you plan on flying to a major destination like london paris or rome you may not be able to find a charter flight to a less common european destination buy a consolidator ticket wholesalers sometimes purchase large sums of tickets for flights predicted to sell out in turn they usually sell these consolidator tickets to travelers at a reduced price and still manage to make a profit doing so like charter flights consolidator tickets are easier to find for popular european destinations but harder to find for smaller locations that do not attract much tourism book with secondary airports secondary airports are smaller than primary airports and charge smaller landing fees as a result low cost carriers are more likely to fly from a secondary airport consider a frequent flier program even if you do not fly frequently joining an airline rewards program is a good idea as long as you plan on flying more than once in your life you earn points with each flight involved in the program and with enough points you can earn discounts and free tickets many of these programs can be used with international carriers as well including many european ones sign up for e newsletters and mailing lists to find last minute deals airlines and travel search engines that have e mail mailing lists often send their subscribers information on last minute travel deals many of the available discounts are only offered for a limited time and individuals not subscribed to the mailing list risk not hearing about them in time,Travel

shoes included is good too you never know when you may wind up going on a spontaneous romantic hike leave room for a few souvenirs in general it s good to not load up on cheap souvenirs as cute as many of the just married trinkets can be wherever you go keep in mind that you will put out very few or none of these things in the future that money is better put to having a nice dinner or doing an activity you won t have the opportunity to try for some time that being said you ll probably want a couple of things to remember your trip by so leave a bit of room in your pack just in case postcards are a good small trinket to take back useful too you may also want some food items or other more practical things to take back with you and don t forget gifts for mom and dad buy your honey a honeymoon themed gift for the trip in order to build the excitement for the trip even more have a gift with you to make the vacation extra special it could be something warm for them to wear on the mountainside or something teeny tiny for them to wear in the bedroom whatever it is you ll remember it from your honeymoon and it will have that special place in your heart for years to come

didn t bring my suit or i have nothing to wear surprise you came prepared let the memories commence,Travel

these places are innately romantic you can deepen the romance by booking boutique accommodations frequenting intimate restaurants and visiting historical landmarks and beautiful landscapes that are off the beaten track,schedule a trip in the tourist offseason italy s ancient cities are invariably exciting gorgeous and mysterious but they re also perpetually besieged by flocks of tourists fortunately you can limit the amount of camera toting street clogging tourists disrupting your tete a tete time by booking your stay during the spring or late autumn 1 x research source the peak tourist season is from june to september avoid august in particular as native italians join the hordes of international tourists on holiday and temperatures linger consistently in the 90s book a romantic boutique hotel just because you re going to the bright lights big city doesn t mean you have to book a big generic hotel popular italian metropolises such as venice florence milan and rome are overflowing with boutique hotels where you ll feel all the charm of an italian villa for example the 16th century ca maria adele in venice boasts only twelve rooms and its own private entrance to the grand canal 2 x research source you can also check out alternate accommodation sites such as airbnb or vrbo you and your partner will be all alone together but you ll also be responsible for such prosaic chores as buying groceries cooking and cleaning up after yourselves inquire about special packages or bonuses for couples once you ve selected a hotel for your getaway contact guest services and ask about any exclusive couples specific rates or packages even if they don t offer any discounts for romantic retreats they might provide special extras such as flowers or champagne delivered to the room spa or massage services or custom keepsakes from your stay dine in off the beaten path restaurants and cafes you ve probably heard of such legendary establishments as harry s bar in venice the camparino in galleria in milan or the antico caffe greco in rome while these historic dining and drinking venues are worth a glance the packed noisy atmosphere is less than conducive to an intimate evening so plan instead on eating and drinking at local alternatives for example pop into harry s dolci for a bellini in venice spend an evening at fonderie milanesie in milan or have a glass of wine at the vintage bistrot in rome 3 x research source stroll the shops on ancient winding streets browsing quaint italian shops and finding unique gifts for each other be they vintage knickknacks

atmosphere 5 x research source the same goes for any museums or galleries you re hoping to visit many popular tourist attractions offer late evening or nighttime hours on specific days during the week so check out the late night options before battling the throngs 6 x research source find alternatives to tourist trap destinations when thinking about famously romantic activities in italy you probably envision floating down venetian canals in a gondola sipping wine on a sidewalk caf√© or surveying the cityscape from la pergola restaurant in rome or campanile di san marco tower in venice unfortunately the long lines and steep prices of these attractions can drain the romance right out of your day avoid these popular pitfalls by planning to visit less famous alternatives to these tourist traps for example check out the san giorgio maggiore bell tower in venice rather than the campanile di san marco or venture to the couples friendly local favorite gianicolo hill vista rather than jostling for a table at la pergola 7 x research source plan a route through tuscany or umbria if you re more country mouse than city mouse consider taking a tour through the rolling hills and

some differences that can help you make your choice between them 8 x research source if you re looking for a more off the beaten path experience and overall lower prices head to umbria if you re looking for some beach time and a wine weighty experience go for tuscany 9 x research source book a rental car many tourists take organized bus tours through tuscany or umbria but for a romantic getaway you re better off renting a car for the two of you this way your trip is full of tete a tete quality time as well as easily customizable and flexible use a big rental company like avis hertz

how to hike the pacific crest trail,the pacific crest trail is a national park that runs parallel to the west coast of north america it goes north and south through california oregon washington and ends in british columbia canada all together it is roughly 2 653 miles 4 270 km of serene hiking and views and it is the second largest collection of trails anywhere in the world 1 x research source to hike the entire trail would take roughly 6 months but most people spend less than a week on the trail keep in mind you need to file for the proper permits before going out to hike the pacific crest trail,choose at least one other person to go hiking with you portions of the trail are pretty remote and you could end up in serious danger if you injure an ankle or run into trouble and there s no one around to help you out reach out to a friend or contact a fellow hiking enthusiast to go with you if you don t know any viable candidates go online to a community hiking site or social media group and look for a travel buddy there 2 x research source in parts of the trail it s actually illegal to hike on your own this is entirely for safety reasons there are just too many things that can go wrong if you hike the pacific crest trail alone the pacific crest trail is not an everyday hike in many portions of the trail the going can get pretty rough consider hiking another trail first if this is your first time going hiking pick the direction you want to hike the trail the southern portion of the trail is mostly deserts and rocky terrain then it runs through central and northern california which includes the famous sierra nevada and features dozens of mountains next oregon is mostly flat and filled with forests before washington and british columbia become mountainous again choose the direction you want to go based on the terrain you re looking to experience 3 x research source take the weather into account based on the direction you re going you cannot start a 2 week northbound trip in late august if you re starting off in washington since you ll risk running into snow similarly it s going to be dangerous to try hiking in southern california in the summer check the weather for the area you plan on hiking and try to line your hike up so that you aren t running into terrible temperatures and extreme precipitation 4 x research source check the forecasts in 1 month increments in the time leading up to your hike this will keep you from getting pumped for a hike that probably needs to be rescheduled you can pull up a detailed set of forecasts for each portion of the trail on the pcta s website 5 x research source schedule your hike between april and may if you re northbound over 90 of hikers head out in the early spring and go northbound whether you start out near the mexican border central california or somewhere in oregon or washington the best time to head out is between april and may after the snow melts and the weather warms a little 6 x research source if you re hiking for a long period of time this will make sure you re north by the time the weather gets really hot if you re hiking a short period of time you ll beat the brutal heat in the southern half of the trail by a month or so go hiking in late june or july if you re going south if you re starting in british columbia washington or oregon wait until the late summer to hike south this way you won t be south until the hot weather has dissipated if you re only hiking a short period of time hiking the northern half in the summer will keep you comfortable 8 x research source even in the height of summer the weather in british columbia washington and oregon doesn t get that hot for example seattle averages roughly 73 79 f 23 26 c during july this is not hot enough to wear yourself out on the trail but warm enough to comfortably fall asleep at night stay out of the southern third of the trail in the summer months it will get extremely hot in the desert avoid hiking the north end in the winter and the south end in the summer regardless of when you re going and where you re hiking the ultimate goal is to avoid the northern half in the winter and the southern half in the summer not only is the trail uncomfortable during these times it s extremely dangerous 9 x research source the average low in washington during january is 18 28 f 8 2 c when it s that cold you can t sleep and you re at risk of frost bite hypothermia and freezing to death the average high in southern california during august is around 85 f 29 c but it regularly exceeds 95 f 35 c especially in the desert you d be at risk of dehydration heat stroke and sunburn if you go hiking in this kind of weather buy or find a detailed map of the pacific crest trail you can use an online map while you re planning but you ll need a physical copy when you re out on the trail make sure that you map includes the name of every national park and wilderness area since you ll need these names for permit planning any official trail map should work just fine for this 10 x research source choose a route to hike based on proximity and desired terrain one way to plan your route is to simply start in the area closet to where you live if you re traveling to the region specifically to hike the pacific crest trail you can start wherever you d like based on the type of terrain you re looking to hike much of the trail is mountainous but oregon is mostly forested and the southern end of the trail is mostly desert select a specific route based on where you enjoy hiking 11 x research source some hikers pick an end to start at and hike the entire trail in portions over the course of their lifetime there s no wrong place to start the entire trail is beautiful and you really shouldn t focus too much on finding the best spot just choose a type of terrain you want to see determine how much time it ll take based on how far you want to go with lightweight gear a quick pace and a serious lack of breaks you ll make it 25 30 miles 40 48 km a day under normal conditions though you re probably only going to get 15 20 miles 24 32 km a day sit down and figure out how much time it ll take based on your initial route 12 x research source this is especially important if you re taking time off of work or plan on hiking during a break from school identify the resupply points and adjust your route accordingly there are various towns and shops along the trail identify all of the resupply points in the area where you re planning to hike then shift your starting point up or down so that you reach the first resupply point when you think you ll be down to roughly ¬Ω of your food and water supply this way you ll ensure that you never run dangerously low on food and water 13 x research source many people mail themselves resupply packages along the route so they don t need to spend 1 2 hours shopping at each supply point 14 x research source you can find a complete list of resupply points online 15 x research source the resupply points are kind of designed to be reasonably close to one another if you re hiking in california there are a few stretches in the norther half where you won t find one for 60 100 miles 97 161 km always check your map before leaving a supply point to make sure you have enough food and water identify every park and wilderness area you re hiking through about half of the pacific crest trail requires a permit especially if you re spending the night on it you need permits specifically to enter or camp in designated protected wilderness areas usually shown in green on a map national parks and you need separate permits for california state parks compile a list of every permit restricted area you plan on passing through 16 x research source start applying for permits at least 3 months before your hike you ll need to register them 3 weeks in advance and they can take time to process if you re hiking only through oregon or washington you can get permits at the kiosks where you enter the parks you do not need to worry about permits if you re hiking through these states alone you need your passport if you re doing the entire trail you ll need it to get across the canadian us border go to each individual park agency s website to file for your permits this is where things get a little complicated you need a permit from every park and wilderness agency to hike or camp through it pull up the website for every agency you re traveling through and apply for a permit on their website fill in all of the details and submit your personal information to apply 17 x research source almost all of these permits are free the parks require them so they can monitor how many people are on the trail limit the environmental impact and ensure that there s record of where you are in the event you get lost or go missing in the united states you ll apply for the vast majority of permits on the usa s government recreation page 18 x research source get a california fire permit to cook in the state of california if you re hiking in any portion of california you also need a california fire permit if you plan on cooking any hot meals if you aren t bringing a burner or personal stove don t worry about it otherwise complete an online course and take a quiz to print one off online 19 x research source you can take this class and apply for the permit online 20 x research source the california fire permit does not let you start campfires it only lets you cook hot food on a controlled flame if you plan on setting up any campfires you need to apply for a campfire permit online as well 21 x research source apply for a canada pct permit if you re crossing the border at any point if you plan on hiking from the united states to canada you need a canada pct permit to enter canada the pcta has a special agreement with canada but the permit lets the authorities in canada know that you re coming so they can do a preliminary background check 22 x research source fill out an application online at the pcta s website 23 x research source then email your application to pacificcresttrail cbsa asfc gc ca if you re american or canadian you don t need a special permit to go from canada to the united states you only need your passport you do need a visa if you re a foreign national though pick up your hiking gear 2 3 weeks before your trip get your hiking shoes and boots your paper map a compass and gps unit and all of your weather appropriate clothing you ll also need a flashlight emergency fire kit emergency signal and first aid kit get a tent sleeping bag and sunscreen as well pick up everything you need 2 3 weeks before you plan on heading out to give yourself time to pack and prepare your backpack 24 x research source purchase enough food and water to make it to the first supply point get some high calorie dehydrated food to make sure you have plenty of energy before you reach your first supply point get at least 2 cups 470 ml of water for every hour of hiking you ll be doing include 1 2 2 pounds 230 910 g of food per day pack plenty of snacks and cooking equipment to prepare your food 25 x trustworthy source eatright org organization associated with the academy of nutrition and dietetics providing advice about food health and fitness go to source in addition to dehydrated food include some cereal sauce packets

of the trail 26 x research source watch your footing while you re out and stay on the trail pay attention to where you re walking especially if you re in a mountainous area if you lose your footing

make sure you re heading the right way while you hike 27 x research source abandon the hike if you re injured or the weather gets too rough if you get injured it s key that you get help as soon as possible if something goes wrong on the hike you can t just power through without risking your life similarly if a storm pins you in place for more than a few hours you probably need to abandon the

it can be stressful uncomfortable and unpleasant good planning and preparation will make your holiday much more comfortable and relaxing,pack light it sounds simple but it is really important if you will be carrying your luggage from one place to another expect to travel in buses taxis trains and on foot and through airports and hotels it really makes a difference if your stuff is easy to carry don t take anything that isn t strictly necessary shoes can be heavy and take up lots of room try to take only one or two pairs and remember that the streets will be dirty it s good to take an older pair for around town and a light pair flip flops are good for evenings if you can keep your luggage to one carry on sized bag you may be able to avoid having to check anything or leave any bags in a bag deposit you will also have an easier time getting around make sure your luggage is strong and easy to transport bear in mind that your bags will be tossed around a lot in airports train stations etc it needs to be sturdy or you will find yourself buying new bags which though cheap won t last long though good bags are expensive it s worth investing a little at the start to avoid lots of spending later and much inconvenience whatever bags you take make sure you can transport them easily yourself if you are getting new bags consider getting them with wheels so that they are easy to move from one place to another though surfaces may not be entirely smooth it makes life easier on the other hand consider getting bags small enough and keeping them light enough not to need wheels wheels add weight and bulk to a bag and you may find yourself navigating tiled uneven sidewalks cobblestone streets stairs and even unpaved surfaces consider using a rucksack backpack or lightweight shoulder bag instead of a suitcase update your immunizations before you leave a few countries require vaccinations for entry many others recommend vaccinations take insect repellent containing deet and use it especially if you will be traveling in any rural or jungle area some parts of south america such as high in the andes mountains are free of mosquitoes and other insects that carry disease many more areas are at risk for insect borne diseases including dengue yellow fever and malaria it is best to avoid being exposed take an electrical adapter or purchase one when you arrive if you take electrical appliances hair dryers camera charger laptop you will need an electrical adapter remember that the voltage and frequency hertz or hz may also be different from what you have at home if it is you may need an adapter that includes a transformer or converter not just a plug that fits check the labels on the devices you will use to see if they can accept different electricity supplies cut out or cut down on electrical devices if you don t really need them to reduce weight and minimize the damage in case your luggage gets lost always carry toilet paper with you in many toilets in south america toilet paper is not provided taking a wad with you from your hotel ensures that you won t be left without also it s easy to catch a cold at high altitude if you re not used to it using toilet paper is cheaper and easier than carrying around packets of tissues and it means you can top up every evening from your hotel take plenty of layers weather in south america can vary so it s easier if you take layers of clothes that you can put on and off a light raincoat is good for wet weather these days it is easy to get macs that pack up nice and small long sleeved t shirts or light jumpers are better than thick sweaters but remember that it is unlikely you ll need more than one or two outer layers wash underwear yourself hotel washing can be very expensive and difficult if you re only there for one night it is far easier to wash knickers and socks while you shower then hang them up to dry overnight if wrung out thoroughly they will be dry by morning so that you can have clean underwear every day without taking lots of pairs if you have a bit more time you can wash other clothing by hand too or you can use a laundromat lavender√≠a or hotel laundry service wear sun cream at high altitude if you re traveling in the andes even in the winter it is easy to get sunburn though it may still feel cold put sun cream on your face to protect it take some energy bars or snacks these are handy if you get hungry while traveling it may be difficult to get food if you re in a remote area or traveling by coach use hotel safes these usually have little or no extra charge and are much better than carrying valuables around town with you use a money belt or similar and take precautions to avoid pickpockets when you must carry your passport credit card or the like use interior pockets or a money belt to keep them out of sight and out of reach do not set bags down in restaurants internet cafes or the like and do not leave bags unattended or hang them over the back of a chair these areas are frequent targets for pickpockets don t wear expensive jewelry take earplugs many hotel rooms face noisy streets use internet cafes in many places web cafes are abundant and inexpensive you may be able to avoid carrying a laptop around which in turn will eliminate the possibility of loss or theft in argentina look for the word locutorio to identify web cafes these shops often have public telephones and they may have basic post office services too,Travel

including dealing with your property car pets insurance packing and shipping banking educational transitions and more in some cases you may not have this luxury it is possible to move quickly so if this has been thrust on you try not to despair however do immediately spend time creating networks of helpers you really need as many hands on deck as you can gather consider looking for accommodation in the new country as soon as possible will you stay in hotel or serviced apartment accommodation while looking for a place to buy or rent 4 x research source avoid buying a place over the internet

back to your home country and buy up or have understanding family and friends send you care packages while for many people the lack of choice does not really fade with time you will find yourself reminiscing frequently about the days when you could get x item in x different styles but you do get used to fewer choices be ready for the bloom to fade after a few months initially the first few months will feel like an amazing vacation and you will spend a lot of it discovering things and feeling excited however eventually you will realize that you live there and it is not half as exciting as you thought for some this realization can hit sooner rather than later as bureaucracy household maintenance issues and minor crises interrupt the flow of settling in early on ask about decent tradespeople eventually something is going to break in addition you are going to need someone reliable who turns up when they say they will and who charges fairly if you have not already lined up such people through asking others who do know you are fair game for being taken advantage of and overcharged this can be a nightmare experience and since you have the freedom to plan rather than wait for the ax to fall plan stay calm when dealing with bureaucratic procedures most countries have forms most have queues and most have the most insanely ridiculous reasons for filling out things and waiting yours is not to question why but to learn via locals and online sites how to manage these issues as best as possible there is always a way be sure to learn about the right way if you do not ask you will never know be ready to accept limits on your usual routines and ways of doing things another form of culture shock is learning what you cannot do even though you could do in your old country you are not in a position to question it reach an acceptance that this is how things are whether the society you have gone to is more or less permissive than what you are used to be sure to do the right thing to fit in if you wanted to create a ruckus or take a stand then moving overseas is not the right way about it stay home for that get support moving countries is right up there at the top of the

brazil they naturally take everything easy and go at a slower rate at first it will seem strange but after getting used to it you ll never want to go to the harried pace that s overtaken the west try the food feijoada black beans and pork stew and churrasco all you can eat barbecue are sure bets in the state of minas gerais try dozens of kinds of cheese with doce de leite custard like paste and homemade jams craving a taste of the west ordered a pizza while the pizza in brazil is very very good it s also different it will come with olive oil drizzled on top and mayo and ketchup for dipping it can also be hard to find traditional western toppings such as pepperoni however this is a good chance to try more unusual toppings do not always buy snacks at the beach because there s a possibility of food poisoning on the other hand drinking in public on the beaches is perfectly normal and allowed get the dress right in rio you ll likely see fabulous colors donned by both men and women though women in particular but in the south and in the interior of the country people tend to be a bit more conservative if you re in a business setting wear a full suit if you re a man or a women for women skirts are acceptable this is true even if it s a whopping 43 c 110 f and in church or government buildings don t wear shorts tank tops flip flops or a miniskirt you won t be allowed in but everywhere else just about everything goes let your body acclimate don t always turn the air conditioning on if you have it the more your body experiences the heat the easier it will be to take the extreme heat and humidity can tire a person very quickly allowing your body to adjust to the different weather is important for thriving in brazil don t cross the street just yet pedestrians do not have the right of way especially in larger cities those crosswalks and signs you re seeing most of those are considered as decorations to the drivers always be on the lookout you may not necessarily be stopped for avoid the commuter hours if you can whether you re on foot in a car or using public transit imagine la or new york at 5 pm and that s brazil more often than not if you need to get somewhere by a specific time allow a lot of extra time for traffic this also means you ll be dealing with loads and loads of pollution at least in the big cities plan rural escapes to get away and literally get a breath of fresh air when you need it take up futebol dancing and christianity the average brazilian has three religions futebol dancing and christianity deadline at work it can wait until the game is over friday night they ll be out dancing at their favorite club and as for when things get tough 88 of them turn to a christian god if you want to be in the mind of a brazilian try out these 3 things take time out to go to a game go dancing and participate in a mass you ll fit right in for the record 73 of brazilians are catholic and 15 of brazilians are protestant catholic also encompasses regional religions like umbanda and candomble they don t literally have three religions these are just three things brazilians really really really take to heart brazil would not be the same without any one of these three ways of life if invited to a brazilian s house follow brazilian etiquette it s traditional to bring the hostess flowers or a small gift orchids are considered a very nice gift but make sure to avoid purple ones in fact avoid giving the host anything purple or black these are mourning colors don t give handkerchiefs either they are associated with funerals and do not make good gifts for the record the gifts will be opened when received right in front of you 2 x research source be at least a half hour late when they say come over for dinner at 7 30 they don t mean it even an hour late is fine they likely won t be ready for you anyway don t feel the need to worry or plan whatever it is brazilians are notoriously chill have a deadline at work no big deal if you re late two hours late to dinner no problem that s normal need to get something done wait till the last minute and then rely on your luck brazilians do and they call it jogo de cintura they believe that everything will be fine in the end 3 x research source the hardest part of this won t be doing it yourself it ll be remembering that everyone else does it when you make plans with a friend you ll have to keep in mind that they won t be on time it s easy to get frustrated sure however you will get on brazilian time eventually know that in brazil gender roles are fairly traditional expat women generally find it harder to adapt to brazilian culture than men there s a large machismo culture in brazil which most men don t find too hard to adapt to however women are largely expected to take on submissive traditional roles 4 x research source needless to say brazil can still make strides in its gender equality if you re a woman think about this is it something you can deal with it s not the middle east but it will be something you have to put up with if you re used to a more gender equal lifestyle be prepared for lots of paperwork and bureaucracy need to get your visa renewed give it a few weeks and don t be surprised if it s difficult to get back there s generally a lot of red tape when dealing with official paperwork and as you ve seen brazilians don t care much for a sense of urgency this is another aspect of the don t worry about it mentality it s the same for the government as long as you give everything more than adequate time you should be fine in the paperwork arena try to account for lateness when possible expect the way you spend money to be very different many expats make a good living in brazil being able to afford at home help and taking trips often and often overseas however there are a few differences in brazilian culture and believe it or not some things will be more expensive stock up on your children s toys outside of the country they are in general around four times as much due to duties and demand ref have a bit of money on hand for the parking people or flanelinha this is the guy that s ushered your car to its spot if even that you may see him pop up next to your window never having seen him before but everyone pays them anyway it keeps the economy moving be ready to see lots of plastic surgery think america is bad brazil has embraced plastic surgery with open arms and no one is ashamed in fact they ll likely let you know what you should get done too they re fairly open about their opinions on your weight hair and look too if they think they have a good idea to make you more attractive they ll likely let you know try your best not to take it personally they do mean well in their own way embrace what you approve of assimilating to a culture s ways is a very important part of feeling like you fit in and feeling at home embrace their traditions and etiquette to get a feel for their way of life and to truly experience the country however if something doesn t make sense to you don t do it you still have your own mind no culture is better than any other and therefore their way of life doesn t necessarily have to be adopted take traffic rules for example if you see a pedestrian timidly crossing the street you may wish to resist that brazilian influence growing inside of you and let him or her pass never compromise safety or your happiness just to fit in look for expat communities to be a part of going to brazil on your own can at least initially be very daunting to make the transition easier find other expats to help pad the culture shock they are going through the same thing or have at one point or another they can point you to all the wonderful bits of home they ve cultivated brazil is huge and multicultural you ll be able to find certain comforts brand names certain foods etc if you know where to look make friends who are locals in addition to expat friends you need native friends too to show you the ropes they ll know all the happening spots the best places to get food and show you a side of the country that expats aren t able to they ll be the ones that give you the most memorable stories too don t know where to start you can meet people hanging out at cafes clubs at futbol games or through your students if you teach them your language what s more some families love taking in foreigners next time a friendly looking older woman smiles at you initiate a conversation just by saying hello and asking her name you may be a few minutes away from a home cooked meal take a breather when you need many expats take trips back home often or at least take many opportunities to travel the pollution may get to you if you re in a bigger city so you ll literally need some fresh air listen to your body and mind when are things starting to get to you it s then that you need to take a break from life that way you can come back rejuvenated and ready to go if brazil does start getting to you sleep on it don t write it off quite yet sometimes homesickness seems like it s staying forever but it can be fought through the rewards stories and memories will be virtually limitless if you stay,Travel

country and living arrangements encourage the children to look for all the good aspects as well and share your ideas together pack a ready to be home box this should be the last box on the removal truck and the first one out have each child place a favourite toy book bed item and wall decoration in this box add any other elements that you feel say our home the moment that you put them on the wall or in the house somewhere the moment your goods arrive take this box and remove all the contents immediately each child can put their special home items in their rooms and you can decorate the

pitfalls associated with each destination preparing you for the challenges and excitement ahead find contacts living abroad if you have friends or family in a foreign country that can make the transition much easier try asking your family members or friends who have traveled or hosted foreign guests whether they know anyone in the regions you are considering keep in mind does your family have a cultural attachment to a certain region even if you are not in contact with any family overseas you may decide to narrow down your options to your ancestors region of origin to learn more about family history and traditions decide how important the language barrier is are you up to the difficult and possibly isolating task of living in a country where you don t speak the language find out how many people speak english or another language you understand in the locations you are considering even if you have taken classes in a foreign language be aware that regional accents faster everyday conversation and slang can make it tougher to understand than you expect keep in mind that the language situation may vary within a country for example rural areas are more likely to be monolingual than cities take language lessons from a book recording or teacher before you leave if possible or practice your language skills in conversation think about how often you ll be visiting home some expats live just a train ride away from their home country while other are on the other side of the globe if you travel to another continent realize you ll probably need to pay large sums of money and spend many hours on an airplane in order to visit home if you are departing from or heading to an area with no airport that trip could require days or weeks instead how likely is it that you ll return home for a visit and what kind of expense in time or money will you be willing to spend for that trip consider costs of living if you are traveling to a city you may find your destination in

levels and ease of contact with the outside world may also influence your decision 2 x research source if you wish to use specialized job skills abroad but do not yet have a job finding a region where your job skills are in demand is especially important find an international professional organization if possible to find contacts who have worked abroad in your field and ask them for advice about

greatly get your family on board if you have a family traveling with you make sure they will be comfortable as well are there schools where your children will feel welcome and have their language use accommodated are there any concerns your spouse has about his or her own job prospects comfort or safety other members of your family can use this same step by step guide to identify possible challenges go on a fact finding trip if you are still not sure where you want to live and you have the time and money you could travel to your possible destinations and see firsthand whether you would like to live there try to spend at least three or four weeks in each destination to get a more accurate idea of what life there is like 3 x research source also consider what standard of living you d be able to maintain on a permanent basis a stay in a hotel may not tell you much if you would actually be moving in with a local family try to interact with locals and see how they live their lives and where they spend their time investigate study abroad options if you are a student this option is only available to students or possibly to recent graduates study abroad programs are among the easiest ways to visit another country long term since your lodging will be arranged for you and you will meet people through enrollment in a foreign university while the visit typically lasts a semester or an academic year it can give you a thorough introduction to another country and may teach you more about whether you want to become a permanent expatriate study abroad options may be available through your university secondary school or high school or through third party organizations financial aid may also be available ask a school counselor for more information if you are currently applying to universities consider applying to foreign universities as well make sure they offer classes in a language you speak before applying learn about programs through the military or government if you work for the military or a government institution your nation may pay you for overseas assignments if your country s diplomatic office is hiring you could even enter a new overseas career but be aware that this requires extensive training if you are a member of the u s military or a u s government employee find more information through the the united states federal travel website enroll in a teach abroad program most overseas teaching organizations require an undergraduate degree 4 x research source however this does not necessarily have to be in education if you speak english fluently that alone could make you high demand without any foreign language experience required search for teaching abroad programs online and ask them which teaching certification they require some programs may pay for your certification over the course of a few weeks or months and then assist you in your travel plans volunteer in a foreign country many humanitarian organizations

find a location you can rent on a month to month basis while you investigate long term options for an even more comfortable transition although an expensive one stay in a hotel for the first week or two after you move while you investigate the rental options in person it is still a good idea to research possibilities beforehand and let the landlords know when you ll make a decision pack clothes

required to pack medicine in a clear plastic bag if traveling by plane or pack non vital medicine in your shipped luggage exact regulations vary by country pack a few familiar objects even if you tend to pack light a long term or permanent move could call for more packing than you re used to favorite books in your native language a sentimental object or some other reminder of home may make it

stuff as you can or have friends and family members store your excess possessions international shipping can be expensive especially if you are moving overseas in many cases it may be cheaper to purchase a new item at your destination pack a few boxes or pieces of furniture that you are unsure about and store them in a rented storage space or at a friend s label them clearly and ask a friend to ship these boxes once you ve settled in if you decide you need the contents of a particular box after all understand what culture shock is when you first arrive in a foreign country you might feel

or confusion try to figure out why do locals react the same way and if not why is this considered more normal here you don t need to throw away your moral compass but you will be happier if you spend less time judging other people and more time trying to understand their motivations and cultural pressures learn the language if you intend to stay in a country long term putting in the effort to learn the language of everyday activity is worth it this can feel slow and painful even if you ve studied the language before but it is also an exciting opportunity you are surrounded by fluent speakers and while language lessons books and recordings are still excellent resources you can also practice your language by going shopping attending a concert or introducing yourself to your neighbors make local friends there s only so much you can figure out on your own making friends with people who grew up in the area and have lived there many years can help greatly if you accidentally offend someone or if you go through a confusing experience a local friend can explain the situation and teach you how to deal with it in future talk openly and honestly once you have gotten to know

experiences and reminisce about your times back home 15 x research source just be sure to balance this out with time spent among locals as well or you might find it tempting to stay in an expat bubble and stop interacting with the local culture treat your homesickness maintain contact with friends and family back home with regular phone conversations letters or emails have a few mementos from home such as goodbye cards or a favorite book and look at them when you re feeling down if you can t shake the homesickness or you are shutting yourself in your room at every opportunity you may wish to seek counseling or ask a friend to pull you out of your rut and take you to a hike dance or other activity you would enjoy ask for care packages from home if you have family or friends back home ask them to ship you snacks a new book that just came out in your country or other treats you aren t able to purchase in your adopted country 16 x research source if you do not order yourself these treats online saving up for international shipping if you need to these can be a great way to cheer up after feeling homesick or overwhelmed acquire a daily routine ideally this routine should include exercise sleep and an adequate healthy diet but while most of us know this reduces stress it isn t always easy to follow a rigorous plan like this finding a stable habit you can return to each day can

mail your packages you ll just have to take a deep breath and join the crowd this isn t always an easy thing to do but either you adjust a bit to the new culture or you simply won t be able to function as well as you would like anticipate culture shock and have effective strategies to deal with it when it arises when you are fresh off of the airplane you will be very excited and enthusiastic about the adventure you are about to have in a foreign land everything about your new country will seem exotic new and wonderful this is known by some as the rose coloured glasses phase

might decide that you re sick and tired of this country and you want to go home only you can t go home this is called culture shock it is completely normal and there are many others who have gone through it before some people try to cope with culture shock by re creating their home country they try to only associate with people from their country they only cook foods from their culture and eat at restaurants that serve this familiar food they want their children only to play with other children from their country this strategy is destined to fail repeat this mantra to yourself i cannot recreate my home country and i will only make myself and others unhappy if i try there isn t a lot you can do about the feelings you have and you certainly can t totally control your environment what you can do is control your actions try hard not to complain complaining only reinforces your negative feelings find ways to vent your feelings for example mow your yard mow your neighbor s yard work out pray volunteer your time etc find things about your new country that you like this may seem obvious but just remember your new country is not your home country their customs are not based on the tradition you are used to even though their customs may sometimes seem difficult or silly to you this is how things have been done for a long time there and they aren t going to change for you find things about your new country that you like this is especially effective if these things cannot be found in your home country if you admire a unique aspect of your country s food culture or lifestyle make sure you get out there and enjoy it and remember that the experience wouldn t be possible if you were back at home for example if you are living in japan you might find that the sushi you can find there is better than anything you could ever pick up where you used to live even little things like that can help you adjust to culture shock be patient with yourself and others love yourself
