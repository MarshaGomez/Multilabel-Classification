how to win at kick ups,kick ups which is also known as keepie uppies is the practice of juggling a soccer ball with the feet thighs and head it s a great way to practice ball control and is a workout too winning in competitive kick ups with friends or teammates requires consistent practice and using techniques like watching the ball getting into a cycle and knowing where the ball is going to go you can get good at the basics first solidify your skills and style and then focus yourself for the win,bounce the ball on your thigh although soccer primarily uses the feet beginners at kick ups should master using the thighs first because it s a bit easier than foot juggling the ball should hit the flat surface of the thigh not anywhere on the knee drop the ball to the thigh bounce it once and catch it do this for enough reps to get the motion down before going for multiple bounces use the bridge of your foot on the laces when the thighs are mastered incorporate the feet drop the ball and make contact with it where the toes start keep your toes pointed slightly up so that the ball bounces up rather than forward if you straighten your toes out to point forward the ball is more likely to bounce away from you start with one bounce at a time off your foot making sure the ball goes straight up when you get good at keeping the ball straight go for more kicks in a row start using your non dominant foot most people have a dominant foot and it s easier to let that foot do all the work but the players who are best at kick ups will be equally strong with both feet once you get good with your dominant foot begin practicing just as hard with your other foot this will give your dominant foot a break during competitive kicks ups and give you more options to get a pattern going launch the ball up to your head using either your foot or thigh kicking the ball with just the right amount of power up to your head is tricky and takes time to perfect when you kick the ball into the air it should be just out in front of your head so that you have to lean slightly forward to hit it the ball should bounce off the flat part of your head rather than your forehead work to hit the ball straight up off your head rather than forward or backward moving the ball from your foot to your head may be a little easier than from your thigh to your head because you can get more power with your foot practice consistently beating others at kick ups means being consistently better than them which is only achieved by practicing you should practice kick ups techniques every day to build the strength in your legs and to form muscle memory for the motion juggling the ball takes one way to practice is to set a certain time limit for which you must work on the skills and then increase this time a little bit every day try to go for 10 seconds straight or for 10 reps without dropping the ball set a goal like this and then as you reach it set a new slightly higher goal find the motion that works best for you being comfortable with juggling will help you win kick ups more often so if a certain way of moving feels better do it that way some people like to move the foot at the ankle to pop the ball up while others prefer slightly extending the knee to kick at the ball you can even move your bent leg up and down at the hip 1 x research source try using each approach for a few minutes and see which feels the most natural to you then get proficient at that style do drills to get the technique just right you can t start out with the goal of getting 50 bounces on the first try on a hard surface bounce the ball off the ground and kick it up once into your hands drop it again and kick it twice with a bounce in between before catching it then kick it twice with no bounce and catch it this progression will help get the exact motion right before going for too long 2 x research source you want the ball to go straight up after the kick without too much spin so if you do one kick and it doesn t go straight up stay on that step of the drill until you can kick it straight up this gives you a foundation to build on you can build on this basic drill by passing it from one foot to the other going from foot to head back to thigh or do 10 reps on the foot then 10 on the thigh then 10 on the head the goal of drills is to get the technique right on a few reps before trying for the most reps watch the ball it may feel like keeping your eye on the ball makes you seem weak but it is the most effective way to keep the ball going you may think your foot or leg was positioned perfect for a pass up to your head but watching the ball will help you know for sure where the ball goes will tell you whether or not you got the technique right 3 x research source you can practice juggling the ball without looking to push yourself but when you are playing to win watching will give you an added edge on your opponent focus on your balance kick ups requires you to be on one foot for an extended period of time so having exceptional balance is a useful aspect to master if you are wobbling all over the place with each kick you will have less control of where the ball goes work hard to maintain upright posture and only move enough to keep the ball moving 4 x research source a good way to practice is just standing on one foot for as long as you can while staying up straight and not swaying once you can stand still for a long time you ll be able to practice the movement of kicking move the ball through a pattern some people playing kick ups move the ball around at random and are constantly reacting to wherever the ball goes you can win by having greater control than your opponent move the ball in a pattern using each body part if you move the ball in a pattern you ll know exactly where it is going rather than guessing 5 x research source a good pattern might be right foot left foot left thigh right thigh head or you could go up the right side and down the left side by cycling right foot right thigh head left thigh left foot the goal is planning ahead where you are passing the ball to,Sports-and-Fitness

regular clients you ll be able to remember what they respond well to watch for clients who seem to be struggling if you notice a person or group of people who seem to be falling behind go out of your way to encourage them pay attention to and respond to their reaction if they want to be pushed hard help them along but if they don t like the extra attention let them exercise at their own pace

event encourage teams if there are lots of kids or if the adults would like to join in have each team develop its own mascot give them paper stuffed toys markers etc to do this with set out an area with soft mats for anyone who is good at gymnastics or who simply wants to try out some cartwheels and handstands award the children with medals for their wins these could be made from cardboard paper etc attached to ribbon or you could use chocolate coins attached to a ribbon hold an olympics trivia quiz some of the party guests might enjoy testing their wits about all things olympic there are several possible approaches to this run a pub style quiz that only uses the olympics for the subject matter play trivial pursuit but replace the cards with your own olympic themed ones this would be a

supply to be adjusted before it gets to the motor make sure that this adaptor is in place and plugged in properly some models may need to be opened to complete this step if this is the case be sure to unplug your treadmill before opening any electrical boxes unplug the treadmill from its electrical source in order to check for other problems you will need to unplug the treadmill for safety check your treadmill fuses if the fuses are blown your treadmill will not start luckily a blown fuse is usually a quick and easy fix you can check your fuses with a multi meter or take them to a local electronics store for testing 1 x research source if your fuses are blown be sure to replace them with fuses that are that have the same amperage rating 2 x research source determine whether the problem is at the display if your machine won t turn on it may just be that the screen of your treadmill is not working make sure that all of the wires between the treadmill and the display are secure also check that you are getting power to the display you can check this by using your multi meter at the connection points between the power coming in and the display 3 x research source consult a professional repair person if you are unable to find the problem with the previous steps you may need to consult a professional if available contact the manufacturer for information on further diagnostics to perform and for a list of qualified repair shops in your area troubleshoot running belt issues determine whether the problem is with the belt itself or a mechanical issue with the belt drivers making this determination will help you make your next step if the problem is with the belt itself you may be able to make repairs relatively easily yourself motor or mechanical issues may be more difficult to fix at home unplug your treadmill when making repairs on your treadmill it is very important to make sure it is unplugged so that it does not accidentally get turned on and injure you clean the surface of the treadmill belt spray a towel with a cleaning solution and wipe down the belt dirt and debris can collect on the belt which can slow it down debris can also drop from the belt into the interior of the treadmill causing operating problems 4 x research source begin cleaning at the top of the belt and tug the belt firmly to move it downward until you have cleaned the entire surface be sure to let the surface get really dry before you use the machine a wet belt could cause you to slip and injure yourself center the treadmill belt adjust the belt so that it is centered in the machine belts can stretch and begin to lean to one side after frequent use you can try repositioning the belt from the outside of the treadmill by pulling gently away from the slanted side 5 x research source if the problem is severe a technician should look at the issue lubricate the belt if the belt on your treadmill hesitates when you step on it you may need to lubricate it this reduces belt friction and can lengthen the life of the belt buy treadmill belt lubricant or any silicone lubricant spray lubricant in a thin layer between the belt and the treadmill deck 6 x research

how to play horse the basketball game,horse is a really fun game that every basketball player or kid with a backyard hoop can enjoy horse is a basketball shooting game where players take turns shooting at the hoop from different locations if someone makes a shot but everyone else misses those people get a letter toward the word horse the last person left standing wins get your best trick shots ready because horse is a great chance to show them off you ll need at least two players but there s no limit to the number of players who can join in,decide on an order of play you can play horse with two or more players but you must agree on an order for who plays first then second and so on try flipping a coin or playing rock paper scissors to figure out who gets to choose the order if you can t decide take turns shooting from the same spot the first person to make a basket can choose their position continue this process until the order has been sorted 1 x research source start with the first player taking a shot at the hoop the first player can take a shot from anywhere on the court or even from out of bounds they can add extra rules to this shot too but they have to announce them before shooting for example the player can say i m shooting with my eyes closed or i m shooting behind my back they get one attempt to make the basket if a rule is called and the player succeeds in shooting the ball in but they don t satisfy all the rules of the shot they stated the shot doesn t count 2 x research source let the next player attempt to either match the shot or create a new one the second player in the order is now given the opportunity to shoot they either have to create a new shot or attempt to copy the shot that was just made by the player in front of them if the first player made a basket then the second player has to copy whatever the first player did including where they were standing if the first player missed the basket then the second player can shoot from anywhere using any rules they want to invent 3 x research source keep playing through and attempting new shots whenever it s your turn if the person before you made a basket you have to copy their shot exactly if the person before you missed it s your turn to invent a new shot the order works in a loop so once the final player has taken their shot the ball goes back to the first player 4 x research source get a letter when you fail a shot challenge if someone attempts the shot made by the person before them and they miss the basket they get the letter h each time someone makes this mistake they get a new letter eventually spelling out h o r s e when you spell out the full horse you lose the game when attempting a shot after a letter has been given you do not receive a letter for missing if you miss the basket play just passes to the next player with no penalty 5 x research source you can also play so that a player gains a letter each time everyone else fails a challenge in this version the first to get the word horse wins invent a new shot if everyone succeeds if you invent a shot and every other player successfully makes the basket you get to invent a new shot here it s a great idea to try and make the shots more challenging if everyone made the shot the first time around 6 x research source play until there s one person left when someone spells out the word horse with their letters that player leaves the game the other players keep playing in the same order but skip the eliminated player s turn eventually there will be one player left in the game after everyone else has been eliminated this person is the winner 7 x research source take a no look shot if things are a bit too easy and no one is receiving letters you can kick things up a notch by attempting some crazy shots one of the best ways to start this off is with a no look shot 8 x research source to get this shot in take a good look at the hoop and visualize where you plan on shooting the ball before you close your eyes if you manage to get it in you ll have a very high chance of putting a letter on your opponents shoot while sitting down this shot is really difficult because you use your lower body to assist you when you shoot normally this means that when sitting down the only power you can get is from your arms 9 x research source there isn t a whole lot you can do to give yourself a better chance of shooting it in here simply aim for a nice regular arc and use the backboard perform a behind the back shot this shot is fairly straightforward to attempt but very difficult to succeed at with one arm wrap the ball around your back and flick it up towards the hoop 10 x research source try and use your legs to assist you in getting some power for this shot as otherwise you are only using your hands arms and it becomes even more difficult try shooting with the opposite hand most people favor one hand over the other and this trick shot tests your ability with your weaker hand set up like you normally would and give your best attempt but it s usually very difficult 11 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to improve reaction speed,whether you want to ensure safe driving in poor conditions or improve your reaction time in a competitive sport working on your reflexes is a great habit to keep up throughout your life it s a fun one too you can start by just playing brain and video games for mental flexibility then move on to working your body with ball and agility drills you can even work with a sports specialist to create a particular training regimen get ready to start impressing friends family and yourself with your cat like reflexes,test your reaction speed by having a friend drop a card cut a piece of cardstock so that it s about 8 inches 20 cm long and 2 inches 5 1 cm wide ask a friend to hold it vertically by the top line up your fingers with the bottom edge of the card and ask your friend to drop the card without warning when the card is dropped grab the card with your fingers as quickly as you can this will show you how quickly you re able to react if you grab the card near the bottom you likely have good reaction speed if you grab the card near the top or miss it completely you may have poor reaction speed 1 x research source try ball drills if you are practicing for a sport this is a great way to work your athletic skills and reflexes at the same time play a game of catch kick around a soccer ball or practice another sport related drill you could also get creative and use the ball for a different sport add more partners to make for an extra challenge for example if you are a baseball catcher have your partner throw the ball behind you and then see how fast you can turn around and retrieve it 2 x research source give juggling a try the balls flying through the air forces you to think and act quickly to catch them practicing regularly can decrease your response time and increase your speed and give you a great party trick too 3 x research source you can also use a reaction ball this small six sided ball will move in unpredictable ways when bounced or thrown try agility drills place a few cones at a distance apart and run between them as fast as you can switch up the position of the cones or run in a different way to mix things up if you are playing a sport ask your coach to suggest some specific agility drills that you can do they ll be impressed with your dedication and even more impressed with the results 4 x research source for example try weaving through the spaces between each cone on your first run in your second run weave through every other space work on balance exercises improving your balance can help to improve your reflexes try sitting on a yoga ball with just one foot on the floor standing on one leg and hopping to the other leg or passing a ball from hand to hand while standing on one leg these exercises will all strengthen your balancing abilities you can also try balancing things on your head or your fingertip this will train you to continuously adjust your balance so that you don t drop the item perform eye exercises sometimes it s not your body that s lagging it s your eyes to get them up to speed choose two similar objects and place one nearby and another at a distance rotate between the two trying to read each of them you can also ask your eye doctor for other exercises 5 x research source you can also discuss eye agility training with a sports vision specialist to find a doctor near you go to the american optometric association s website and do a doctor search 6 x research source practice making quick decisions in your everyday life try to consciously speed up your decision making if you feel yourself delaying or taking too much time tell yourself faster faster until you make a final move repeating this process will also help you to get used to the stress associated with quick decisions and learn how to keep your cool under pressure a good skill no matter how fast your reflexes get to be 7 x research source try playing some online games where you have to make quick decisions the timer in these games will force you to think faster in order to maintain a high score learn to speed read this one almost feels like a game time yourself as you read single pages to see how long it takes to make it through then see if you can cut down the seconds while still comprehending the material do this with a variety of types of reading to keep your mind flexible you can also take a speed reading course online or at a local college soon you ll be cutting down on both your reaction times and your study sessions 8 x research source another way to practice speed reading is to glance through a page and mark out a single letter at a time so take a pencil and cross out every a on a single page do the same with other letters until you feel your speed increasing remember to erase the marks when you re done if others want to enjoy the book play brain games there are a number of sites online that offer brain training mix it up to avoid training the same way over and over again or your mind will adapt and you ll lose your edge instead try some old fashioned brain training methods such as playing cards or a computer game 9 x research source you can also look at a sequence of numbers and try to memorize them then see how long you can remember the numbers and write them back down correctly pick your friends and family members phone numbers so you can work on your reflexes and memorize their contact information at the same time play video games get a game console and some action video games and play for 30 minutes a day the fast paced nature of the gaming can increase your brain s ability to process information the gaming environment may also force you to get used to making quick decisions based on limited information 10 x research source in case you needed even more motivation to play video games studies say that people who play action video games show an up to 25 percent speed increase in decision making when compared to people who do not play chew something get a pack of gum and chew it when you know you need to be quick or grab a handful of sunflower seeds it has been suggested that chewing stimulates the muscles in your mouth and jaw which then send additional blood and activity up to your brain you only need to chew for 10 seconds for an initial effect to occur and you ll get a boost for at least 15 minutes enjoy the burst of flavor too 11 x research source the benefits of this step are often not viewable to the naked eye and are measured in milliseconds of difference however for athletes in particular shaving down even small amounts of time can have a positive effect recognize the importance of speed as coaches always say get your head in the game sit and think about how you need to be fast and accurate in your upcoming task mentally go through all of the preparations that you have done approaching a task in a calm precise manner can help you to harness your stress nerves and put them to good use 12 x research source reminding yourself that you are in control can also lower the possibility of mistakes born out of nervousness such as jumping the starting line minimize distractions if you are working on something that requires concentration and speed try to eliminate all other things that might grab your attention for example if you are driving in bad conditions and need to react quickly turn off the radio and talk less with the car s passengers they won t mind the quiet if they know their driver is taking good care of them 13 x research source you can also combine this with other speed exercises too for example if you are playing a video game minimize the distractions in your room so that you can focus exercise to stay mentally and physically quick you must take care of yourself exercise at least 3 times a week or more if possible exercise increases blood flow to your entire body including your brain your body will thank you with speedier reaction times and plenty of endorphins 14 x research source if you are not used to exercising work your way up with shorter simpler exercises start with a 15 to 30 minute walk then move on to jogging or swimming eat right eat healthy balanced and consistent meals eating right gives your body the fuel needed to perform at its best work some eggs and spinach into your diet they re super foods for the brain both containing the amino acid tyrosine which has been shown to increase reaction speeds 15 x research source conversely drinking alcohol or using illegal substances can slow your reaction speeds down get enough sleep if you are tired you ll respond sluggishly no matter how well you eat or exercise make sure to get at least 8 hours of good solid undisturbed sleep a night this will allow you to stay alert for longer periods 16 x research source how much sleep you need will depend on your personal needs typically this will be between 7 and 9 hours don t get too much sleep either if you wake up early then go and start your day sleeping in can make your body and mind sluggish limit your consumption of caffeine it is very tempting to down a cup of coffee whenever you need speed and focus on a task be careful though because this one can backfire control your caffeine consumption so it boosts your response times without making you fidgety and scatter brained stick to just 1 cup prior to working on a task requiring quick responses so you don t get jittery and lose focused 17 x research source this also goes for energy drinks as well don t ditch the coffee only to replace it with a canned energy drink monitor your medications some medications can slow down your response time and reflexes or you may even experience dizziness or blurred vision if you need a high reaction speed make sure to talk to your pharmacist or your doctor about how your medications might impact your abilities 18 x research source this is an especially important step to follow if you are about to drive a motor vehicle even in good conditions you ll want to have sharp reflexes don t get discouraged if you can t change your medications at all by working on your mental and physical agility you can still improve your reflexes,Sports-and-Fitness

how to land a jump from a high place,jumping is an essential part of sports and fitness knowing how to properly land a jump can mean the difference between failure and success in a sporting competition knowing how to jump from a higher place doesn t just relate to games however there can be life or death scenarios that demand you execute a proper leap knowing the ins and outs of proper jumping as well as keeping your body in good shape will help maximize your success with it in the future,consider the safety of the height while height is just one of the factors that dictates the safety of a fall along with falling surface and jump form it is something you should take into consideration while you plan your jump falling from a height of 10 feet or more can result in serious life long injury or even death 1 x research source if you participate in a sport that requires jumping from great heights then work up to this gradually and take all of the necessary safety precautions you should also be aware that repeatedly landing jumps from a great height can be as damaging to your spine as getting hit in the head is to your brain there have been a few recorded cases of people falling thousands of feet and surviving don t use this as an example to go by however these are considered miraculous exceptions for a good reason find a soft surface to jump down to 2 x research source whether you re jumping down for fun or in an emergency the surface you re landing on will have a huge effect on the landing itself softer surfaces are always preferable to hard ones as they ll help absorb some of the shock of the land grass sand and mud are good places to fall to concrete on the other hand is about as unforgiving as it gets surfaces with a lot of degree can pose an extra threat landing onto an otherwise soft area with pine needles would result in a different but similarly intense sort of pain wear shoes with shock absorption if you have time to prepare for your jump you should make sure to wear something on your feet that will help to cushion the force if you re aiming for a proper landing on your feet you run the risk of hurting them without something to ease the shock most sports sneakers include this technology in some form shoes with a strong grip help if there s any risk of slipping during your fall try to relax 3 x research source while it may seem counter intuitive if you re getting ready for a big jump it is important to relax a much as you can if you get needlessly frustrated your joints will tense up this increases the risk of potential injury if you ve got the time to spare try looking at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself everything will be okay lower yourself as much as possible 4 x research source there may be unfortunate occasions where you need to land a high jump in an emergency and aren t doing it for athletic sport if this is the case you ll want to be as practical as possible look around you and try to see if there are any opportunities to get yourself lower to the ground holding yourself off a ledge can get you 6 feet closer to the ground this difference in altitude can mean a lot with regards to potential injury 5 x research source get a friend to keep watch 6 x research source a friend is good to have around because he can watch your jump and tell you how it looks it goes without saying that having a friend watching over you is more helpful if he s already got some fitness knowledge perhaps more importantly the presence of someone nearby will ensure the quickest call for medical attention if you need it for whatever reason warm up before your jump 7 x research source squats and stretches should be done in the minutes before your jump even if it s not enough time to train the act of going through a bit of a moderate workout will loosen up your joints and get your body into the proper momentum for strain pinpoint the landing target as you re about to jump make a point of spotting the place you would like to land having a specific place on the ground below you will increase your stability if you re only aiming for a broad area you re more likely to lose concentration run through a mock jump although you should have already warmed up by this point you can go through a mock jump right before you make the actual leap many athletic jumpers use a mock run through in the seconds before as a way to build up momentum you should do the same as you count down to your leap use these final moments as an opportunity to check everything you re doing with your jump set up jump towards your target in a jump down to a lower place you won t want to jump much higher than you already are get just enough force to earn you the proper stance and momentum keep your elbows close to your body and tuck your chin in close to your neck 8 x research source bend your knees and lunge forward however much you need to all of this will minimize potential injury for the sake of keeping your body straight keep your eyes fixed forward this will keep your body from going imbalanced in mid jump some people may freak out if they see themselves dropping a far enough distance so if you re queasy it s best to keep your eyes off the ground hold your form a proper athletic jump should end in the same stance as it began do your best to keep your body straight even in freefall it s important to keep your stance straight and stable letting your limbs go wild will increase the risk of injury keep your feet and knees together while you jump this will maximize the chances of you landing on both feet 9 x research source although you ll want to keep your body from moving around excessively you should allow room for flexibility as your body meets the landing 10 x research source spare room for flexibility giving your body the freedom to adjust as you meet the ground is essential for preventing injury 11 x research source don t lock your knees at any point and give your muscles the limberness they ll need to counter the force of the land bending the knees will reduce shock just make sure your legs aren t bent more than 90 degrees 12 x research source exercising with squats will help your body adjust to this change when it s needed 13 x research source allow your body to go limp if your body is soft rather than tensed you ll be able to react naturally to a landing this is a natural way of minimizing potential damage in a fall 14 x trustworthy source university of california division of agriculture and natural resources extension program of the university of california system devoted to educating and improving local communities go to source with this said it s a good idea to try to make yourself as relaxed as possible before you set into your jump try to strike a balance between going limp and holding your proper form land on both feet 15 x research source in any type of jump landing on one foot effectively doubles the amount of pressure on that foot do your best to keep your legs and feet together throughout the jump this will maximize the chances of your feet hitting the ground at the same time landing on both feet is more important if your jump is high enough an imbalanced fall can result in severe injury don t try to break your fall with your hands hands can alleviate some of the shock on your feet but they can generally withstand only a fraction of the pressure that feet can 16 x trustworthy source university of california division of agriculture and natural resources extension program of the university of california system devoted to educating and improving local communities go to source when you land try to land on the balls of your feet shoulder width apart perfect a landing roll it s not just a thing for action movies a landing roll is arguably the best way of absorbing shock from a fall if you re landing from a height you should aim for a diagonal roll pushing yourself into a roll with one foot will avoid placing stress on your spine 17 x research source as you fall aim a shoulder to the ground in the direction you want to roll in as you re rolling take a foot and hit the ground with it to give you the extra force you need to complete the roll rolls are difficult to master and should be left to trained athletes it should be said as a high difficulty alternative to landing on both feet try rolling on both sides it s a good habit for athletic versatility and you may find you prefer one side over the other 18 x research source for practice regular gymnastics rolls without a jump will get you used to the experience of rolling they re relatively easy to do provided you have a degree of fitness and flexibility if you want to practice with diagonal rolls a playground with a soft ground is a good place to start 19 x research source rolls lead well into continued movement this is why they re so highly recommended in sports like parkour do squats 20 x research source squats are a great go to exercise they re relatively cheap and easy to do anywhere but they target a lot of muscles that aren t typically worked out to squat bend your knees as low as you can while you keep your back perfectly straight hold your place for 30 seconds then release and try again squats are remarkably challenging at first if you re unused to them however your body will train up fast work plyometrics into your exercise routine plyometrics refer to a series of exercises intended to balance out the use of muscles in your legs because people are usually sitting down in their jobs the sedentary behaviour trains the legs to depend on knees instead of glutes plyometrics aims to reverse this 21 x research source make a sequence of tiny jumps only a couple inches off the ground try to make your landings as quiet and soft as possible 22 x research source shift your body s weight around on your heels keeping your knees behind your toes throughout the movement get enough sleep 23 x research source most people aim to get by with 5 or 6 hours per night this is short of the recommended 7 9 hour routine athletes should arguably be sleeping 9 10 hours in order to accommodate for all of the wear and tear the body goes through from regular practice if you re not giving yourself enough sleep you re putting a major curb on your jump potential stay hydrated 24 x research source water is a necessary thing for the body to function and you tend to need more of it when you re exercising in the case of jumping water is essential to keep the joints fluid and limber keep a refillable bottle of water whenever you re planning to train or jump drink it whenever you get a break don t drink so much water that you end up feeling bloated the feeling doesn t last forever but it is uncomfortable and limits your training for a while take your training slowly 25 x research source if you re lucky enough to be jumping for fun rather than necessity you should take advantage of the fact that you can learn at your own pace start with small heights and gradually work your way forward the process may not be as glamorous as with taking the biggest jumps from the start but it is more effective in terms of raw learning keep practicing 26 x research source jumping can be a lot of fun even if you consider yourself properly trained at a certain point there s a lot of value in continuing to practice because

the flight of stairs to do one leg jumps start in the same position however focus on pushing off with one leg only and landing on that one leg continue as far as you can make sure the stairs are deep and not shallow meaning your entire foot should fit on the step you want your whole foot to be able to land flat on the stairs and not hang off the edge make your own stair interval training many of the stair exercises especially cardio exercises you might not be able to do for 30 or 45 minutes all at one time however if you combine a few different cardio exercises you can make a full workout

the floor at ground level 7 x research source try climbing side steps similar to lunges doing side steps up the staircase can help strengthen your legs but more specifically the inner and outer muscles of your thighs 8 x research source start this exercise by standing next to the stairs with your right shoulder facing the stairs step up 1 or 2 steps with your right leg and bring your left leg up to the step below it repeat until you get to the top and then do it again this time leading with your left leg perform stair calf raises this exercise can really make your calves pop it works the gastrocnemius which is likely what you think of when you imagine a calf muscle 9 x research source start by standing on the edge of the stair only about the first fourth of each foot should be on the stair your heels should be hanging off the edge rise up on your toes as high as you can keep your back legs and feet straight and don t allow yourself to lean forward or backwards slowly lower

injury and perhaps even ward off arthritis and osteoporosis 2 x research source becoming more flexible involves daily routines and exercises designed to stretch the muscles and joints,adopt a new attitude toward stretching in the past athletes and fitness buffs were advised to stretch in a way that can actually hinder flexibility this technique known as static stretching involved standing still and forcing muscles or joints into a stretch might feel good in the moment and is great for targeting particular muscles but does not create lasting results in flexibility 3 x research source static stretching forces the body into a tense mode like when you tense up during a car crash which can result in muscle damage instead of static stretching which is about exertion into a stretch you should think of stretching as a relaxing technique 4 x research source remember that old truism that says people who are relaxed during the moment of impact in a car crash tend to be injured less than those who brace themselves first the same is true of stretching put your body into a stretch position and then ease into the stretch you should stay focused and calm without putting any exertion into your muscles or joints 5 x research source stretch after warming up for exercise most experts agree that stretching cold muscles can cause muscle injury or pain 6 x research source instead consider stretching itself part of your exercise routine begin with light aerobic exercise such as brisk walking next when your heart rate begins to increase and your muscles are warmed stretch all major muscle groups engage in your exercise such as running cool down with light exercise such as brisk walking 7 x research source stretch every day or at least six times a week sit ups crunches and push ups are not necessary to become flexible but an exercise program must be balanced in working the opposing muscles of a joint do each stretch for at least 20 seconds and as frequently during the day or week as you prefer try to stretch even on those days when you are not engaging in other fitness activities but don t stress if you can t find the time one study found that stretching six times a week

how to win at kick ups,kick ups which is also known as keepie uppies is the practice of juggling a soccer ball with the feet thighs and head it s a great way to practice ball control and is a workout too winning in competitive kick ups with friends or teammates requires consistent practice and using techniques like watching the ball getting into a cycle and knowing where the ball is going to go you can get good at the basics first solidify your skills and style and then focus yourself for the win,bounce the ball on your thigh although soccer primarily uses the feet beginners at kick ups should master using the thighs first because it s a bit easier than foot juggling the ball should hit the flat surface of the thigh not anywhere on the knee drop the ball to the thigh bounce it once and catch it do this for enough reps to get the motion down before going for multiple bounces use the bridge of your foot on the laces when the thighs are mastered incorporate the feet drop the ball and make contact with it where the toes start keep your toes pointed slightly up so that the ball bounces up rather than forward if you straighten your toes out to point forward the ball is more likely to bounce away from you start with one bounce at a time off your foot making sure the ball goes straight up when you get good at keeping the ball straight go for more kicks in a row start using your non dominant foot most people have a dominant foot and it s easier to let that foot do all the work but the players who are best at kick ups will be equally strong with both feet once you get good with your dominant foot begin practicing just as hard with your other foot this will give your dominant foot a break during competitive kicks ups and give you more options to get a pattern going launch the ball up to your head using either your foot or thigh kicking the ball with just the right amount of power up to your head is tricky and takes time to perfect when you kick the ball into the air it should be just out in front of your head so that you have to lean slightly forward to hit it the ball should bounce off the flat part of your head rather than your forehead work to hit the ball straight up off your head rather than forward or backward moving the ball from your foot to your head may be a little easier than from your thigh to your head because you can get more power with your foot practice consistently beating others at kick ups means being consistently better than them which is only achieved by practicing you should practice kick ups techniques every day to build the strength in your legs and to form muscle memory for the motion juggling the ball takes one way to practice is to set a certain time limit for which you must work on the skills and then increase this time a little bit every day try to go for 10 seconds straight or for 10 reps without dropping the ball set a goal like this and then as you reach it set a new slightly higher goal find the motion that works best for you being comfortable with juggling will help you win kick ups more often so if a certain way of moving feels better do it that way some people like to move the foot at the ankle to pop the ball up while others prefer slightly extending the knee to kick at the ball you can even move your bent leg up and down at the hip 1 x research source try using each approach for a few minutes and see which feels the most natural to you then get proficient at that style do drills to get the technique just right you can t start out with the goal of getting 50 bounces on the first try on a hard surface bounce the ball off the ground and kick it up once into your hands drop it again and kick it twice with a bounce in between before catching it then kick it twice with no bounce and catch it this progression will help get the exact motion right before going for too long 2 x research source you want the ball to go straight up after the kick without too much spin so if you do one kick and it doesn t go straight up stay on that step of the drill until you can kick it straight up this gives you a foundation to build on you can build on this basic drill by passing it from one foot to the other going from foot to head back to thigh or do 10 reps on the foot then 10 on the thigh then 10 on the head the goal of drills is to get the technique right on a few reps before trying for the most reps watch the ball it may feel like keeping your eye on the ball makes you seem weak but it is the most effective way to keep the ball going you may think your foot or leg was positioned perfect for a pass up to your head but watching the ball will help you know for sure where the ball goes will tell you whether or not you got the technique right 3 x research source you can practice juggling the ball without looking to push yourself but when you are playing to win watching will give you an added edge on your opponent focus on your balance kick ups requires you to be on one foot for an extended period of time so having exceptional balance is a useful aspect to master if you are wobbling all over the place with each kick you will have less control of where the ball goes work hard to maintain upright posture and only move enough to keep the ball moving 4 x research source a good way to practice is just standing on one foot for as long as you can while staying up straight and not swaying once you can stand still for a long time you ll be able to practice the movement of kicking move the ball through a pattern some people playing kick ups move the ball around at random and are constantly reacting to wherever the ball goes you can win by having greater control than your opponent move the ball in a pattern using each body part if you move the ball in a pattern you ll know exactly where it is going rather than guessing 5 x research source a good pattern might be right foot left foot left thigh right thigh head or you could go up the right side and down the left side by cycling right foot right thigh head left thigh left foot the goal is planning ahead where you are passing the ball to,Sports-and-Fitness
how to put ski bindings on skis,mounting ski bindings is something you can do yourself if you have the proper tools and know how including a drilling jig and a special drill bit if you don t have the right tools or aren t confident in your ability to get the job done it s always best to have your bindings mounted by the professionals at a ski shop skis come with lines pre marked on them that show you where the manufacturer recommends that you mount the bindings for different types of riding in general the further forward you set your bindings the more control you have over the skis at low speeds the further back the more stable they are at higher speeds,use the factory recommended line if you don t have a preferred skiing style skis have a default ski binding centerline marked on the top side just behind the actual center point this is the default spot recommended to mount your bindings based for the best all around performance mount your bindings here if you don t want to optimize your skis for a certain type of riding or if you want to ride on all types of terrain 1 x research source the manufacturer s recommended centerline is in slightly different places on different types of skis for example on all mountain skis the mark is usually 2 3 cm 0 79 1 18 in behind the true center of the skis place your bindings at the true center point for park and pipe riding find the true center of your skis by measuring your skis from the tip to the tail and making a mark at the exact middle point mounting your ski bindings exactly in the middle of your skis helps you to do things that are common in park and pipe riding like skiing switch style and balancing on rails 2 x research source keep in mind that since the true mounting point is a few centimeters forward of the factory recommended centerline the skis will feel shorter and won t be as responsive and stable at high speeds however they will be easier to maneuver at lower speeds which is very helpful for park riding many skis have other lines pre marked on them in addition to the manufacturer s recommended centerline so you might not have to measure your skis to find the true center mark for park and pipe riding there might be a line that says something like freestyle put bindings 1 3 cm 0 39 1 18 in back from the centerline for powder skiing measure 1 3 cm 0 39 1 18 in back from the manufacturer s recommended centerline and make a mark use this as your mounting point if you plan to mostly ski fresh powder or wet and slushy snow 3 x research source mounting your bindings further back shifts your weight back and makes your skis more stable which helps you float on top of fresh powder or deep wet snow for powder riding your skis might have a line marked behind the recommended centerline that says something like freeride you can use this for powder skiing instead of measuring yourself be careful not to confuse the freeride line with the freestyle line as they are at opposite ends of the spectrum measure the length of your ski boots in centimeters use a tape measure to measure the length of your ski boots in centimeters from the tip of the toe to the back of your heels this will allow you to drill the holes for the bindings the exact right distance apart 4 x research source if you have an old pair of boots and are mounting bindings on a new pair of skis try your boots on first to make sure they still fit you and that you don t need new boots as well set a ski binding drilling jig to your boot length and lock it onto a ski slide the jig s screw hole guides closer together or further apart until they match the length of your boot position the jig onto one of your skis over your chosen mounting point guideline 5 x research source a ski binding jig locks securely onto your skis and has holes that you drill through to ensure you drill in the proper places to screw your bindings into the skis you can purchase a jig online for about 250 usd if you don t have the proper tools for mounting your bindings on skis including the jig and ski mounting drill bits it s best not to do it yourself you could accidentally drill the holes in the wrong places or drill all the way through your skis and ruin them you can get your bindings mounted at a ski shop for about 20 30 usd or maybe even for free with a purchase note that you must do this whole process 1 time per ski choose a ski binding mounting drill bit based on the composition of your skis use a 3 5 mm by 9 5 mm bit for wood or composite core skis opt for a 4 1 mm by 9 5 mm bit if your skis have a metal core 6 x research source ski binding mounting drill bits are special drill bits that only let you drill down to the proper depth they prevent you from accidentally drilling all the way through your skis you can buy a ski binding mounting drill bit online for about 20 usd drill the binding screw holes using ski binding mounting drill bits insert your chosen ski binding mounting drill bit into a power drill and tighten the chuck to secure it drill straight down through each hole in the jig into the ski 7 x research source the jig will guide your drill bit and the bit itself will assure you drill down to the right depth this is why it s essential to use the proper tools for installing your ski bindings put a dab of wood glue into each screw hole blow or knock out any wood chips from the holes in your skis squeeze a small dab of wood glue into each hole to help secure the bindings screws in the holes 8 x research source the glue will also prevent water from getting into the cores of your skis screw the bindings onto the skis using the screws they come with line up the screw holes in the bindings with the holes you drilled in your skis fit a screwdriver bit into your power drill and fix the bindings to the skis using the screws that are provided with them 9 x research source you can also use a hand held screwdriver to screw the bindings onto your skis,Sports-and-Fitness

knees up towards your face,lie with your back flat on the ground and your legs raised for the sake of comfort lie on a carpeted section of floor or on a yoga mat bend your legs and draw up your knees until they re directly over your pelvis bend your knees at a 90 degree angle so that your feet are sticking straight out 1 x research source this style of elbow to knee crunches are great to use if you re a beginner to fitness and exercising they ll build up your abdominal muscles but aren t particularly challenging to learn hold your hands behind your head and look toward your stomach to get your torso into position for elbow to knee crunches stretch your arms up behind you then bend your elbows and hold both hands behind your head bend your neck so that you are looking down your body towards your belly button 2 x research source try interlocking your fingers behind your head to support your head and keep your hands in place contract your abs and bring your knees up to your elbows keep your chin down and tense your abdominal muscles to do a crunch keep your elbows in place and lift your knees upward until your elbows and knees touch you should feel a slight burn in your lower abs as you touch your elbows and knees together 3 x research source make sure that you re engaging your stomach muscles and not just pulling on your head with your hands you can damage your neck if you pull your head up rather than using your abdominal muscles lower your body back to its starting position after you ve completed 1 crunch slowly relax your abdominal muscles and lower your head back down to the ground also lower your knees until they re again directly above your pelvis 4 x research source relaxing your body slowly will keep your abdominal muscles engaged for longer than they would be if you quickly relaxed your muscles do 9 more elbow to knee crunches to complete 1 set after laying back flat on the ground again clench your abdominals and bring your knees up to your elbows complete 9 more crunches in a row to do a set of 10 if you re just starting out and don t have very strong abdominal muscles 1 full set might be as much as you can do as you gain muscle try completing 2 3 or even 4 sets 5 x research source take a 60 second break between each set of crunches to allow blood and oxygen to return to your abs lie on your back and cross 1 ankle over the other interlace the fingers of your hands and place them behind your head lie back on a soft flat surface like a yoga mat or carpeted section of flooring extend both legs in front of you and cross your right ankle over your left 6 x research source wear flexible clothing while doing knee pull crunches for example yoga pants or sweat pants would work well tense your stomach muscles and bring both legs up to your chest engage your abs and bring your head up so you re looking down at your stomach separate your legs don t keep your knees together and bring both knees up until they re almost touching your chest hold the pose for 3 5 seconds and then relax back to your starting pose this is a great workout for your lower core 7 x research source unlike elbow to knee crunches your elbows and knees do not touch each other during knee pull crunches perform 2 3 sets of 10 knee pull crunches each begin each crunch from your starting position flat on your back with ankles crossed tense your abs keep your legs apart and draw your knees up to your chest as your perform the crunches you should feel the burn in your lower abs and core muscles give yourself at least 1 2 minutes between each set of crunches so your muscles can relax 8 x research source if you re new to fitness and exercise you may find that you can only manage to do 1 full set at first lie flat on your back with your hands behind your head do this on a surface that won t hurt your back like a yoga mat or a bed interlace your fingers and use both hands to support your head this exercise is a variation on the standard knee crunch and works your obliques more than other varieties of knee crunches do 9 x research source your obliques are part of your abdominal muscles they re located on the outer sides of your torso and run from your waist to just under your armpits raise your legs so your calves are parallel to the floor lift up your knees so that your legs are bent at a 90 degree angle at your hips extend your lower legs out in front of you so that your calves are parallel to the ground and your feet are in midair 10 x research source this is the starting position from which you ll begin doing crunches you ll also return to this position after every crunch twist your body by bringing 1 knee to the opposite elbow bend your left knee so that your calf and thigh touch and fully extend your right leg flex your abdominal muscles and bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow keep your shoulders low to the ground as you re bringing your knee to your elbow so that all of the work is being done by your abs and core muscles hold the crunch for 2 3 seconds 11 x research source return to your starting pose after touching the knee to the elbow repeat the crunch by bringing your other knee to its

how to be good at sports,if sports are something that interests you it stands to reason you would want to be good at them succeeding at a sport takes skill and skill takes patience and determination however there are other things you need to think about if you want to be a good sports player skill alone may take you far but you ll never go all the way unless you have the right attitude and team spirit to back it up,set ambitious but realistic goals for yourself this does not mean being unrealistic or saying you re going to go professional within a year instead you should take a look at what you are and figure out where you think you would like to be give yourself a suitable amount of time to achieve that goal and break it down into smaller parts if the goal is especially big 1 x research source for example if you do want to go professional take a look at what the requirements are and work your way up to each one you may have to go semi pro first rather than focusing on the big picture focus on the smaller one instead for example you could focus on your technique be a good sport being good at sports means more than physical strength and speed in order to be truly great you need to apply that positive attitude to the way you treat other players even if they re on the other team if you lose a match accept the loss and show respect to the other player for their victory 2 x research source if you set an example of good sportsmanship you ll receive the same respect in turn when you win treat loss as a learning experience figure out what you did wrong then try to improve it for the next game be patient no matter what you do skills are often slow to build if you re not patient you will try to leap into more advanced techniques long before you re ready your motivation will sap away when you don t see improvement immediately keep the long term goal in mind and hang tight in the meantime while you make it a reality remember there is always going to be someone who can do it better than you at least at first impatient athletes tend to make poor ones accept criticism when you play sports you will inevitably receive criticism whether from a coach other players or spectators you need to take most of it with a grain of salt are they angry because you missed a pass or do they sincerely want to help you improve learn to distinguish the constructive criticism from the hurtful remarks in a lot of cases you can use criticism as motivation to get better in whatever area they bring up don t let yourself get defensive 3 x research source your thinking becomes more limited if you allow yourself to become emotional against criticism keep your ego under control even if you think you are the best be open to constructive criticism nurture friendships with other players one of the biggest reasons people join sports teams in the first place is to make friends with new people 4 x research source if you join a team you re bound to run into a lot of people chances are you ll develop friendships with at least some of them making these friendships a priority is a good move if you want to become great at sports you can practice together on your own time the morale boost of playing with friends helps as well team sports like soccer can have some skills practiced in solitude but for others like goalkeeping and passing another person is needed it s helpful to have this other person as a friend it ll make the practice process more enjoyable in the long term let yourself have fun it s possible to get so obsessed with being good at something that you lose track of why you want to be good in the first place not taking the time to enjoy the sport you play results in a fast burnout whether you re practicing or playing a competition try to remember the other reasons why you play sports 5 x research source for example this may include the natural satisfaction you get from exercise or simply the quality time spent with friends join a sports team if you want to become a sports superstar joining a team is a good way to start even if your skills are currently low joining an amateur league will sharpen up your skills sports teams are everywhere and most of them are free to join if you go to school you should go for team tryouts when they re happening recreation centres are often host to sports teams as well 6 x research source if you re not in school you can find or start a sports club online 7 x research source get a great coach great coaches come in all shapes and sizes 8 x research source certain coaching personalities will suit you better than others the best scenario is having a coach who genuinely wants to see you succeed in the early stages enthusiasm is often more helpful than scientific know how across the board communication skills are the most important trait a coach can have 9 x research source there are different levels of sports coach most after school coaches are volunteers with a working knowledge of the sport and enthusiasm for the game you can hire a sports coach with full training and education although it will set you back a lot of money 10 x research source set your sights wide if you want to be truly great at sports it s not enough to focus on a couple of sports alone it is important to set your sights wide with your exercises don t specialize in skills unless you re already a great athlete find ways to train every part of your body whether this means playing multiple sports or doing an all encompassing exercise routine training your entire body will boost your sports performance there s a lot of evidence to suggest that athletes are better if they play more than one sport 11 x research source tend to basics first it s a common misgiving for young athletes to want to jump into the advanced stuff quickly this isn t an effective way to spend training time you need a solid bedrock foundation before you move on to bigger things 12 x research source if you re new to a sport take as much time as you need to get the basic movements down properly it will make advanced skills a lot easier to grasp in the long run some argue that fundamental movement skills such as jumping and kicking should be mastered properly before moving on to applied sports skills 13 x research source allow room for flexibility in an actual competition things aren t usually going to play exactly by the books while you re practicing you ll usually be playing under optimal circumstances in order to make sure you ll be up for the unforeseen challenges you need to predict the conditions of the competition 14 x research source ask yourself if you are learning a skill or if you re learning to actually use that skill in the competitions you ll be in remember this motto train the way you want to play 15 x research source there s no way to perfectly replicate a competition in practice but playing with other people can get you used to the scenarios you ll need to beware of add new levels of challenge as you build a skill it is common for bodies to adapt to a level of strain progress will slow down if you don t keep upping the stakes as you go along bodybuilders and strength oriented athletes do this by increasing their reps or the weights they work with as a competition athlete the best thing you can do to keep progress going is to practice the skills while under fatigue 16 x research source studies have shown that skill execution goes out the window when you get tired so it s a good idea to build endurance in your sport building up your speed is important too speed usually comes with practice but you shouldn t try to rush into speed until you have the basics down pat 17 x research source practice until your skills become second nature if you re wondering at what point a skill becomes mastered it is when you re able to do it automatically and without thinking this is called the autonomous phase and it s where you want to be at if you want to play sports competitively 18 x research source given enough time and repetition a skill will eventually fall under this category when you re in the fray of a game you won t have time to think everything through so practice until it s all automatic so you ll know you re ready when you re playing a sport like football in a competition you re going to potentially need to throw a ball while getting chased by several competitors you can t replicate this stress in private practice so you have to make sure your toss is perfected beforehand keep practicing practice is never something that should stop even if you become great at sports you can always become better if you stop practicing chances are that someone more determined will beat you apply for a gym membership the best athletes know that training doesn t stop at sports skills you want your body to be as sharp as it can be for whatever sport you re playing on the downtime away from sports keep your body in general shape by going to the gym although it may seem daunting or expensive it is absolutely worth the investment if you want to be good at sports there are lots of benefits to going to a gym as you ll know from playing in sports teams exercising with others is very motivating do some research into a prospective gym before you pay for a membership go for a tour and ask for details make sure the gym fits the circumstances of your life before you make your first payment 19 x research source get enough sleep this one should come as obvious but you might be surprised how often proper sleep is glazed over this is especially true during times of intense practice or training where things get so busy it becomes hard to cram everything into a regular day nonetheless your body needs its full rest 20 x research source if you re a teen you should sleep 8 10 hours each night if you re an adult get 7 9 hours of sleep each night 21 x research source eat a healthy well balanced diet everyone should make a point of eating a diet that benefits their body this is especially true if you want to be great at sports eating junk food will work against whatever efforts you make in the gym base your diet on vegetables leafy greens legumes lean proteins and whole grains 22 x research source cut back on empty calories like soda and replace them with things that improve your health if you re lactose intolerant try going without dairy it may sound hard but you ll see benefits within a month drink lots of water water cannot be underestimated as part of a healthy diet staying hydrated will help you feel mentally and physically your best water regulates everything and you should expect to lose some of your natural hydration via sweat while you exercise 23 x research source the common 8 glasses a day guideline isn t mandatory but you should try to keep water next to you whenever you can it s especially important to stock up on water while you re exercising keep a refillable bottle of water around with you refill it when it goes empty you ll find your water consumption goes up a lot if you simply keep it near you stay clear of intoxicants drugs and alcohol aren t recommended if you want to be great at sports alcohol is a diuretic which means it drains your body of hydration 24 x research source your body will expend resources trying to get rid of the alcohol and it can have a negative impact on your sports performance for days after the fact in the long run the amount of calories you digest from alcohol like cider and beer can have a negative impact on your gut 25 x research source get lots of rest the night before game day while it is recommended you try to stick to a regular sleeping schedule it s especially important to do so the night before a big game the competition will be stiff enough so it s not worth it losing your edge just because you weren t willing to sleep at least 8 hours 26 x research source if you are having troubles getting to sleep try some deep breathing exercises or meditating load up on carbohydrates prior to a game while it wouldn t be regularly recommended in a diet athletes should load up on their carbohydrate intake 27 x research source carbs essentially give your body energy and you ll need lots of energy if you re playing a sports competition stay away from sugar for a few hours before a big competition sugar and starches dehydrate your body that is something you want to avoid in the midst of competing 28 x research source keep yourself up to pace with snacks 29 x research source longer matches will be a test of endurance and something as simple as an energy bar or banana can make a big difference warm up warm ups are important for any physically strenuous activity they can be fairly light but a proper warm up will help prevent early exhaustion and injury aim to warm up around half an hour before the start of the game 30 x research source stretch out your arms and legs run in place work up a bit of a sweat this will get your body in the right mode for the competition warm ups also help fight off anxiety pre game anxiety can be an issue for some players so you should keep that in mind if it s something you suffer from know your competition having a good idea what to expect with the opposing side is important regardless whether you re going one on one or playing as a team if you want to know which techniques you should be using in the midst of certain competitors it s a good idea to study their methods in the days and weeks before a big game if there is any footage of those players during a game give it a shot the science of analytics turns the respective skills of your teammates and competitors into a sharp formula 31 x research source matching each player to their best strengths is integral to a team s success professional sports analysts make it their specific business to analyze the sporting behaviour of athletes stay focused on the game you won t get anywhere if you re worried about something else happening in your life life is always complicated and there may be things in your personal life that are bothering you however at least for the course of the game you can t let any of that stuff get to you it may be easier said than done but if winning the game means enough to you it should be a straightforward matter to keep your eyes on the prize 32 x research source push yourself further than others are willing to go a lot of the best athletes may have had a natural aptitude for it but the reason they ultimately succeed is because they want victory more than any of the competition that s a tricky thing to develop inside yourself but if the desire is intense enough you will do just about anything to make your dreams a reality this broadly applies to the mindset of training but it s incredibly important during a competition how much you want to win will have an effect on how far you end up pushing yourself sometimes the distance between winning and losing is very small a world of difference is made from that added bit of effort remember passion is the key to most kinds of success and the same applies to sports,Sports-and-Fitness

how to bet on sports,betting on sports is done for the thrill of the game and to make money while betting on sports can seem almost impossible especially in today s competitive world it is actually fairly simple first you will need to understand the basics of what types of bets are placed second you will need to find a local or online sportsbook to bet at finally if traditional gambling doesn t suit you you can always set up your own fantasy sport s league once you learn the fundamentals you will be on your way to gambling on sports in no time,bet on point spreads point spreads help to balance out the odds of each team winning when people bet on point spreads they usually talk about 3 5 7 5 4 etc this is how many points are added or subtracted from a team s final score take for example the chicago bears 5 and the green bay packers 5 are playing each other this sunday the bears are less likely to win so 5 points are added to their final score 1 x research source in this example the packers will have to beat the bears by at least 6 points for people who bet on them to win if the packers beat the bears by 5 points or less people who bet on the packers to cover the spread will lose money the basic premise is that you need your betting team to either cover the spread or underperform in the same example if you think the packers will win but won t cover the spread put money down on them to do so if the packers win by less than 5 points you will win money if teams wind up meeting the spread not under or over than you neither win or lose money in the same example if the packers beat the bears by exactly 5 points no one wins or loses when point spreads are 7 5 4 5 8 5 1 5 etc they are much more dangerous bets this is because teams don t score half points so you will either win or lose place a bet on the money spread this is a very simple method you are betting on who will win the game outright if you think the chicago cubs will beat the pittsburgh pirates you will bet on them and vice versa the key here is to look at the point spread of the game if the chicago cubs are given a large point spread 5 then they are seen as more likely to win if the spreads are pretty even 0 5 0 5 then the game is largely seen as a 50 50 matchup 2 x research source look at the point spread first before you move onto the money spread if the point spread seems way too high 8 5 it is best to place your money down on the point spread if the point spreads are fairly even 1 1 then move on to the money spread you will be much more likely to win covering a tight money spread if there is inclement weather that also is a heavy factor in money spreads snow rain sleet fog etc can rapidly even the playing field between the two teams and therefore even up the point spread the worse the weather the more random the outcome and therefore the more money you should put down on the money spread put your money down on the totals totals is commonly referred to as the over under this is where the betting organization will give you a number 9 4 10 175 etc the number they give you represents the total number of points scored by both teams combined you have to place a bet as to whether or not the teams combined will score below or above that number 3 x research source take for example the los angeles lakers playing against the oklahoma city thunder the total over under will be 215 you have to bet whether the lakers and thunder will score combined over or under 215 points factor in different circumstances if superstars are hurt on both teams and the over under seems pretty high you might place your bets on under if superstars are playing lights out of late and the over under seems too low you might place your bets on over take decimal odds into account beside every point spread money spread and total over under is a number in decimal form decimal odds are always written as positive numbers never negative for example next to the new england patriots point spread 8 5 is a decimal figure of 2 798 then imagine that you bet 0 1 bitcoins btc on the the patriots point spread that week on an online website multiply the bitcoins you bet by the decimal figure and that is how many bitcoins you will win if you betted correctly so for this example 0 1 x 2 798 is 0 2798 this would most likely be rounded up to 0 28 bitcoins on most websites you will earn 0 28 bitcoins if you bet correctly it is important to remember that decimal odds include your initial stake so for this example you will not get 0 28 plus your initial stake the stake is already included in the 0 28 bitcoin winnings bitcoins are a form of specialized online currency use american odds next to every decimal odds number is either a positive or negative number in parentheses if the number is positive this is how much much money you will make on a standard 100 bitcoin stake win for example american odds are 170 for the money spread on the miami marlins this week this means that for every 100 bitcoin stake you will receive 170 bitcoins back if you put up 0 1 bitcoins as your stake you will get 0 17 bitcoins back the great thing about american odds is that you get your initial stake back so if you bet 1 bitcoin and receive 2 bitcoins as your winnings you will get 3 bitcoins back in total if the american odds number is negative this is how many bitcoins you have to produce as your initial stake in order to get 100 bitcoins back so if the odds are 105 you will have to produce at least 105 bitcoins as your initial stake in order to get 100 bitcoins back bitcoins are a form of online currency begin your search for an online sportsbook a sportsbook is basically a place where you can go and place bets on sports games online sportsbooks are very convenient but are overrun with spam websites advertisements etc it is important to find a site which is safe like bovada or bet365 generally speaking if you type into google online sportsbooks the first few options have the most hits and are reliable 4 x research source 5 x research source if you notice that the site you are on is overrun with ads begging you for money try a different sportsbook advertisements are quick and easy ways for spammers to try and take your money stay away from sites which don t allow you to browse their site until you give a credit card number upfront it is never safe to give out your personal identification information to a site which you have not scouted out yet learn all you can about the betting site you want to make sure that the sportsbooks have the sports you want to bet on some online sites only specialize in one or two sports check out the terms and conditions of the site don t skim over them as they contain valuable information including what they are liable for and whether they can be sued 6 x research source 7 x research source check to see whether the site requires you to put money up front it is important that you know the exact amount and whether you are ever eligible to get that money back find where the sportsbook has posted the minimum and maximum withdrawal deposit limits you will need to know how much money you can receive every day and how much you can place as a stake use the sites resource section to find frequently asked questions and how to contact them you will want to put their number in your phone in case of emergencies if you join their site decide on a reputable las vegas sportsbook if you do not like gambling online nevada is the only state in the country where sports gambling is legal if you are planning a trip to vegas you will need to find a casino that has a sportsbook these can usually be found in phone books yellow pages or online with full descriptions 8 x research source you will need to decide whether you want a sportsbook with a lot of people or a more quiet one remember vegas is a very popular destination so you will not be able to free yourself from everyone however there are some more expensive sportsbooks which offer more private rooms with 10 15 people in them look on their websites to find out what kind of furnishing they have couches chairs etc what food they serve and what types of drinks they offer these are rather small things in the big picture but when you bet you want to be as comfortable as possible another important thing to look for is how many and how big are there tv s when you go to a sportsbook you will need a ton of tv s to watch at once especially if you are betting on multiple games in multiple different sports choose a local bookie local bookies are numerous throughout the united states and can almost always be found at sports bars if you know of numerous people who use him her as their bookie chances are they are safe and trustworthy you can do any of the traditional bets you can do at sportsbooks bookies gather together pools of money from multiple gamblers and then disperse the money once the games are over 9 x research source 10 x research source because sports gambling is illegal everywhere except nevada you need to scout out your bookie carefully they could be an undercover policeman go to the bar a few times and watch the bookie work ask your friends and family about their experiences working with him make sure your bookie pays you on time sometimes bookies can be passive when it comes to their clients tell your bookie up front that you want your money on time every week make it a point of order to always meet him at the same location and time after every game only bet very small amounts at first with him in order to build trust once you know he will deliver every week you can up the amount that you bet learn about the sport you want to bet on there are such things such as proposition bets which are basically random bets on coin tosses the weather in a game etc however if you plan on doing some serious gambling on games you will need to know your stuff remember especially online there are tons of gamblers who do years of research 11 x research source familiarize yourself with one sport at a time you do not want to bet on every sport you love really dive into the stats on the sports organization s website or on sportsbook site keep track of the outside factors which come into play with sports such as weather injuries revenge etc start betting small amounts as you win a few times and build up your confidence you can gradually increase the amounts you bet this is important for managing your bankroll wisely you want to make profits overtime as winning a huge amount once is fairly rare as long as you are consistently winning more than you are losing and only placing small bets at a time you will have much better odds overall at making a profit 12 x research source 13 x research source 14 x research source never gamble away money you need to pay bills keeping the electricity and water running are much more important than sports gambling use money you have left over from normal expenses this means money leftover after you have payed bills put away money into your savings account and bought groceries for the week plan ahead of time save a little bit of money each week until you have a nest egg to gamble with for example if you plan on betting on the next football season save a year in advance this way if you lose the first few times you will still have money to fall back on recruit friends and family members fantasy sports is traditionally not seen as gambling and therefore hasn t been regulated as such however you are giving an initial stake and using your skills to win a return on your investment to recruit members first ask your family if they wish to join 15 x research source post sheets on bulletin boards at your job with black spaces left for names and phone numbers these sheets should identify who is running the league your name where the league will be located and how much money you need for an initial stake you can also post online at your social sites like facebook and twitter asking for members to join your league if you would rather join a league there are plenty of reputable sites online such as espn and other official sports sites which offer fantasy leagues you might also look for friends or family who have started their own agree on some terms you will first need to decide what the official entry fee will be the fees will go into one pot and will be given to the winner at the end of the football year some teams cough up 100 dollars a piece while others find it fun to have a free league bragging rights after you agree to the fee each player has to come up with an official team name 16 x research source be creative with the team names as long as the other members approve it is fine if you are playing with random players you might want a more politically correct name which won t offend the commissioner of the league you will approve the names then as a group come up with a league name if you wish set up some official rules the first thing you need to decide as a group is how many fantasy points a player gets for each action they take this includes touchdowns yardage incompletions dropped catches made field goals etc if you are doing a football fantasy league you will need to set up a playoff system determine how many teams can make the playoffs and which nfl weeks the playoff games will be played 17 x research source another important rule is setting up a waiver wire the waiver wire is basically how many free agents a team can add the selection order etc create a system where you can trade players if the trade is clearly one sided you should have a process of vetoing the trade deal as well track and score your statistics you can do this one of two ways first you can calculate statistics the old fashioned way using a pencil paper and a calculator look at the local sports page use your fantasy point charts you created earlier and add your points up this takes very long however to do by hand so it is recommended that you use a hosting site 18 x research source hosting sites basically calculate the fantasy score of each player every week instead of having to add the points yourself they already have the job done for you this way you can focus on the fun of fantasy sports and not the downsides espn nba mlb nfl yahoo etc all have fantasy scores written on their websites select a date for your annual player draft the weekend before your sport begins is usually the best time to host a player draft this is where you will all get together write down all the players in your sport on one big board and slowly draft them over the course of a few hours you will want to bring a computer or smartphone with you as you will need to use a hosting site to choose the best available players 19 x research source 20 x research source as a host of draft night make your friends feel at home typically the living room is used as the best place to draft players this is a great time to make a feast cook hotdogs hamburgers chili have potato chips and pretzels have three or four types of soda ready the atmosphere should feel like you are at a tailgate party once your players are drafted you are ready to begin fantasy sports wait each week to see how your team does start and sit players based on their performances trade players for that final playoff push,Sports-and-Fitness

how to build a ninja warrior course,if you want to compete against ninja warriors you have to train like them the best way to do this is to build your own ninja warrior course at home with a few building supplies and a little work you can be training for the real thing in no time,find a good spot to build your course pick the spot where you want to build your course before you draw up your plans since you might have to account for narrow spaces low hanging tree branches or other environmental factors 1 x research source pick a spot that s free of dangerous obstructions like protruding tree roots or sharp rocks the best place to build is a big open backyard where you ll have plenty of room to run jump and swing take measurements of the space where you want to build so you can plan the exact dimensions of your course decide which ninja warrior obstacles you want to include in your course popular obstacles include the salmon ladder warped wall and quad steps but with the right materials you can replicate many of the challenges you see on the show choose obstacles that will work with the space you have for instance if you have a very narrow backyard you might want to build only a salmon ladder if you can t dig post holes in your yard you might only build the quad steps don t be afraid to get creative if you have a sturdy tree branch in your yard for instance you could hang a series of ropes from the branch to create your own tarzan rope where you must travel a distance by swinging from rope to rope decide on the order of your obstacles if you re including several ninja warrior obstacles decide how you want to go through them the order changes sometimes on the show but the quad steps is usually the first obstacle and the warped wall is usually the last but you can arrange your course however you want try arranging your obstacles in varying intensity for instance if one obstacle requires a lot of upper body strength try following it with one that builds your balance then one focusing on leg strength draw your blueprints draw the obstacle course exactly as you picture it on a large piece of paper using the measurements you took from your yard by having a blueprint you can plan out exactly how your obstacles will fit in the space you have available having a plan in advance can also help you design your obstacles to be as safe as possible when you re drawing a blueprint you want to draw to scale for instance you might decide that 1 inch 2 5 cm on your blueprint is equal to 1 foot 0 30 m in real life in that case you would draw a 12 feet 3 7 m post exactly 12 inches 30 cm tall on your blueprint your blueprints should show a top view and a side view to help you picture it as you build 2 x research source if you re using found materials to build your course try to gather them up before you draw your blueprint since they could alter the dimensions of your plans dig 2 post holes 3 5 feet 1 1 m apart and 2 5 feet 0 76 m deep you can adjust the width of the salmon ladder by moving the posts closer together or further apart but on the show the obstacle is 3 5 feet 1 1 m wide 3 x research source use a post hole digger to easily remove dirt for your posts if you don t have one of these use a small hand shovel choose posts that will be are at least 14 5 metres 48 ft long your posts need to be buried at least 2 5 feet 0 76 m deep and the salmon ladder should be about 12 feet 3 7 m high to give you room to climb 4 x research source anchor your posts into the ground pour cement around the base of your posts after you get them buried in the ground make sure to give the cement plenty of time to dry before you move to the next step 5 x research source if you aren t able to cement your posts in place pack dirt around them as tightly as you can then use short pieces of wood to brace the posts the wood should be about 2 feet 0 61 m long place the bracing wood at a 45 degree angle to the post ensure one end of the wood is resting securely on the ground then nail the other end to the post nail rungs into your post spaced 1 foot 0 30 m apart your rungs should be angled at about 35 degrees and should stick out about 4 inches 10 cm the regulation spacing between rungs for a ninja warrior course is 1 foot 0 30 m but you can space them closer together if you don t want as much of a challenge 6 x research source place your first rungs about 4 feet 1 2 m high your rungs can be blocks of wood large nails or any other material that that will support your weight when it s nailed to your posts place a metal bar on the rungs to use your salmon ladder use your upper body strength to move the bar upwards from one set of rings up to the next climbing the ladder with a series of pull up maneuvers and jumps 7 x research source if climbing the salmon ladder is too difficult for you use the salmon ladder to practice pull ups cut a sheet of plywood into 4 2 by 2 ft 0 61 by 0 61 m squares these will be the surface of your quad steps you can make these any size you want but this is an ideal size for training for ninja warrior 8 x research source a standard size sheet of plywood is 4 by 8 ft 1 2 by 2 4 m if you cut your squares into 2 by 2 ft 0 61 by 0 61 m pieces you should only need 1 sheet of plywood cut 16 2 ft 0 61 m sections from lengths of lumber and divide them the standard size board for framing is 2 by 4 inches 5 1 by 10 2 cm but you can use whatever lumber you have on hand as long as it is weather treated and is free of any cracks or soft spots 9 x research source place 8 sections of wood in one pile to be used for framing and the remaining 8 pieces of wood in another pile to be your kickstand boards which are used to hold the quad steps upright as you jump across them 10 x research source cut off 1 corner of each kickstand board at a 45 degree angle you want the kickstand to rest flush against the platform to hold the platform at an angle each cut should start about 1 inch 2 5 cm from the corner of the board carefully use a saw to make these cuts 11 x research source always use caution when using a saw wear safety goggles and keep your hands free from the blades lay 2 pieces of framing wood and the plywood on top of each other the framing pieces should be turned up on their sides and should be touching the outside edge of the plywood 12 x research source attach the plywood to the framing boards with wood screws use 4 2 in 5 1 cm wood screws for each framing board to ensure they are secure for a total of 8 on each platform 13 x research source angle the platform and 2 kickstand boards so they are flush together the kickstands should rest against the framing wood at the corner of the platform when you have the kickstands aligned with the platform the whole assembly should stand upright with the platform propped about 45 degrees off of the ground attach each kickstand board to the framing board with a long wood screw make sure that the kickstands are mounted securely since they will support most of your weight as you jump now enjoy your quad steps 14 x research source if you want to adjust the angle of your quad steps later on use a bolt when you re attaching the kickstands instead of a screw soak 2 4 by 8 ft 1 2 by 2 4 m sheets of plywood in water to soften them if you try to bend dry plywood into a curve for the warped wall it will crack place the plywood in a pool or use spare pieces of wood to prop up the edges of a tarp hold the plywood in the water by placing a cinder block in the middle and leave it there while you build the rest of the frame 15 x research source lay sheets of plywood in 2 l shapes these will eventually be the sides of your warped wall the amount of plywood you will need will depend on the size you want your warped wall to be on the show the warped wall is 14 to 16 feet 4 3 to 4 9 m high but you can adjust the height to your preferences 16 x research source for most walls 3 pieces of plywood will be enough laying the plywood in an l shape will allow you to create a curve along the side of your wall tie one end of a piece of string to a pencil and anchor the other end by tying the free end of the string to a fixed location it will act as a compass creating a circle as you travel around the center point this will help you create the curve for your warped wall the string should be long enough so that the pencil can sweep across the plywood in a gentle curve 17 x research source if you don t have anything to tie the string to have someone stand in one place and hold the string draw a wide curve on both sets of plywood after you draw the curve on the first set of plywood arrange the second set so the string is anchored exactly the same distance away and draw the same curve again 18 x research source cut the plywood along the curve you drew use a saw to carefully cut both sets of plywood once this is done you have the sides for your warped wall stabilize the plywood sides with lumber use 4 by 4 in 10 by 10 cm or another heavy type of lumber to create a frame on your plywood this will reinforce the plywood and will give the final structure more stability make sure you leave enough space between the frame and the edge of the sides for your plywood curve 19 x research source nail in crossbraces along the curve insert wooden boards cut the width of your wall all along the curve to attach the 2 sides of the wall together space these crossbraces out evenly along the length of the curve about 8 10 inches 20 25 cm should be sufficient you can also add extra plywood to what will eventually be the top and bottom of your wall at this time 20 x research source the length of the crossbraces should be cut to fit the width of your warped wall the amount of crossbraces you use will depend on how far apart you space them and how long your warped wall will be for instance if you nail the boards 8 inches 20 cm apart and the length of your curve is 14 feet 4 3 m you will need 21 braces lay the wet plywood on top of the crossbraces and nail it down the crossbraces will help shape the plywood into a curve and it should bend easily since it s been soaking in water finish with a piece of pvc at the top of the curve to act as the ledge you don t want to grab onto the raw wood since you might get splinters cut a length of pvc pipe to match the width of the wall and attach it to the top corner of the wall so you have something to hang on when you reach the top 21 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness

how to increase your lactate threshold,during physical activity your body produces a substance called lactate your lactate threshold is the point during intense exercise when your body begins to produce lactate faster than it can eliminate it when this happens you may feel sore short of breath and exhausted 1 x research source everyone s lactate threshold is different so try to determine yours before you work on increasing it raise your threshold by gradually increasing your training volume doing tempo runs and doing interval training you may also be able to boost your threshold with branched chain amino acid bcaa supplements,get your lactate threshold tested at an exercise lab in a traditional lactate threshold test a technician will draw small amounts of your blood at various points during an incremental exercise test the exercise test is typically carried out on a treadmill or stationary bike with the intensity of the exercise increasing after every 3 minute interval your blood will be taken at the end of each interval 2 x research source the average person will hit their lactate threshold once they reach about 50 60 of their maximal oxygen uptake vo2 max however trained athletes tend to have a higher threshold e g the lactate threshold occurs at around 85 95 vo2 max for endurance athletes lactate threshold testing in a lab can be expensive costing anywhere from 75 200 usd to find a lab in your area search for something like lactate threshold testing near me or lactate threshold lab chicago estimate your lactate threshold with a field test the field test is less accurate than a traditional lactate test but it will give you a general estimate of your lactate threshold set your treadmill at a 1 grade and do about 10 minutes of easy jogging to warm up then run for 30 minutes at the fastest pace you can maintain for that period of time note your heart rate at 10 minutes and again at 30 minutes and divide the sum by 2 to determine your average heart rate at your lactate threshold your average pace during the run should be the approximate pace you can maintain at lactate threshold 3 x research source this test works best on a treadmill that measures your time running distance and heart rate do this test at a time when you are well rested and not tired from recent training or intense exercise use a non invasive led sensor to measure lactate levels you can test your own lactate levels during exercise with an led sensor device that attaches to your calf these devices feed data into a smartphone app that can calculate your lactate threshold pace and heart rate the app also guides you through the test workout 4 x research source production of the most widely available device of this type the bsxinsight has recently been discontinued however similar devices are currently in development the bsxinsight device cost about 300 usd while similar devices such as the moxy muscle oxygen monitor may cost 800 usd or more the moxy does not measure lactate levels but can be used to get a ballpark estimate of your lactate threshold much like the field test 5 x research source set a weekly training goal the best way to start increasing your lactate threshold is to gradually increase your weekly training time work with your personal trainer or coach to set a reasonable target goal and discuss the best way to reach that goal 6 x research source for example if you are currently doing 100 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week you might set a goal of working up to 200 minutes per week if you don t have a trainer or coach ask your primary healthcare provider for advice they may be able to refer you to someone who can help you meet your fitness goals increase your training volume by 10 20 per week work up to your target training volume gradually to achieve the best and safest results increase your exercise time each week in increments of 10 20 whichever works best for you 7 x research source if you re going from 100 to 200 minutes of exercise per week at an increase of 20 per week you should reach your goal in 4 weeks keep the intensity light while you are increasing your exercise volume as you re gradually ramping up your total exercise time keep your level of exertion light and easy don t worry about using an objective measure of intensity instead focus on how intense the exercise feels to you 8 x research source the goal is to keep your level of exertion around 11 12 fairly light on the rating of perceived exertion rpe scale which you can view here https www hsph harvard edu nutritionsource borg scale your level of activity should feel comfortable e g walking at a pace that is not fast enough to significantly increase your breathing and heart rate vary your time per session you don t always have to exercise for the same amount of time during each training session work with your trainer to figure out what works best for you however aim for a minimum time of 10 minutes per session 9 x research source for example you might do a low intensity 45 minute treadmill session one day and 2 20 minute sessions the next determine your maximum steady state mss pace your maximum steady state mss is the maximum running speed you can maintain without your lactate levels spiking if you can t determine your exact mss e g using lactate testing in a lab estimate it by assessing your level of exertion during running you should feel like you are exercising somewhat hard to hard 13 15 on the rating of perceived exertion scale 10 x research source a good general measure of exertion is how heavily you are breathing and how fast your heart is beating when you are exercising somewhat hard your heart rate and breathing should be slightly elevated but you won t feel out of breath at a hard level of exertion you should be breathing fast and feel your heart speeding up or pounding 11 x research source your mss pace is typically a pace that you could maintain for up to an hour 12 x research source if you can find your exact mss pace by doing a test in an exercise lab incorporate tempo runs into your weekly workout routine a tempo run is a run that is performed at your mss pace right at your lactate threshold incorporating tempo running or some other steady state exercise into your regular routine can help gradually increase your lactate threshold devote no more than 10 of your weekly cardiovascular exercise time to tempo running or other steady state exercises 13 x research source for example if you are doing 200 minutes of cardio per week do a 20 minute tempo run each week start with a 20 minute warm up before starting a tempo run do 20 minutes of running at a light easy pace you should feel like you are exerting some effort but not so much that you are breathing heavily or feel your heart pounding 14 x research source run for 20 minutes at your mss pace after you warm up it s time to pick up the pace run fast enough so that you feel you are working yourself hard but not so hard that you don t think you could maintain the pace for a full hour 15 x research source at this pace you may feel your heart beating fast and find it difficult to speak more than a few words at a time cool down with a light run after 20 minutes of hard running slow down to an easy pace again maintain the light run or jog for 10 minutes 16 x research source work out above your lactate threshold interval training is a type of workout that alternates short bouts of high intensity aerobic exercise with short recovery intervals of low intensity exercise each interval should only last a few minutes at a time the high intensity bouts should be done above your lactic threshold in other words you should feel like you are working very hard 17 18 on the scale of perceived exertion at around the highest level of activity you can sustain for longer than a few minutes at a time 17 x research source at this level of exercise you will feel your heart pounding very fast and may be breathing hard enough that it is difficult to speak 18 x research source incorporate interval training into your weekly routine to get the most out of interval training plan to do 1 session every week however to avoid injury and overwork interval training should account for no more than 10 of your weekly cardiovascular activity 19 x research source for example if you are doing 200 minutes of cardio each week do no more than 20 minutes of interval training total per week if you are also doing steady state exercises like tempo runs avoid scheduling this type of exercise close to your weekly interval training give yourself 2 days to recover between these types of training develop a high intensity interval training routine there are many ways to do high intensity interval training hiit work with your trainer or coach to choose a routine that works best for you for example you might try 4 rounds of the following routine with 12 second periods of inactivity between each exercise 20 x research source 35 seconds of drop lunges 35 seconds of burpee crunches 35 seconds of plank jack hops 35 seconds of step to jump squats 35 seconds of pop jacks 35 seconds of triceps back presses talk to your doctor or dietitian about bcaa supplements bcaa branched chain amino acid supplements may help increase your endurance and raise your lactate threshold 21 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source while these supplements are relatively safe when taken at

regular clients you ll be able to remember what they respond well to watch for clients who seem to be struggling if you notice a person or group of people who seem to be falling behind go out of your way to encourage them pay attention to and respond to their reaction if they want to be pushed hard help them along but if they don t like the extra attention let them exercise at their own pace cultivate a positive teaching attitude staying positive will help get your clients through tough workouts be uplifting in the way you talk to your clients with phrases like you re doing great or just keep pressing forward remember to smile at your class to show them that you re happy to be there with them if you seem tired or gloomy your class may perceive this as disdain for them or the workout

pump yourself up you still have a game to play be sensible about how much you exert yourself beforehand avoid overstimulating yourself by refraining from drinking too much caffeine or energy drinks

night before a special occasion do something new as a group to reinforce your bond host a dinner go on a road trip or go to the movies to see an inspiring film together it doesn t necessarily have to

moments either watch your best game where everyone was on point or create a highlight reel of individual plays and triumphs you can do this at any time in the days leading up to the game have a late

instructions to individual teammates out of it stick to general statements like we got this in the bag and i know we can do this emphasize the team not individuals avoid singling out star players and putting too much burden on them which might psych them out instead of psyching them up at the same time boost other teammates confidence by always using the inclusive we think of the big game as just

any distractions that might steal your focus from your performance such as setting a double alarm confirming all travel arrangements and laying out and or packing your uniform warm up gear and equipment to reduce the chances of running late on game day completing any unrelated tasks like homework or paying bills beforehand so you re not tempted to worry about them during the game know when to dial back remember pumping yourself up for the big game doesn t mean going berserk you don t for example want to psych yourself up for a race so much that you burst from the starting line at a pace you can t maintain so pay close attention to your ability to focus on what you actually need to do during the game if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by the stakes involved try 9 x research

how to play water polo,water polo is a played like a combination of soccer and basketball but with the physicality and endurance of wrestling or football it is one of the world s most popular games and was actually the first team sport admitted to the olympics 1 x research source while the finer points of fouls and pool dimensions are somewhat complex the basics of the game are easy to learn and start playing quickly,play in a rectangular pool with two goals on opposite ends the object of water polo is identical to soccer put the ball into the opposing team s goals to score and the team with more goals wins in regulation games a goal is 9 meters 3 ft tall and 3 meters wide but you can use whatever you have around to make a good net no player should be able to touch the bottom of the pool don t have goals and want to play a casual game you can turn over trashcans instead and play without a goalie regulation pools are 25 30 meters 82 98 ft long and 17 20 meters wide they should be about 2 meters 7 ft deep 2 x research source divide into two even teams each with one goalkeeper in regulation games teams each have seven players six attackers and one goalie however depending on your level of competition and the size of the pool the most important thing is to have an even number of players on each team in order to know who is on what team players usually wear matching swim caps goalies typically each wear a separate color from both teams if you have more than 14 people playing it is a good idea to have substitutes water polo is very tiring if you re just playing for fun and have an odd number of players you can make one player always offense they simply play for the team that currently has the ball start the game by racing to the ball in the center of the pool the game starts with a swim off where the two teams swim to get the ball and start the attack in regulation games a machine or referee drops the ball in the center but you can just as easily leave a ball in the center of the pool and say go the team that gets the ball first is on offense first hold pass and shoot the ball with only one hand at a time using both hands at the same time is a foul the only exception to this is for the goalie who can use both hands within a 5 meter area of the goal if the keeper swims forward to join the attack they too must only use one hand at a time this rule is to prevent clutching or holding the ball for insanely long periods making it impossible for the other team to win it back set a 30 second shot clock like in basketball to score by because you can t foul people to get the ball one team could theoretically score one goal then hold onto it for the rest of the game this is why water polo has a 30 second shot clock that starts as soon as a team gets the ball if a team does not score or reset the clock in 30 seconds the defensive team gets the ball for a free throw where it currently sits the shot clock only resets when the defensive team gets clear control of the ball the offense scores there is a major foul wrestle for the ball but not the player to win possession without fouling water polo is an incredibly physical game both above the water and below it but almost all player to player contact is a foul you can however go for the ball knocking it out of a player s hands to regain possession if you hit the ball out or the player uses two hands to protect it the ball is yours you cannot touch or impede players without the ball you cannot hold the ball underwater to avoid getting it taken you cannot grab kick or push a player while ignoring the ball 3 x research source do not go closer than 2 meters 6 6 ft from the goal unless you have the ball the 2 meter line is marked by red lines on the sides of professional pools and offensive players cannot cross this line unless they are carrying the ball you cannot receive a pass if you re already past this mark either you must have the ball as you cross it or you can t cross it at all the goalie of course can be within the 2 meter line without the ball for less serious games remember that 2 meters 6 6 ft is roughly the height of an average adult male stay this far from goal if playing a casual game restart missed shots with a throw from goal or a corner throw depending on who touched it last this is similar to soccer but with one catch a missed shot can deflect off a defender and still be the defense s ball however if a goalkeeper deflects a ball away from goal and over the end line the offense gets a corner throw goal throw if the offense misses or deflects a shot off of a defender not the goalie the defensive teams gets a free throw anywhere behind the 2 meter line corner throw if the goalie deflects the ball out or a defender intentionally throws the ball behind their own goal the offense gets a free pass from the edge of the pool at the 2 meter line 4 x research source score a goal when the entire ball passes completely over the goal line this means that the whole ball passes by both posts it does not need to hit the back of the net in order to score in regulation games this scoring line is marked by an all white goal line restart play after a goal only once both teams are in their own half once a team scores they must return to their half of the pool before the game can start again the goalie who was scored on can then pass from their goal to a teammate restarting the game the shot clock starts once this first pass is made 5 x research source play four separate 8 minute quarters switching sides after the first two this is the regulation length of a game so you can adjust it to your liking if you re just playing for fun in general there are 2 minute breaks between each quarter with 10 minutes for halftime between the second and third quarters younger age groups usually play 5 6 minute quarters the clock stops after a major foul exclusion or a goal and only starts again when the ball is back in play understand the three categories of fouls and their consequences fouls in water polo are a mixture of basketball and hockey rules and they range from minor fouls to brutality fouls that cause a permanent ejection from the game each foul is detailed along with the referee s reaction and signal below ordinary fouls referee blows the whistle once and points in the direction the team is attacking towards restart is a free throw from the location of the foul two whistles indicate that the offense not the defense caused the foul exclusions major fouls referee blows the whistle twice quickly then one long blast they spin their arms to indicate a player must leave and the fouling player must swim to the edge of the pool for 20 seconds and play starts with a free throw penalty fouls referee blows the whistle three times like above then raises 5 fingers above his her head the fouler leaves the field and play starts with a free shot on the 5 meter line for the fouled team 6 x research source restart ordinary fouls with a free throw at the spot of the foul these are also called minor fouls ordinary fouls are not counted or used against players and the clock does not stop after they are called they are by far the most common fouls in water polo and include touching the ball with two hands touching the bottom of the pool holding the ball underwater to prevent stealing impeding or getting in the way of players who don t have the ball to prevent them from moving letting the shot clock expire throwing a ball outside of the pool sit players for 20 seconds with their team playing a man down for exclusion fouls these are also called major fouls and are for more serious and aggressive conduct once called the fouling player must immediately swim to a designated zone in front of their bench usually the halfway line after 20 seconds or a goal is scored whichever is first they can swim back in and resume play exclusions fouls are for pulling holding or sinking players without the ball splashing water in a player s face blocking a shot with two arms kicking or hitting another player violently disrespecting the game or referee swearing leaving the pool and getting back in spitting grant penalty shots for fouls within the offensive 5 meter line or very rough fouls the foul must be within the 5 meter line as well as preventing a probable goal any foul if it takes away a probable goal can be a penalty foul your team gets the ball at the 5 meter line against the goalie and play resumes after the shot very violent fouls called brutality can result in a penalty shot regardless of where in the pool the foul was committed most penalty fouls are called when a defender fouls a shooting player from behind the goalie must be completely within the goal for the shot not in front of it play a player down for four minutes if charged with a brutality these are for excessive or violent fouls like kicking striking or extreme language or unsportsmanlike conduct you must leave for the remainder of the game and your team will play a man down for four minutes if a penalty foul is called for a brutality the team who was fouled gets the ball back at the half line after shooting even if they scored a strike that is determined as deliberate is the most common brutality called 7 x research source leave the game if you re called for three major fouls if you receive three exclusion calls against you you are out for the remainder of the game unless the final foul was considered a brutality your team may substitute another player in your place when you leave your team still has to play with the 20 second exclusion you can substitute after this period is over 8 x research source understand that a ref can call advantage if it is better to keep playing than take a foul again this is similar to soccer if the referee thinks you re better off keeping the ball such as being fouled right after you make a good pass they can say advantage to acknowledge the foul but keep your team s offensive momentum in general overly violent or dangerous fouls are called immediately even if there is an advantage 9 x research source use the eggbeater kick to stay afloat while conserving energy regulation water polo players are not allowed to push off of the wall or sides of the pool you must tread water the entire time this is incredibly exhausting but good players use a rounded more efficient motion to stay afloat bend your knees roughly 90 degrees as if you were sitting keep your legs slightly wider than shoulder width apart rotate your right leg counterclockwise rotate your left leg clockwise time your legs so that they alternate fluidly 10 x research source hold one player up in front of the goal to direct your attack they are called the center forward and sit about 2 meters 7 ft outside of the goal to cause confusion and take close range shots when you get the ball as a center your goal is to quickly turn and fire a shot off centers take the bulk of physical play and must have the best endurance and strength centers are also called hole sets by some coaches place two players at the 2 meter line on either side of the goal as wings you should have a line of three players in front of the goal on offense two wings on the sides and one center forward in the middle a wing s goal is to take long range shots as well as pass back and forth with the center to make space for a shot wings need to have quick accurate and long range shots remember that you cannot use the walls to push off you should be a few meters in from the wall as a wing place your two flats on the 5 meter line between the wings and center flats are great passers and long range shooter they swim at the goal to draw defenders which hopefully opens up space for the center forward to get free they must race back on defense when the ball is turned offer flats tend to be very quick very mobile swimmers keep one player behind everyone near the half line and in the center of the pool this is your point player they are the first ones back on defense and the main passers of the team seeing and setting the entire offense they rarely shoot instead looking for the best most dangerous passes keep your wings point and flats moving to confuse the defense the movement of your perimeter players everyone but the center forward is what opens up shots and breaks down good defenses this can include swapping positions crashing towards the goal or rotating around the pool the center forward can move but they are generally needed to keep the essential space in front of the goal open in case of deflected shots or sudden shooting opportunities flip the offensive formation on defense you simply slide your formation down the pool on defense the point guards the opposing center forward and the center forward guards the point your wings will cover their flats and your flats cover their wings in general you will play either man to man or zone defense man to man defense each player follows their match around the pool no matter where they go zone defense each player stays in their position trading defensive marks as the other team changes positions if the opposing team has a very good center forward this position is sometimes double teamed leaving the offenses point player alone 11 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness

interest in a sport no matter how left field it may appear to you take that as an opportunity to get the child active for example if the inactive child displays an interest in archery trampolining golf rollerskating canoeing dry slope or snow skiing these are all great possibilities for keeping active but may not be considered the standard sport a school offers ask the child whether they like to play classic childhood games like tag or capture the flag these games can get the child out of the house running around even though this isn t a sport this activity is just as good as a child playing sports if the child doesn t want to go outside and play tag there are video game consoles that promote fitness wii xbox kinect etc some of these are very active and can get the child moving

healthier child explore dance if your child is keen to do so dance lessons are a great way to be active for boys and girls jumping around to music at home is great too play them the tunes from your youth and show them how you danced get gran and grandad in on it too family activities can be inclusive of everyone and a learning experience too imagine gran showing the children the waltz and then being shown how to cha cha slide try on a regular basis paying or rewarding in some other way your child to do active household chores mowing the lawn making the beds putting out the washing on the line vacuuming all the floors are all great activities if possible get your child walking to school if your child walks for 30 minutes to school every week day that s fantastic you can let them get a

races egg and spoon races etc set up a mini obstacle course or hurdles have target throwing practice for prizes play ball games throw paper planes or other paper objects over distances and if you have a pool perhaps include supervised swimming races or even synchronized swimming if adults get involved simply make the games harder or challenge them to a tug of war which was once an actual olympic event encourage teams if there are lots of kids or if the adults would like to join in have each team develop its own mascot give them paper stuffed toys markers etc to do this with set out an area with soft mats for anyone who is good at gymnastics or who simply wants to try out some cartwheels and handstands award the children with medals for their wins these could be made from cardboard paper etc attached to ribbon or you could use chocolate coins attached to a ribbon hold an olympics trivia quiz some of the party guests might enjoy testing their wits about all things olympic there are several possible approaches to this run a pub style quiz that only uses the olympics for the subject matter play trivial pursuit but replace the cards with your own olympic themed ones this would be a

how to buy healthy foods for young athletes,young athletes need both fuel to perform in their sports and overall nutrition for their still growing bodies healthy simple food will help them perform at their best and stay in top notch health it may seem that quality food is expensive or time consuming but with a little planning it can be economical and manageable the most important thing is to avoid over processed foodstuffs and eat a variety of foods,determine your young athlete s favorite healthy foods keep in mind that they should consume plenty of protein each day as well as fresh vegetables and fruits and complex carbohydrates settle on some of the favorites as staples i e chicken tuna broccoli green beans and rice when you shop look for the favorite items in bulk or on sale use your freezer to store excess meats fruits and vegetables purchase fruits and vegetables in season and freeze or even dehydrate them for later use even strawberries peaches and blueberries can be delicious in smoothies or with yogurt after they are frozen also purchase items in larger sizes a 25 lb bag of rice or pasta can save money per pound and will be used up more quickly than you might think if you worry about pests store in a plastic bin purchase the most natural highest quality food you can obtain or afford if grass fed meat and butter are not in your budget go for good quality natural options organic fruits and vegetables are best but know which ones are most highly contaminated and therefore most important to buy organic if time is a factor and it is for most busy sports families cook several extra portions and freeze in meal size packets or plan to consume a couple of times over the following few days a vacuum sealer can be helpful for freezing items if your athlete drinks milk consider purchasing whole milk the extra fat is actually valuable for the developing brain for snacks on the go use transportable fruit granola trail mix or meat jerky other snacks might include raw carrots with hummus or healthy dairy dip peanut butter on celery pretzels or hard boiled eggs keep in mind that the more variety in the diet the healthier it will be do not hesitate to try new things and encourage your athlete to explore different foods simple herbs and spices can also add flavor if some things taste bland and many have health benefits as well avoid processed combination foods these usually contain hidden sugars artificial sweeteners or unnecessary or harmful preservative ingredients breakfast cereals are generally over processed so if these are a must look for those with lower sugar content and some portion of whole grains granola is simple to make and can be delicious and more nutritious than store bought cereals cook the items your athlete likes simply you can make enough for several meals at once and freeze or refrigerate extras which saves on cost as well as time for example cook a whole chicken and vary the presentation over several meals to maximize one effort,Sports-and-Fitness
how to help your child enjoy sports,playing organized sports can offer a range of benefits to kids physical health and emotional development however some kids simply don t enjoy sports for any number of reasons and may miss out on these benefits while you can t force your child to love playing sports you can work together to create conditions that may be more enjoyable for him or her your job is to help find a sport or sports that your child will find enjoyable and fulfilling and to help your child keep things in the proper perspective,be realistic about your kid many a parent wants to believe that they have the next tennis champion or basketball star for a child but the odds of a child growing up to achieve athletic fame and fortune is remote at best there is no reason to crush their dreams of eventual sports glory at a young age but you should also realistically assess their physical and emotional gifts as you help guide them into trying certain sports 1 x research source for instance a short stocky kid may not be ideally suited to basketball while a tall lanky kid may not have the easiest time with gymnastics children who are overweight or not at an ideal fitness level may find more enjoyment at least initially in sports with less running demands baseball as opposed to soccer for instance that said plenty of short kids love playing basketball so don t go overboard with your assumptions give your child a say maybe you love hockey and have longed to see your kid out on the ice doing the things you never got the chance to do don t let your vicarious athletic dreams get in the way of actually asking your child what sports he or she wants to play however a child who has a say in the process is more likely to enjoy and stick with a sport 2 x research source it is often around age thirteen or so that some kids get burnout from the sports they ve played leading them to want to quit one or more sports and perhaps try others no matter the age of your kid prepare for ups and downs in regards to interest in particular sports and accept his or her desire to try something new every so often 3 x research source consider coaches and commitment once you ve worked with your child to determine which sport or sports he or she will play you can do some additional homework regarding the best situation for your child look into the skill level and time commitment expected in one league compared to another and even consider the personalities of particular coaches 4 x research source for instance if your kid is just starting to dip his toes into basketball he or she may find the extensive commitment required to be on a travel team that ventures widely each weekend to be too much perhaps a recreational league at your local ymca or another such option may be a better choice likewise if you know your child is unlikely to enjoy playing for a hard nosed coach who criticizes regularly you may want to look into other options of course one of the benefits of sports is learning to deal with adversity so don t go too far in trying to shield them from every possible discomfort watch for signs of stress stress can be a positive thing spurring us to achieve things we didn t know we could do whether in academics athletics or otherwise however excessive stress will impede enjoyment and success in a sport and can easily bleed into other areas beyond the athletic field as well preventing and dealing with negative stress will make it much more likely for your child to enjoy sports 5 x research source if your kid keeps making up excuses why he or she can t go to practice never seems able to crack a smile during a game performs below capabilities when the pressure is on or begins having seemingly unrelated difficulties with academics social interactions etc stress may be overwhelming him or her if you believe stress is a problem talk to your child about keeping things in perspective look into stress management exercises like deep breathing muscle relaxation and visualization consider whether your child is involved in too many sports or needs to consider switching sports look into other options in the end some kids simply don t enjoy sports or team sports in particular despite the benefits of experiencing a team dynamic the problems may simply outweigh them in such cases you may need to seek out other options for your child at least for the benefit of his or her health and fitness 6 x research source if team sports are simply not in the cards for your child look into sports with more of an individual focus like tennis or golf if the competitive aspect is more of a problem emphasize aerobic exercises like swimming running or biking for the health benefits make sure it s fun most kids who enjoy sports want to be with their friends get a nice uniform to wear and have lots of fun a kid who isn t having fun isn t likely to enjoy playing a sport and is more likely to quit or resist if you have one of the rare sports prodigies out there your priorities may be a bit different but for the most part your primary goal should be to help make sports fun for your child 7 x research source let your child know that it is good to want to win and to try your best to win but that you should be able to have fun win or lose don t talk about the results of the game as much as the fun your child had during it talk about the benefits of sports talk to a reluctant child about why you are encouraging him or her to play sports don t make it seem like you re just forcing them to try something without a good explanation let your kid know about your own positive experiences playing sports but place the primary focus on the good things being active in sports can offer him or her you probably already know that sports can help teach important qualities like motivation discipline commitment cooperation perseverance and resiliency talk to your kid about how developing these skills can help with schoolwork making friends dealing with good and bad days and other day to day experiences don t forget to mention the health benefits as well things like increased energy for instance 8 x research source be a positive influence some parents seem like they can t help but try to relive their athletic lives through their children perhaps they see an opportunity to achieve the success they could not quite reach this can lead to pushing a kid to start or keep playing a certain sport shouting negative comments during games and harsh criticism afterward allow your child to play the sport for him or herself and be vigilant about remaining a positive supporting influence 9 x research source after a bad game don t let the first thing out of your mouth be how could you drop that fly ball instead take a positive instructive track i like how you hustled after the ball when things went wrong and kept your head in the game offer a little one on one practice time let your kid know that effort is more important than results winning is everything is for the pros coach don t criticize coaches for kids teams should be instructors and cheerleaders not drill sergeants if you are coaching your kid s team or are evaluating potential coaches for your kid look for a ratio of at least three positive comments way to go great effort for every one constructive criticism let s work together on that free throw motion some more 10 x research source don t be afraid to talk to your kid s coach if he or she is being too negative or is sapping the fun from the game some youth coaches can get caught up in the tough guy image they think coaches are supposed to have and can lose sight of themselves sometimes it may just be best to remove your child from the team and find a better situation if so explain why this is necessary and is not the same as quitting accept quitting with conditions sometimes despite your best efforts and those of your child you ll find that a certain sport is simply a bad fit if your child really wants to quit first talk about the importance of sticking things out for the rest of the season as a way to honor the commitment he or she made to his or her teammates immediate quitting should be saved whenever possible for times when your child s physical or emotional health is being affected 11 x research source be clear with your child that if he or she does quit that time needs to be replaced with a beneficial activity not sitting on the couch consider other sports or some other type of physical activity a dance class ice skating lessons etc,Sports-and-Fitness
how to do off balance exercise,off balance exercise includes exercises that require you to balance on one leg as well as exercises performed on an unstable surface when it comes to unstable surface training the jury s still out as to whether it will improve your future performance and lessen the risk of future injury however for certain sports off balance training can provide small gains in speed and agility and decrease your risk of injury off balance exercise is further beneficial for those who want to retrain their balance after an injury or because of an ongoing health condition,learn to brace your abdomen if you ve ever been in a yoga or pilates class you ve probably heard that you should draw your navel toward your spine to activate your core however bracing is generally a better method to activate your core for stability and balancing purposes 1 x research source bracing does a better job of activating your entire core than the hollowing action of drawing your navel to your spine to properly brace your abdomen think of how you would brace yourself if someone was about to punch you in the gut start with one legged balances a one legged balance is a beginning exercise to help get you used to off balance exercises and practice activating your core to maintain stability when doing off balance exercises 2 x research source stand with your feet together then lift one foot a few inches off the ground hold your foot up for a minute or two then switch and do the other foot practice this exercise with your eyes open and with your eyes closed activate your core to maintain your balance and try not to lean or wobble you may want to do this with a stable chair or table nearby when you re just starting do leg swings once you ve mastered the one legged balance you can increase the difficulty by lifting each foot and swinging it forward and back focus on moving your leg only keeping your spine neutral and not moving your torso 3 x research source to start touch your foot on the floor in the middle to re stabilize as you get better with this exercise you can try it without touching the floor do 5 to 10 repetitions with each foot try a one legged clock balance a one legged clock balance will help you integrate your upper and lower body to better strengthen your balance and stability which will help you with more challenging off balance exercises 4 x research source to do this exercise stand on one leg and imagine your arms are the arms of a clock start at 12 with your arms straight overhead then point to 3 o clock try to swoop down to 9 o clock without losing your balance then come back up to 12 if you re exercising with a partner have them call out hours for you to point to with your arms since you don t know what s coming this makes the exercise more difficult be sure to do this exercise balancing on the other leg as well add an off balance element to standard strength training exercises once your balance has improved to the point that you can easily balance on one leg you can add an off balance element to virtually any strength training exercise 5 x research source for example if you normally do squats you can do one legged squats by pointing one leg out front as you go into your squat remember to do both legs you also can do weight training exercises such as dead lifts with one leg however make sure your balance is strong before moving to off balance weight training exercises it s typically best to have a spotter when lifting weights while balancing on one leg add back leg raises and side leg raises back leg raises can help strengthen your glutes and buttocks to help improve your balance while side leg raises will strengthen your hips and thighs as well when you first start you might want to keep a sturdy chair or table nearby that you can use for support 6 x research source to do back leg raises stand on one leg and raise the other leg backward keeping your torso straight and activating your core lower the leg back to the floor in a slow controlled movement do two to three sets of 10 leg raises with each leg do side leg raises the same as back leg raises only raise your leg to the side rather than backward avoid leaning when you do this exercise keeping your torso straight do two or three sets of 10 move to planks planks are the classic exercise to activate and strengthen the muscles in your core strengthening your core will enable you to improve your balance so you can successfully complete off balance exercises to do a standard plank lie on your stomach on the floor with your wrists directly below your shoulders tuck your toes under and raise up so that you are on your hands and toes with your body forming a straight line from your heels to the crown of your head brace your abdomen to hold the position if a full plank is too difficult for you start by getting onto your knees and elbows with your forearms flat on the floor try to hold the plank for as long as you are able without experiencing neck back or shoulder pain then lower yourself to the floor in a slow and controlled manner work with a trainer if you are an athlete and are adding off balance exercises to your training regimen to help prevent future sports injuries working with a trainer is essential a trainer with experience in your particular sport knows which off balance exercises will best benefit you doing the wrong off balance exercises as an athlete can actually increase your risk of injury and cause a decrease in your performance overall use a bosu ball and a stability ball a bosu ball is generally a half of a stability ball with a flat surface on the other side both of these pieces of training equipment can be used to do off balance exercises that will improve your stability and can enhance your overall athletic performance 7 x research source when using a bosu ball start by standing on the rounded or ball surface once you are comfortable with the tool try flipping the ball over so that you stand on the flat part move to exercise only when you are comfortable standing on both the flat and rounded parts these pieces of equipment originally were used for rehabilitation after injuries adding them to your training regimen can also strengthen the stability of your joints to lower your risk of future injury for example you might do lunges or squats on a bosu ball do three sets of 10 repetitions of these exercises try to hold the squat or lunge position for several seconds and activate your core to maintain balance incorporate split stance and one leg exercises one leg exercises are the standard off balance exercises that require you to activate your core to maintain your balance however split stance exercises may be more beneficial for preventing sports injuries split stance exercises are still considered off balance exercises because you re shifting the center of your mass further away from your base of support with split stance exercises however you keep both feet on the floor so you re not exercising from an unstable surface which can increase your risk of knee injuries try balance or wobble board exercises balance and wobble board exercises are frequently prescribed for rehabilitation from a sports injury regular balance and wobble board training can improve your understanding of your joint position to prevent injuries to your ankles or knees 8 x research source a balance or wobble board is simply a board with a rounded bottom that you can either stand on or do simple exercises such as squats or lunges the uneven surface will cause you to wobble as you exercise forcing you to engage your core to maintain your balance talk to your health care provider if you have had an injury or have a medical condition that causes vertigo or chronic dizziness you may benefit from balance retraining exercises however you should not start an off balance exercise program without consulting your doctor 9 x research source your doctor will be able to recommend specific exercises that you should do or may send you to a physical therapist shake your head while walking to recalibrate your internal balance and equilibrium after it has been damaged due to an injury or medical condition you ll start by simply shaking and nodding your head while standing still move your head slowly if you have recently experienced neck or spinal issues or if you have a chronic condition in those areas 10 x research source if you can accomplish this while standing without getting dizzy or losing balance you can transition to walking as you walk shake your head from side to side and then nod up and down you should practice this exercise both with your eyes open and with your eyes closed however if you re walking with your eyes closed it s generally best to have a spotter with you in case you do lose your balance so you won t fall practice walking heel to toe you may recognize the heel toe walking technique as part of a roadside sobriety test walking heel to toe in a straight line can improve your balance and coordination 11 x research source simply walk forward in a straight line heel to toe for 20 steps then walk backward the same 20 steps repeat two to three times you can hold your arms out at your side to steady yourself but ultimately you should get to the point where you can do this without the assistance of your arms for balance shake your head while standing on one leg if you ve progressed to the point that you re able to stand on one leg without losing your balance add a head shake to bring the balance system of your brain into action 12 x research source stand on one leg with the other foot in front of you a few inches off the floor then shake your head gently side to side and up and down as when you shook your head while walking you should do these exercises both with your eyes open and with your eyes closed keep a stable object nearby in case you lose your balance you also might want to have a spotter or skilled therapist working with you do this exercise for one minute then switch legs work with a wobble board if you have access to a wobble board at a gym you can use it to increase your stability and improve your overall balance to start make sure you have a sturdy chair or table nearby that you can use to stabilize your upper body 13 x research

the stick s shaft is even with the pencil line extend the pencil line to equal the entire length of the stick s shaft it s possible for you to do this alone but it is a bit easier with a second set of hands to help out use adhesive strips to hang your stick without damaging the wall peel the backing off one side of 3 4 removable adhesive strips space them out evenly along the side of the stick that will be against the wall and press them firmly in place peel the backing off the other side of the strips and use the level line on the wall as your guide as you firmly press the stick into place 3m command strips are one of the most well known brands of removable adhesive strips no matter which brand you choose follow the product instructions for specific guidance removable adhesive strips that incorporate hook and loop such as velcro closures in between the adhesive elements are best for this application as they make it easier to remove the stick and the strips from the wall the average modern adult size hockey stick weighs only around 2 lb 910 g which is well within the holding range of 3 4 large removable adhesive strips find 2 wall studs along the level line if you re not using adhesive strips use a battery powered stud finder to locate 2 wooden framing studs behind the finished wall along your level line mark these stud locations with a pencil so you can drill directly into the studs when hanging your hockey stick stud finders typically light up and beep when they pass over studs in the u s wall studs are typically located 16 in 41 cm apart with some practice you may be able to find them simply by tapping on the wall with your knuckle or a hammer you ll hear a duller thud when you re over a stud if you can t find 2 studs where you need them install plastic wall anchors that expand and hold tight when you drive a screw into them buy and install stick mounting brackets so you can swap out sticks hold the display mounts which are usually blocky c shaped plastic clips over the marked stud locations mark the screw locations with a pencil and drill pilot holes into the wall studs with a power drill use a screwdriver to secure the mounts to the wall with screws then press the stick into the mounts until it snaps in place search for hockey stick mounting brackets for buying options follow the specific installation instructions for the brackets you purchase to display a different stick simply pull the old stick free from the clips and pop in a new one screw the stick directly to the wall for a permanent and seamless setup hold the stick up to the wall along the level line blade pointed up and transfer the marked stud locations to the stick s shaft use a power drill to drill pilot holes through the center of the stick s shaft at these market locations hold the stick back up to the wall stick a pencil through the pilot holes in the stick and mark your drilling locations on the wall drill pilot holes in the wall studs then use a screwdriver to secure the stick to the wall with screws while this method involves drilling holes into the stick it also secures the stick flush against the wall for a more streamlined look put your hockey cards in clear display sleeves or cases rigid display sleeves or cases are best here not floppy plastic sleeves use common top loading sports card display sleeves for lower value cards and high end uv protected magnetic or screw tightened display cases for higher value cards 7 x research source if you re displaying high value hockey cards on the wall make sure they re in uv protected sleeves and won t be in direct sunlight stick the covered cards to the wall lined up above the stick s shaft use the stick s shaft to line up the bottoms of all the cards but keep them in place by sticking them to the wall itself use poster putty or mounting tape to secure the cards in place 8 x research source the cards will look like they re resting along the top of the hockey stick but they will be more securely in place because they re attached to the wall mount multiple hockey sticks in parallel to display several rows of hockey cards on a single wall,Sports-and-Fitness
how to keep your balance while spinning,whether you re dancing skydiving or spending the day riding rollercoasters it s important to stay balanced while you spin or rotate staying balanced will not only keep you from falling but it will also prevent you from getting dizzy or sick luckily keeping your balance is pretty easy if you can control your head and adjust your center of gravity while you spin if you re struggling to stay balanced and feel like you re spinning when you walk or stand see your doctor since vertigo and dizziness are symptoms of several underlying issues,focus on a single spot while you spin to fend off any dizziness choose an object or item that will be easy to recognize as you re turning this could be a light source a painting or a chair but you can realistically use anything while you re spinning keep your eyes on this object whenever it s in your field of vision to avoid getting dizzy 1 x research source this should be pretty easy if you re dancing or spinning in place if you re on an amusement ride or playing sports though you may need to choose a different object from time to time as you move the further away this object is the easier it will be to track distinct clouds or large buildings on the horizon are excellent for this whip your head around while spinning and return to the point of focus as the object you re looking at slips out of your field of vision you won t be able to focus on the object you re using as your point of reference the best way to handle this portion of the spin is actually to turn your head quickly in the direction that you re spinning to get back to that single spot as fast as possible move your neck smoothly and quickly to get back to the spot you chose 3 x research source don t turn your head so fast that you hurt yourself this is more of a smooth spin than a snapping motion keep your head tilted at the same angle to make focusing easier while looking at your point of reference do not move your head up or down unless it s necessary keeping your head on the same plane throughout the duration of the spin will make it harder for your inner ear to get disoriented it will also lower the amount of work your eyes have to do to when it comes to finding your point of reference 4 x research source this is still true if you re on a rollercoaster or moving up and down at the same time as you re spinning keeping your head tilted the same way in relation to your body not the up or down motion will really help you stay balanced swap to looking straight ahead if you notice your eyes flickering when you spin your eyes naturally try to track the movement of the horizon if you lose track of your object or you start to spin way too fast your eyes naturally tick back and forth to try and find the horizon line when this happens forget the object you were looking at you won t be able to track it instead try to look straight ahead with your pupils in the center of your eyes 5 x research source looking straight ahead is considerably easier than tracking an object as you spin it s not as efficient as looking at a reference point but it s much better than letting your eyes flicker the flickering eyes will make you really dizzy and throw you totally off balance if you can t get them to stop close your eyes if you get vertigo or become dizzy after spinning if you start to feel sick while you re spinning stop if you can sit down and close your eyes closing your eyes will help reduce the symptoms from the spin as your body readjusts you can also do this if you re on an amusement ride or roller coaster and start to feel ill while you spin 6 x research source vertigo refers to the lingering feeling that the world is spinning while you re standing still it can lead to extended dizziness nausea or vomiting if it goes on for too long it s pretty normal to get dizzy after excessive spinning if you get dizzy or off balance when you aren t actively spinning though see your doctor this may be a symptom of some underlying condition 7 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source spin and turn your head at a uniform speed to stay consistent if you re in control of the spin do not accelerate and slow down repeatedly try to spin at the exact same speed throughout the duration of the movement this will make it much easier for you to monitor your balance as you rotate 8 x research source if you re dancing you re more likely to lose your balance if you start or stop a spin abruptly it can be fairly difficult to control your body if you don t give yourself a buffer when you start or stop a spin your arms can also help you control your speed the further out your arms are the slower you ll spin keep your spine as straight as possible to avoid falling over when you spin you may want to lean forward to slow yourself down you can do this if you really need to cool your speed and you re perfectly balanced but tilting your spine while spinning may knock you off balance while you rotate keep your spine as vertical as possible so that you stay completely upright and don t lose balance 9 x research source getting closer to the floor may make you feel safer but it may also make it harder to keep your balance since it increases your speed tighten your abs to make it easier to control your movement unless you re bending over your core controls your center of gravity flexing your abs keeps your spine straight and makes it easier to stabilize yourself as you spin tighten your abdominal muscles while you move to control your spine and stay balanced 10 x research source hold your arms out to stabilize yourself while spinning lift your arms up away from you and use them to keep your balance while spinning the further out your arms are the slower you ll spin if you find yourself falling to the left raise your left arm and lower the right do the reverse if you find you start falling in the other direction 11 x research source you can also put your hands out in front of you or lean them back a little if necessary this tends to be harder to do though this works because you re shifting a small amount of your weight when you move your arms shifting your arms makes it easier to make minor adjustments to your center of gravity while you move bend your knees a little and keep your feet spread apart if you can the further your feet are spread out the wider you base is this will reduce the odds you fall while you re playing a sport or on an amusement ride bending your knees a little will lower your center of gravity and help you stabilize 12 x research source you may not be able to do this if you re dancing where you need to perform a specific maneuver with your feet together or knees locked locking your knees in an upright position also makes it harder for your blood to flow you may experience a dizzy spell or faint if you keep your knees locked for too long practice spinning every day to desensitize yourself to the motion the main reason dancers don t get dizzy is because their brains are used to it regardless of the dancing you re doing practice your spins every day to get used to keeping your balance put your dancing shoes on go into the biggest uncarpeted room in your home and practice spinning in place to train your brain to not get dizzy 13 x research source don t overdo it so badly that you re getting nauseous a simple 10 to 15 minute training session is more than enough to help your brain get used to spinning do practice rotations to commit your spins to muscle memory get into your practice room and lift the heel of your pivot foot off of the ground hold your arms out gently at your sides twist your torso back and forth for 3 times before turning 90 degrees use your upper chest to lead the spin and hold your head in place for as long as possible before whipping it to match your chest rotate your legs on the ball of your foot and let your legs follow your chest do this 20 25 times a day to practice controlling your spins 14 x research source twisting your upper body trains you to lead with your chest every time you spin letting your legs follow your chest reinforces that your chest goes first to initiate a spin keeping your head in the same position and whipping it around last trains you to hold your eyes on a point of reference push yourself up on one foot to strengthen the heel and practice balancing head into your practice room and stand with your feet next to one another raise one foot off of the floor and lift your body up on the ball of your other foot hold this for 3 5 seconds to strengthen your heels and practice staying stable repeat this process 20 25 times on each foot to get used to balancing when you turn 15 x research source this will

how to stop an over swing,in golf an overswing is when you swing your club too far back on your backswing when the shaft of the club goes past being parallel with the ground on your backswing this is considered an overswing this usually occurs when you try to swing the club too hard using your arms instead of your core and lower body an overswing results in a poor shot that often slices off to one side instead of trying to swing your club as hard as you can focus more on using the correct form and swinging from your hips try some different drills to help you learn how the proper rotation and form for a shorter swing feel with some practice you should be able to correct your overswing and see a noticeable improvement in your golf game,hold your golf club like normal then remove your non dominant hand place a golf ball on the ground in front of you and get into your normal golf stance hold your club with your regular two handed grip then take your non dominant hand off the club 1 x

drill can help you and your muscle memory learn how an ideal swing using proper form should feel note that you are not actually going to hit the ball in this drill you are just going to practice rotating back and learning how it should feel having a ball on the ground just helps you visualize your form bend your dominant arm straight up while holding the club place your non dominant arm behind your back and focus only on the arm holding the club keep your elbow directly in front of your rib cage and bend your arm up so that your golf club is pointed straight up in the air 2 x

at your hips as if you re swinging the club back above your head but don t move your arm or the club at all stop twisting when the club is above your head and about 3 4 of the way towards being completely parallel to the ground 3 x research source this will help you get the feel of how a shorter backswing should feel overswing often occurs because you re swinging the club with your arms too much and flaring your elbow out on your backswing rather than using your hips to swing the club while keeping your elbow tucked in tightly hold a golf ball in your dominant hand stand in a golf stance but don t hold a golf club grab a golf ball with your dominant hand and hold it in your fist like it s the handle of a golf club 4 x research source for example if you re right handed hold the ball in your right hand this is the hand of what s called your non lead arm which is the arm furthest back from your target swing the golf ball up like you re swinging a club bend your arm up at the elbow at about a 45 degree angle and keep your elbow tight in front of your rib cage rotate back at your hips until the golf ball is above your head and your fist is about 3 4 of the way parallel to the ground 5 x research source imagine you re holding a golf club and focus on keeping your form controlled and smooth bring your arm down like your swinging a club at a golf ball on the ground rotate back towards the front with your hips shifting your weight forward as you do so start unbending your elbow as your hand comes down towards the zone where your imaginary club would impact a ball on the ground which is called the impact zone 6 x research source note that this drill should be done all in one fluid motion just like you re swinging a golf club toss the ball underhand when your hand reaches the impact zone release the ball in an underhand toss as if you just hit the ball with your imaginary club straightening out your arm across your body as you do so watch the direction the ball flies in to assess your swing 7 x research source if the ball flies forward at a right angle to your body you re not overswinging if it flies out straight in front of you or slices to the left you re overswinging practice this drill until you can throw the ball forward at a right angle to your body just like how you would want the ball to travel if you were hitting it with a club this will help you learn how proper rotation and arm movement should feel to avoid overswinging swing your club back until it is parallel to the ground then pause get into your normal golf stance with a golf ball on the ground in front of you then rotate back at your hips to swing your club back above your head bend your elbows slightly at the top of your backswing so the shaft is approximately parallel with the ground stop at the top of this backswing with the club up above your head to get in your starting position for this drill 8 x research source this drill will help you practice using your thighs glutes hips and core to swing the club instead of your arms make sure your feet are still planted firmly and your knees are pointing forward your hips should be turned at about a 45 degree angle and your shoulders should be turned at about a 90 degree angle start your downswing using only your hips ankles and knees begin to swing the club down by rotating forward at your hips and shifting your weight forward onto your ankles and knees the club will come back down towards the golf ball without any need to swing it using your arms unbend your elbows as the club comes down into the impact zone 9 x research source overswing is often caused by using your arms to uncoil the golf club on your downswing so focusing on using your core for all your swinging power will help correct this do not let your wrists bend or use your shoulders and arms for power at all hit the ball as hard as you can using only your core to swing the club keep your arms tight to your body until after you hit the ball keep uncoiling your backswing with just your core until you strike the ball then straighten your arms all the way out away from your chest halfway through your follow through swing 10 x research source if you regularly overswing using this technique will feel like you re swinging at about half the strength of your normal swing since you normally swing with your arms too even though it might feel like you re swinging really short you ll actually get a lot more power by focusing on swinging the club with your core plus you ll have better form so the ball will travel straight and far,Sports-and-Fitness

how to test bow poundage,bow poundage usually called draw weight is the amount of force required to draw the bowstring back to a normal shooting position poundage means that this weight is measured in pounds but you could also use kilograms or ounces having the right draw weight is important for good bow and arrow performance especially if you re a competitor sometimes the weight needs adjustment if the string is too difficult or easy to draw back 1 x research source luckily checking the draw weight is easy you can either use a manual or digital scale to take a measurement after this you ll know if your bow has a good draw weight or needs some maintenance,slide the scale indicator back to the starting position a standard bow scale looks like a long tube with a hook on the end an indicator along the side of the tube shows the poundage of your draw if this isn t in the zero position when you start slide it back into the start position for an accurate measurement 2 x research source it s possible for the spring in the scale to wear out and give you an inaccurate measurement if your scale is starting to give inconsistent measurements then you probably need a replacement spring a professional at a bow shop should be able to replace it for you place your middle and index fingers on the scale finger rests on the front of the scale there are 2 finger rests that make a small t shape place your index finger on the top one and your middle finger on the bottom one then wrap your thumb and other fingers around the tube 3 x research source use the hand that you usually draw your bow with if you re right handed then hold it in your right hand make sure the numbers on the scale face you otherwise your hand might block the indicator 4 x research source hook the scale around the arrow nook on the string at the end of the bow scale where your fingers are there is a rounded hook loop this around the bowstring in the same place that you d put an arrow 5 x research source test to make sure the scale is attached a few times before you draw it back fully pull back a bit to make sure the hook doesn t come loose hold the bow up with your arm stretched out straight grab the bow handle with your free arm and lift it into your normal shooting position for most people this means that your lead arm should be straight and in line with your elbow hold the scale in position like it s an arrow 6 x research source don t point the bow at any people or things that could break if you let go of the scale you could shoot it like an arrow some professionals like to nock an arrow while they re measuring the poundage to mimic their draw length when they re actually shooting however if you re not experienced using a bow scale don t do this if you release the string accidentally you could shoot the arrow pull the string back smoothly until you reach your normal draw length draw the string as if you were getting ready to shoot an arrow continue until you reach your normal draw length for most people this is right around their ear hold it in position for a few seconds to take a measurement 7 x research source do not let go of the scale at any point if you feel like you re losing your grip then release the tension slowly let the tension off of the string smoothly don t simply let go of the bow or scale while you have the string drawn this could send the scale flying instead bring your drawing arm forward at an even pace until there s no more tension on the string 8 x research source check the indicator line on the bow scale to measure the poundage the indicator on the scale will measure the poundage of your draw check the number that it s pointing to and you ll know the poundage of your draw 9 x research source slide the indicator back to zero so you re ready for the next measurement you might want to check 2 or 3 times to confirm your first measurement set the scale to pounds if you have the option some digital scales can cycle between different units of measure look for a button labeled unit and press it until the scale says pounds as its unit of measure 10 x research source you can also use a different unit of measure if you d like always check the instructions on the scale you re using for the proper procedure some scales have on switches and others might simply activate when you press a button press the tare button to zero the scale on most digital scales the tare button sets the scale back to zero hit this before every measurement to make sure your scale gets an accurate measurement 11 x research source hang the scale on a secure mount on the ceiling you need to hang the scale from something strong that will stay in place while you pull the bow some people use a chain or secure ropes and others drill a hook directly into their ceiling this will all work as long as it can support enough weight loop the circular attachment on the scale into this mount 12 x research source many bows have a draw weight of over 60 lb 27 kg so you need a mount that can hold at least that much weight do not use a nail or screw in the ceiling to secure the scale these aren t strong enough and could pop out hook the scale around your bow string in the arrow section take your bow and place it into the scale hook in the same place you d nock and arrow make sure the string is secure before trying to pull it 13 x research source pull the bow all the way down smoothly grab the bow firmly with one hand on either side of the handle then pull it down with firm pressure to measure its weight stop when the scale stops increasing which indicates that you ve hit the max draw weight 14 x research source an electric scale automatically measures the max draw weight on the string so even if you pull it too far this won t make a difference raise the bow back up with steady pressure remember that the bow is under tension so don t let it go or it ll shoot up raise the blow smoothly to release the tension when you re back in the starting position you can let it go or take it off the hook 15 x research source check the measurement on the scale the scale saves and displays the last measurement it took check the screen to see the poundage of your bow 16 x research source you can confirm your measurement by measuring a few more times remember to hit tare to set it back to zero regardless of the bow s poundage if you can t pull it back to your full draw comfortably then it s too heavy and needs adjustment 17 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness

them,warm up with jumping exercises jumping can help kids build the muscles they need to be strong runners before you begin to practice running lead the kids through a set of jumping jacks or let them use a jump rope check their form while they run in place ask kids to run in place as hard as they can for five seconds watch their form and see if they have any weakness good sprinting form means 1 x research source pushing with the front foot leaning forward so that the feet are behind the hips and the hips behind the shoulders also known as the triple extension keeping the torso vertical holding the head still and relaxing the face bending the elbows at right angles keeping the arms close to the sides as they pump up and down lifting the front knee high while straightening the back leg model proper technique for them if you notice any issues right away say so then run in place together with the kids mention how you are using correct form they can watch you to see the right way to do things and you can watch them to check for improvement 2 x research source help the kids visualize what good running feels like giving kids little reminders of what to do while running makes a big difference for instance tell the kids to imagine that their feet are pushing their hips forward this helps them remember that most of the force for sprinting should come from the feet pushing away from the ground 3 x research source you could also tell the kids to imagine they are holding a bird in each hand as they run that way they remember to keep their hands closed but not clenched give them verbal cues have the kids practice sprinting as they run call out reminders to focus on the aspects of form they need to work on in order to improve for instance 4 x research source if you have a kid who doesn t swing their arms wide enough call out hip to lip as they run that will remind them to swing the arms all the way from the sides up toward their face if a kid isn t lifting their legs enough call out knees up knees up set a running goal a kid will really improve only if they want to make sure a kid is actually interested in learning to run faster and talk about why they want to then set an appropriate goal 5 x research source for instance if a kid plays another sport like basketball they might be interested in running faster to improve their performance remind them of this occasionally set goals that focus on improvement rather than winning aiming to shave a second off of a 40 yard dash is a more manageable goal than wanting to win the state championship keep track of the kids progress for instance you could keep a graph or chart that records the kids 40 yard dash times over 6 months if the kids can visualize how they ve started to improve they ll be more motivated to keep trying and make further progress 6 x research source make sure to time the kids during drills so you can track their progress don t push them too hard learning to run faster doesn t happen overnight it takes patience and lots of practice if you push kids too hard or try to rush their training they will get discouraged and not improve focus instead on making incremental progress through regular practice 7 x research source only practice sprinting 3 4 times a week a kid can get worn out if they practice too frequently mix up practice sessions so that some days are focused on playing sports that get good running practice in like soccer football basketball and kickball this also makes practice more fun complementary activities like weight lifting yoga and swimming are good for overall athletic development but to improve running speed its best to prioritize activities that provide sprinting opportunities mix games into practice sessions just doing drills over again gets boring and demoralizing luckily it s easy to work sprinting into a variety of games for instance get the kids together and try things like an old school game of tag a relay race a game of red light green light make time for playing other sports running is a major component of many sports if the kids get some run time in playing something like soccer it will help them improve even if it isn t technically sprinting practice plus mixing things up keeps everyone interested sports that have good opportunities for running include 8 x research source baseball soccer basketball kickball dodgeball run with the kid a coach doesn t have to just stand on the sidelines getting out there and running with the kid gives them moral support shows them you re willing to work hard too and is lots of fun you can run drills or play games together for instance if the kid is interested you could even run a race together 9 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to make your child a good hockey player,this is for parents who would like their child to become a good hockey player and enjoy the sport these guidelines apply to both roller and ice hockey,keep in mind that the main point is to have fun don t expect that he or she is going to go pro as very few do encouraging your child to get better is because it s fun to be good at what you do it s not for trying to get your child pro 1 x research source make sure that your kid knows that hockey isn t always going to be fun and easy you have to be the one to make sure that when it gets hard and miserable for your child he she can count on you to make it fun again start at a young age the younger your child starts to play the better there s a definite pattern the better hockey players are the ones who started earlier take your child to open skates learn to play programs and stick and pucks emphasize practicing stick handling 2 x research source enroll your child in a club early this will give your child a huge advantage with selection for school teams enroll your child in a house league 3 x research source when you enroll in a club try to get them to join with a group of friends this will make it much more enjoyable get them a good hockey kit this will raise their morale and see that you treat their participation in the sport seriously make sure their equipment is not what you want but what they want make sure their equipment fits correctly and protects them at young ages it doesn t need to be big and bulky your child needs to be able to move and turn don t spend too much as they will be needing new equipment all the time also make sure that their equipment isn t way better way more expensive than the other kids at their club as it will be embarrassing for them however if the child becomes the best player in a school club later on then it s okay for them to have the best equipment encourage their interest by taking them to see national hockey games and other game plays treat these as fun occasions out for the whole family 4 x research source encourage your child to practice if he or she likes to play video games or go on the computer limit it to either an hour a day or one day a week get your child to practice instead 5 x research source at young ages focus on quantity of ice time over quality the more time your child has on the ice the better don t push them ask them and encourage them this is roller hockey s big advantage over ice your street is a practice place but roller hockey is also excellent training for ice hockey so make use of both encourage good sportsmanship from an early age this is key to being a good team player and having the support of other team members 6 x research source encourage passing even if your child is one of the best always encourage him her to pass why for one everyone will like your child as a team player more also unselfish players are much more valuable to a travel team than selfish ones passing is one of the most important skills in hockey recognizing if someone is open or not is one skill as is making the passes hard and accurate passing is how hockey is played in the nhl you rarely see someone hold onto the puck for more than 2 seconds teach your child to keep his or her head up show an interest this means watching their games and practices cheer but don t get super competitive and embarrass them travel if your child is a good player and enjoy the sport it may be a good idea to put her or him in travel when she or he qualifies for 10u 8u travel is frankly a waste of money for the travelling and tournament fees 7 x research source continue advancing if it s warranted as your child moves up the age groups in travel keep encouraging him her but don t put too much pressure on your child,Sports-and-Fitness
how to introduce kids to ice hockey,ice hockey is a fun sport that is popular in many regions of the world however it can be an intimidating sport for people especially children to learn fortunately there are a variety of things you can do to introduce kids to ice hockey and to make the game seem appealing by educating kids about the game helping them learn to skate and perfecting key aspects of the game you ll be able to help your kids gain an appreciation for ice hockey,watch a game with them by watching a game they ll have the first hand experience of watching professionals play this will not only be instructional but it may make the game seem exciting take your kids to a live professional or semi professional hockey game for example if you live in the atlanta metropolitan area you can take your kids to an atlanta gladiators game a minor league ice hockey team watch a professional hockey game on television in north america the national hockey league s regular season runs from october to april attend a children s hockey game this way your kids will be able to see people their own age playing and having fun 1 x research source explain important rules by taking enough time to explain the rules before after or during a game you ll help kids learn the basics so they understand what they re seeing and how to play in the future tell them that the rink is split up into three zones the defending zone for each team and a middle or neutral zone each team is only allowed to have five skaters and one goalie on the ice two skaters play defense while three are offensive players the goalie is not allowed to allowed to cross the center line of the rink pee wee hockey players below age 11 are not allowed to body check which means using their body to stop an opponent from moving in addition no one is ever allowed to do a body check that meets another person s head major infractions or penalties include tripping holding using a stick to stop a player from moving using a stick to hit someone in the head or face elbowing kneeing or generally being rough find a league for them to play in the single best way to introduce kids to ice hockey is to sign them up with a team or league after they join a league they ll have others to play with a coach to teach them and the ability to participate in organized competitions look for a local or regional league for them to play in depending on your region your public school system might have an ice hockey team leagues and teams will depend on age for instance pee wee hockey is typically 12 years and younger 2 x research source show the child how to fall down knowing how to fall down is a necessity when playing ice hockey without knowing how to fall a child could seriously hurt themselves as a result instruct your kid about how to fall when falling a child should bend their knees lean to the side fall slowly when they are ready 3 x research source teach them how to get up after falling a child will need to get back up to continue playing this though could be just as difficult and dangerous as falling down as a result instruct your child about how to get back up when they are ready they should kneel on both knees keep their back straight put one skate on the ice push down with the same knee push up and put the other skate on the ice 4 x research source begin with small movements once a child has learned how to fall and get back up they need to master moving around the ice it is important that they start small and start slow so they don t get hurt or discouraged tell your child to stand steady and have them put their hands out in front and pointed down to help with balance this might look as if the child is pushing downward toward the floor lift a single foot and put it down slightly in front of the other lift the other foot and place it down in front of where it was repeat and slowly increase the speed of their movements 5 x research source show them how to slow and stop as your child learns how to skate faster it ll be increasingly important that they can slow down and come to a stop thus you need to make sure they can come to a stop without hurting themselves instruct them how to shave ice by standing steady and pushing their blades outward tell them to advance to a medium speed and prepare to stop have them bend their knees and move their hands downward in front of them as they prepare to slow to stop tell them to bring their toes together and plow the ice tell them to apply their weight to one leg and have the other leg push the skate outward to shave the ice 6 x research source show them how to hold a hockey stick holding a stick properly is one of the most important elements of playing ice hockey if a child does not hold the stick properly they won t be able to take successful shots may sustain injuries to themselves or hurt others tell your child to place the dominant hand on the top grip of the stick put the other hand about an elbows distance from the top hand lower on the stick always hold the stick low to the ground instruct them on how to pass the puck once a child has mastered holding a stick and skating they should practice passing and shooting pucks ultimately a child will need to follow a couple fundamental rules when shooting tell them to skate toward the puck with their top hand facing out from their body roll their wrist when they hit the puck put power into the shot make sure the blade stays low over the ice when taking a shot and afterward 7 x research source talk to them about safety as a very physical sport where contact between children and the ice may occur often children should take ice hockey safety very seriously without following basic safety protocols a child or someone else could be hurt children should use a proper helmet helmets should be foam lined and should fit properly wear a face mask use padding like shoulder chest elbow leg knee and shin pads remember heads up don t duck hockey players should not duck their heads when they anticipate a collision this could cause spinal cord injuries 8 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to protect kids playing contact sports,sports are fun as well as great experience kids who play sports will learn lasting lessons about being active but also about cooperation adversity and respect however some sports contact sports like football lacrosse and hockey are more risky than others as a parent or coach you can help protect kids in these sports by ensuring that they have the right equipment play safely and aren t over exposed to contact,wear the right gear contact sports usually require some kind of protective equipment i e pads helmets shin guards facemasks and others this is for good reason no one should participate in a contact sport without proper gear make sure that your children or players are all sporting the right items 1 x research source in soccer for example players wear shin guards covered with long socks in high contact sports like american football and hockey the gear covers almost all the body helmet shoulder and abdominal pads elbow and knee pads and sometimes shin guards make sure that the equipment fits properly usually this means that the item covers the area it is meant to protect it should also be snug do not let kids grow into equipment 2 x research source gear should be in good condition kids should never wear cracked or broken pieces of equipment inspect gear frequently to catch and replace broken items use helmets or head protection helmets protect kids most important body part during contact sports the head and brain studies show that concussions are much more damaging than we once thought and children are especially vulnerable 3 x research source using proper head protection is vital always use helmets designed for the sport you re playing a football helmet is not appropriate for hockey rugby or boxing 4 x research source check to be sure that the helmets meet safety standards set by the federal consumer product safety commission use head guards even in light contact sports players often go without protection in soccer for example despite head blows from heading the ball opt for safety instead helmets should fit snugly on the head and not shift backward or forward sport the right shoes contact sports also require certain kinds of footwear soccer american football lacrosse and other sports use cleated shoes for example while hockey uses ice skates the right footwear will let kids to play the game correctly while avoiding trips and falls 5 x research source replace shoes cleats and skates that are worn out and no longer supportive protect other vulnerable areas don t forget to have players protect other vulnerable areas like the eyes face and mouth these areas are not always included in the formal gear but should be covered as a coach you may have to have kids get certain items on their own 6 x research source 7 x research source football and hockey helmets may already have built in facemasks kids can also get eye shields that attach to the helmet or even protective goggles mouth guards protect the teeth tongue and mouth and sell for a few dollars at sporting goods stores have your kids or players dip the guard into hot water for about a minute then remove and bite down on it this should mould the guard to their teeth make sure players remove retainers before playing too consider a neck guard for hockey to protect against accidental skate cuts boys may need a jockstrap and protective cup for the groin teach the rules and proper techniques in sports rules are in place to protect tell your kids or players to think of them not as limits but as safeguards so that everyone can enjoy the game stay on the field or ice and avoid injury teach proper techniques and behavior as well 8 x research source warn players about all illegal moves and infractions like tripping kneeing chop blocking elbowing and late hits if the sport is american football or rugby kids should also know proper tackling technique in youth football tacklers should have their heads up for example engaging the opponent with the shoulder pads they should not lead with their head for hockey young players might be allowed to body check and should know the right technique too to give a clean check you want your shoulder to make contact with your opponent s chest you are not allowed to hit with your elbows or stick you can t leave your feet and you can t make contact with the head teach kids to be aware at all times as hockey players learn from a young age keep your head up young players should be aware of what s going on at all times during a game even if they are not directly involved in the play not paying attention can in fact lead to accidental or non accidental injuries warn players never to put themselves in vulnerable positions if they can in american football for example the kickoff can be a dangerous play and requires extra awareness 9 x research source wide receivers should be careful about running patterns where they can be blindsided like a crossing route in hockey puck carriers shouldn t look down when stick handling because they open themselves up to devastating body checks hockey players should also be very careful when going into corners to get loose pucks since a check from behind can send them head first into the boards instill respect for others while players have to be aware they also have to pay look out for other players and their safety this is basic respect a player might be able to hit an opponent from the blindside it might even be legal but taking advantage of a vulnerable player is not respectful or good sportsmanship some contact sports have cultures of violence big hits and intimidation are praised players learn by example that they should target opponents lay them out or destroy them as a parent or coach warn and discourage children who make dangerous plays and don t praise them say something like you hit number 20 from behind that was dangerous and illegal it s not ok to take advantage of someone who s vulnerable hit cleanly the next time respect is especially important in sports like hockey and lacrosse where players have sticks teach players that they should never use a stick as a weapon against an opponent limit contact to games want a simple way to reduce injury in contact sports reduce contact you can do this in several ways one of which is by removing contact from everything but the game that means no contact in practice drills or informal scrimmages try going to touch only practices in football in hockey or lacrosse ban hitting in practices and scrimmages limiting contact to games should reduce all kinds of injuries like concussions breaks sprains and muscle tears 10 x research source reducing the number of blows to the head is important particularly as we learn more about the effects of concussions on the brain getting rid of contact in practice could lower the total blows to the brain by ½ a study in football also showed that players take more low level blows to the head in practice than in games 11 x research source alter the rules another way to protect players in contact sports is to alter the rules slightly some people might argue that changing the rules will undermine the game this is not necessarily true hitting and contact are key parts of some games like rugby but it can be reduced in others without affecting the overall sport in a youth league try raising your concerns with league administrators and propose safer rules get rid of heading in your soccer league you ll actually be in line with the us soccer federation s new guidelines for youth leagues 12 x research source lacrosse and hockey are not always played with hitting either and usually restrict body checking until about 12 to 15 years of age women s hockey normally does not allow body checks even at the highest levels 13 x research source switch to flag football some communities in the us have started to eliminate tackle football in favor of non contact kinds at least for kids 14 x research source switch to non contact sports the easiest way to protect kids in sports is to remove contact entirely kids don t need contact in order to benefit from playing a sport they can learn all of the same lessons about teamwork winning losing competition and sportsmanship from non contact kinds consider a team game like baseball basketball or volleyball field hockey is a fun and exciting game as well individual non contact sports are great for exercise and learning too like tennis swimming and track and field events,Sports-and-Fitness
how to help your child progress in hockey,this guide is meant to serve as a basic outline for parents and youth hockey players who have nhl or semi professional hockey dreams or just love to play and would like a good education as a bonus,determine the focus you if you are the player or your child has for the game use the resources of your local youth hockey league or regional nhl team often nhl teams will run summer camps for the youths search the net for players that you want to emulate and read their biographies check their histories read what schools they attended run web searches using the coach s name followed words such as camp or clinic encourage them to watch professional hockey this lets them see all the things that pro s do that they can do practice with them never give up on your child stay patient with them if they really want to stop practicing let them you shouldn t make them do things they don t want to,Sports-and-Fitness
how to throw a boomerang,a boomerang is a type of throwing star which originated in australia as a hunting weapon used by the aboriginal people nowadays the boomerang is used for sport and recreation and is famous for its unique ability to return to the thrower throwing a returning boomerang is a skill which requires a specific technique and plenty of practice making it a feat akin to getting a hole in one on the golf course,start with the proper grip you can hold the boomerang on either arm the lift leading arm or the dingle trailing arm either way make sure that the painted curved side is always facing toward you and the flat side is facing away from you 1 x research source try the pinch grip the pinch grip involves pinching the boomerang between your thumb and index finger you throw the boomerang by flicking your wrist backwards before snapping it forwards this creates enough momentum to pull the boomerang out of your hand and create spin 2 x research source test the cradle grip this grip is similar to the pinch grip except you wrap your index finger or all four fingers around the edge of the boomerang instead grip the boomerang as close to the bottom of the arm as possible and as you throw flick the boomerang with your index finger as if pulling a trigger this helps to create spin 3 x research source find a large open area choose an area where you have at least 50 meters 164 0 ft of space on all sides football fields soccer pitches and open park spaces are all good options make sure there are not too many trees or bushes for your boomerang to get caught in or large bodies of water for it to fall into 4 x research source avoid practicing your boomerang throw in crowded areas or places with a lot of windows or parked cars it can be difficult to predict where your boomerang will land and a mis thrown boomerang can cause significant injury or damage to property 5 x research source you should always throw from the center of an open space this will help you to throw more consistently while also providing some leeway on all sides if the flight of the boomerang doesn t go as planned 6 x research source watch out for weather conditions wind is one of the most important factors in the proper return of a boomerang ideally you want a nice calm day with winds between 0 to 10 mph 16 km h some boomerangs will not return in completely calm weather but most will avoid throwing your boomerang in high winds as it will distort the path of the boomerang and throw it off course 7 x research source light rain will not distort the flight of the boomerang if you choose to use your boomerang on rainy days put a protective seal on it especially if it s made from wood to prevent it from swelling with moisture 8 x research source even though falling snow will not affect the flight of the boomerang snow on the ground will conceal a fallen boomerang making it almost impossible to find 9 x research source throw the boomerang around the wind you want to throw the boomerang around the wind meaning that you throw it to the right of an oncoming wind and it returns on the left or the opposite if you re left handed you want to throw your boomerang between 45 to 90 degrees to the right or left of an oncoming wind 10 x research source to figure out wind direction pick up a fistful of grass or leave and throw them into the air if the leaves blow across your face to the right you will need to turn left and vice versa 11 x research source stand so that the wind is blowing directly into your face then turn about 45 degrees to the left or right depending on which is your dominant hand 12 x research source some boomerangs work better when thrown at a wider angle to the wind up to 90 degrees so experiment a little to find out which angle works best for you 13 x research source throw the boomerang vertically with the correct layover boomerangs should be thrown vertically overhand as if throwing a baseball so they will cartwheel end over end hold the boomerang so that it s almost perpendicular with the ground tilting it 5 to 20 degrees to the right if you re right handed or to the left if you re left handed 14 x research source the degree to which you tilt the boomerang is called the layover if using a wide layover you should throw the boomerang softly whereas more vertical layovers will require harder throws 15 x research source throwing a boomerang horizontally will prevent the boomerang from returning it will cause the boomerang to climb high into the air before dropping straight back to the ground and potentially breaking 16 x research source throw the boomerang at the appropriate elevation most boomerangs only need to be thrown at eye level with an elevation about 10 degrees above the ground a good trick is to pick a point slightly above the horizon such as some far away tree top and aim directly for it 17 x research source figure out the footwork a right handed thrower will need to pivot their right foot outwards lift their left leg so all the weight is on the right then step forwards onto the left foot as they throw in a move that s known as casting the foot out left handed people will do the exact opposite this helps to put more weight behind the throw increasing the distance the boomerang will travel 18 x research source give it some spin spinning the boomerang as you throw is perhaps the most important deciding factor in whether your boomerang returns to you or not you can give your boomerang spin by cocking your wrist backwards then snapping it forwards as you throw you shouldn t just release the boomerang it should be ripped from your grip by the force of the spin 19 x research source focus on technique not strength unless you re really focused on distance the strength of your throw is not the most important thing when it comes to throwing a boomerang once you have the hang of putting a good spin on your throw you can start to focus on power 20 x research source catch the boomerang the best way to catch a returning boomerang is to extend both arms wait until the boomerang reaches below shoulder level then clap your hands together to catch the boomerang between your palms known as the sandwich catch if you ve lost sight of your boomerang or it s coming at you too fast turn around hunker to the ground and cover your head with hands 21 x research source there are lots of trick catches you can try such as the under the leg catch the hand to foot catch and behind the back catch you may want to wear some padded fingerless gloves to protect your hands while attempting these trick catches 22 x research source purchase a high quality boomerang the type of boomerang you buy will have a significant impact on whether you will get it to come back to you or not boomerangs are made from regular pieces of wood or plastic so it takes some skilled workmanship to imbue such everyday materials with the aerodynamic qualities that make boomerangs so unique there are loads of boomerangs on the market but not all of them are true returning boomerangs so do your research before you buy beginners should choose a v shaped or a tri bladed boomerang pick one that is made from lightweight materials these boomerangs do not require a strong throw which allows beginners to focus more on technique they will usually travel between 10 to 25 meters 32 8 to 82 0 ft before returning 23 x research source choose a heavier boomerang if you are advanced once you have mastered the throwing technique and your boomerang is consistently returning you can move on to intermediate and later advanced boomerangs these boomerangs tend to be heavier come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can travel distances of up to 50 meters 164 0 ft before returning 24 x research source pick a boomerang made for your dominant hand be aware that you will need either a left handed or right handed boomerang depending on your dominant hand if you re left handed you will have considerable difficulty in throwing a right handed boomerang with any success reassess your throw if your boomerang won t come back if your boomerang is failing to return to you the reason is one of two things your boomerang is of poor quality or your throw is incorrect if you think your throw is incorrect focus on correcting the following common mistakes 25 x research source decrease the layover of your throw if your throw is too horizontal it will almost certainly fail to come back throw your boomerang almost vertically for best results don t throw the boomerang across your body instead throw it straight ahead if your throwing hand ends up across from the opposite shoulder you know you re doing it incorrectly work on your spin focus on flicking your wrist as this is where most of the spin comes from you can also experiment with different grips and hand positioning to find out which is most comfortable and effective for you change your direction if your boomerang returns to the wrong spot if the boomerang comes back but lands too far in front of you or too far behind you to catch you are probably facing the wrong direction in relation to the wind 26 x research source if the boomerang lands in front of you try turning a few degrees to the left so you are throwing more directly into the wind if the boomerang lands behind you try turning a few degrees to the right so you are throwing further away from the wind these directions will be reversed if you are left handed watch your boomerang closely if you keep losing sight of it the flight of a boomerang is almost impossible to predict so if you look away for even a second you may not be able to find it again if you ve thrown it well the boomerang may fly back suddenly and hit you in the face but if you ve thrown it badly you may never be able to find it again 27 x research source wear sunglasses while practicing in case your boomerang flies into the path of the sun they will also protect your eyes should your boomerang come back and hit you in the face if the boomerang falls out of the sky as the result of a bad throw make a mental note of a landmark you can use to locate it search for it right away as you may not be able to find it later repair your boomerang if it becomes warped or nicked boomerangs can easily become warped or dented due to repeated crash landings or fumbled catches however with a little love and care most of these problems can be patched up and your boomerang will still be in perfect working order 28 x research source to fix a warped boomerang place the boomerang in the microwave or hold it over the heat on an electric stove for 8 10 seconds bend the boomerang in the opposite direction to the warp and hold it in place until the wood cools again 29 x research source to fix nicks and scratches fill any holes with a little wood putty once the putty dries sand the boomerang until smooth then cover with a coat of polyurethane seal to keep moisture out

how to build a slackline,for many people slacklining is a sport a hobby and more it s like tightrope walking at a safe distance from the ground and requires very little setup in fact you can build your own slackline at home with ordinary climbing gear you will need to anchor the line to a couple of trees or posts to create a bouncy tensioned line to walk once you have your supplies you can set up a line within minutes,choose thick tubular webbing for the slackline and slings slacklines are typically made from nylon cords 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm wide you will need a long piece for the slackline and 3 smaller slings to anchor the line for the main line 50 ft 15 m is a good length for beginners get shorter lines 10 to 15 ft 3 0 to 4 6 m long 1 x research source the cords along with other components are available online and at outdoor activity supply stores get the webbing and other supplies you need in one go by purchasing a slackline kit online stores and outdoor activity suppliers sell them you can make a slackline out of other material including car tow lines or bungee cords purchase line lockers and carabiners to connect the webbing pick up 2 line lockers and 5 carabiners to set up your line the line lockers are metal rings that prevent the slackline from coming undone make sure the carabiners are oval shaped and climbing strength to ensure they support your weight on the line 2 x research source you can also use metal rings from the hardware store or rappel rings from an outdoor activity supply store select strong anchor points to tie the slackline to find 2 trees posts concrete walls or other solid objects measure the distance between them to make sure your slackline is long enough shorter spans are easier to learn on and allow you to keep the line closer to the ground 3 x research source for a 50 ft 15 m line look for anchor points about 20 to 30 ft 6 1 to 9 1 m apart the distance between the anchors has to be about 20 ft 6 1 m shorter than your slackline so you can tie the line around them make sure the anchors are capable of sustaining 500 to 1 000 lb 230 to 450 kg of force if the anchors feels loose in the ground don t use them fragile surfaces like wood walls aren t safe anchor points if you don t have anchor points available you will need to make some build your own a frames or purchase them in a kit cut wood boards to create the a frame components you will need approximately 4 2 in 4 in 5 1 cm 10 2 cm planks about 8 ft 2 4 m long this will be enough to create 2 a frame use a miter saw set at a 22 5 degree angle wear safety goggles ear muffs and a dust mask if you cut the boards yourself you can also rent a saw at a home improvement store or have store employees cut the following boards 4 x research source 2 planks 18 in 46 cm long 2 planks 20 3 4 in 53 cm long 4 planks 36 in 91 cm long 2 planks 37 7 8 in 96 cm long arrange the boards in an a shape on a workbench set the boards out on a flat surface so you can fasten them together work on 1 a frame at a time to create the frame place the 2 medium boards on the sides fit the remaining boards between these medium boards place 1 of the long boards at the bottom then fit the shorter boards at the top and in the middle 5 x research source each a frame uses 5 boards when you re done the boards will create the shape of an a make sure all of the boards fit snugly together clamp the boards and drill pilot holes through them countersinking pilot holes prevents the boards from cracking and weakening use a drill with a 3 4 in 1 9 cm countersink bit to drill a pair of holes in each of the middle boards measure about 2 in 5 1 cm from the ends of each board then drill the holes diagonally into the side boards 6 x research source work from the bottom edges of lower support boards in the middle of the a frame for the small board at the top drill through the side boards to reach it use a pair of wood clamps to hold the boards in place as you work bolt the boards together with 2 1 2 in 6 4 cm decking screws place a screw in each of the pilot holes the screws will pass through the support planks and into the frame planks on the side make sure the boards fit together well and feel sturdy when you try to move them that way they won t fall apart when you re walking on your slackline 7 x research source cut plywood to fit over the a frame the plywood creates a spot for you to attach the slackline and anchor lines you will need a 8 in 20 cm sheet of plywood 1 2 in 1 3 cm thick for each a frame you wish to make set the a frame on top of the plywood then trace its outline with a pencil cut the outline using a reciprocating saw 8 x research source you can also use a jigsaw or circular saw to cut the plywood to avoid cutting the plywood too short leave it a little longer than the outline you can always cut it down further or sand it but you can t fix it once it s too small for the a frame fasten the plywood to the a frame with 2 in 5 1 cm decking screws place the plywood over the a frame place a screw about every 12 in 30 cm along each of the boards in the frame screw through the plywood and into the frame boards to secure everything together 9 x research source the frame boards are a little difficult to find underneath the plywood feel for the solid boards through the plywood if you re unsure lift up the plywood to locate them outline them with a pencil to help you place the screws drill a pair of holes through the plywood to create anchor points use a 1 1 2 in 3 8 cm drill bit to make the holes position them underneath the top board on the a frame make the holes about 2 in 5 1 cm apart use a reciprocating saw or another tool to remove the wood between the holes 10 x research source basically you create a slot in the a frame to thread the slackline webbing through tie the a frames to anchor points using nylon webbing find an anchor point for each a frame one way to do this is by planting metal stakes or struts firmly in the ground use extra line lockers and carabiners to run the webbing from the stakes to the slot in the a frame make sure the stakes are well planted so the frames can t move when you touch them 11 x research source another way to plant the a frames is by burying concrete cinder blocks in your yard tie a chain around each cinder blocks then run the chains to the a frames to preserve the webbing for longer sand your a frames smooth before using them secure a sling to the first anchor point at waist height position the loop of webbing about 2 to 3 ft 0 61 to 0 91 m off the ground for a 15 to 20 ft 4 6 to 6 1 m slackline loop the webbing tightly around the tree then connect the ends with a carabiner 12 x research source before using trees for anchors cover the bark with padding like a towel or carpeting if you re creating a longer slackline you may need to raise the slings up further to keep the line off the ground if the line touches the ground when you climb onto it take it apart and raise the webbing hook the slackline to the sling with a carabiner fold the first 12 in 30 cm of the line over on itself to create a small loop push the loop through a line locker to keep the slackline secure later then pull about 5 in 13 cm of the line back around and through the line locker again to create a double loop clip a single carabiner to it 13 x research source pull on the line to make sure the sling feels secure in the loop if it feels loose take it out of the line locker and carabiner then knot it again place a line locker and carabiner about 80 of the way from the second anchor lay the slackline out on the ground between the anchor points walk towards the loose end of the line and the second anchor point estimate when 80 of the line is behind you then pull the line through a line locker tie the end of the line to a carabiner using a double loop like you did earlier 14 x research source you can usually get a good estimate of where to place the line locker by looking at the line as you walk if you need to measure it out with a ruler or tape measure for example if you re using a 20 ft 6 1 m line place the line locker 15 to 16 ft 4 6 to 4 9 m along the slackline wrap 2 slings with carabiners around the far anchor point place the slings on the anchor point closest to the free end of the slackline keep the slings close together connect the ends of each sling with a single carabiner lay the carabiners on top of one another positioning them so the gate parts that open face in opposite directions 15 x research source remember to protect trees by placing padding underneath the slings test the slings when you re done to make sure they are knotted tightly in place loop the slackline around the carabiners to anchor it in place bring the slackline underneath and through the lower carabiner on your anchor point then pull the line back towards you and through the carabiner with the line locker pass the line under and through the upper carabiner on the anchor point finally pull the line underneath and back through the carabiner with the line locker 16 x research source this is called a primitive 4 carabiner pulley system it can be a little tricky to get at first but it s a safe fun way to create a slackline without any extra tools or knots if you have a ratchet system attach the ratchet to an anchor point then feed the slackline webbing through it 17 x research source pull the line toward the far anchor to tighten it grab onto the tail end of the slackline and pull it towards the first anchor with the single carabiner get the line moderately taught enough to keep it from sagging tighter lines are better for bouncing and doing tricks adjust the line to get the amount of tension you desire 18 x research source if you re using a ratchet pull the ratchet handle down to tighten the line don t tighten it too much keep at least a little slack in the line to prevent it from snapping you may need help pulling a line over 30 ft 9 1 m have a friend help you pull the line another way to pull a long line is by installing a pulley system hook the pulley to the anchor point run a cord from the locking anchor in the line to the pulley then tug the webbing through the pulley to tighten it 19 x research source test the line by sitting or bouncing on it climb onto the line walk across it or bounce on it a little bit to stretch out the anchors and knots make sure the line feels secure but doesn t touch the ground when you walk the middle of it 20 x research source if the line needs adjustment tug on the end of the slackline to tighten or loosen it if you need to raise the line loosen it first before untying the webbing around the anchors release the line by pulling it in the opposite direction pull the tail end of the line away from the anchor point to undo it this is very safe and easy to do in a primitive pulley system once you have lowered the line removing all tension from it unhook the carabiners to take down all of the webbing 21 x research source if you re using a ratchet unlock the ratchet to release the tension pull the slackline out of the ratchet to take it down,Sports-and-Fitness
how to sandboard,sandboarding is a great option when the surf s poor the snow s gone or the skateboarding areas are crowded this activity combines elements of snowboarding surfing and skating allowing you to board on sand dunes instead of snow or water to sandboard start by getting the proper board and protective gear then find sand dunes nearby and do a first run you can also try stopping and turning on a sandboard with enough practice you ll be boarding down the dunes with ease in no time,rent a sandboard at a facility close to a sand dune many areas with sand dunes offer a rental service where you can rent a sandboard for a small fee usually around 15 25 usd check if there is a rental area in spots near you with sand dunes or in areas you are planning to visit 1 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source renting a sandboard may be a good option if you do not want to have to buy a sandboard right away repurpose a snowboard or surfboard you don t plan on using again in a pinch you can use a snowboard or surfboard you already own to try sandboarding a snowboard with a square or twin tail is ideal a smaller surfboard sometimes called a boogie board is good for sandboarding as it will not be too long make sure the snowboard or surfboard is smooth on both sides so it will glide well on the sand buy a sandboard at a local surf shop or online sandboards are usually made of wood metal or plastic they should be about 9 to 12 millimetres 0 35 to 0 47 in thick 140 to 160 centimetres 55 to 63 in wide and 100 to 120 centimetres 39 to 47 in long get a longer or shorter board based on your size and height look for a board with a square or twin tail so it glides nicely on the sand 2 x research source sandboards can be pricy ranging from 150 200 usd get a sandboard with bindings if you plan to board standing up bindings are straps that are attached to the board and are designed to hold your feet in place when you are on the board if you prefer to glide down the dunes on your stomach you do not need a board with bindings most surf shops and some snowboard shops will offer sandboards talk to a sale representative in the store to find the right board for you wear a helmet and protective gear you can go fairly fast on a sandboard especially if you find a good dune that slopes downhill make sure you always wear a helmet and elbow pads to protect your head and arms you can also wear knee pads if you are riding the sandboard standing up 3 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source you should also wear sunscreen with at least 15 spf sunglasses preferably with anti glare and long sleeves to protect yourself from the sun when you are out on the dunes visit a national park with unprotected sand dunes many national parks in desert areas or areas with a dry climate will have sand dunes sand dunes that are protected or off limits to the public will not be an option you may need to travel to a specific national park that is known for its sand dunes to try sandboarding 4 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source check online on national park websites to see if they have sand dunes you can access for sandboarding contact sandboarding companies to ask them where you can sandboard in your area go to a desert or a beach with sand dunes if you live close to a desert find out if it has sand dunes that you are allowed to board on some beaches in warm climates will also have natural sand dunes you can use to try sandboarding contact your local government land agency or department to find out if you can access a nearby desert or beach for sandboarding some tourist companies will offer desert or beach tours that include trying sandboarding on sand dunes sign up for a tour so you can try this fun activity in a safe monitored environment head out to the sand dunes early in the morning to avoid the heat aim to be out on the dunes by 8 9 am so you can enjoy a few hours of sandboarding before the day heats up going to the sand dunes early can also help you avoid sandstorms and bad weather that tends to hit in the mid afternoon in desert areas 5 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source in the spring it can get pretty windy in the afternoons around sand dunes avoid going out in the afternoons in the spring if you want to have a few good runs on the sandboard wax the bottom of the sandboard use a small amount of sandboard wax on the bottom of the board rub the wax across the board from the back to the top and a small amount of the edges of the board take a handful of dry sand and rub it over the wax to help smooth it out apply sand to the board until it no longer sticks on the wax 6 x research source slide the board back and forth in the sand bottom down so the board glides easily in the sand do not use wet sand on the board as this can cause your board to stick to the sand as you ride lie down on your belly for a less strenuous run make sure you are facing in the direction you are heading down the dune keep your arms and legs tucked into the center of the board you will need to use a sandboard with no bindings to be able to lie down on your belly comfortably stand with your feet in the bindings for a more challenging run sit down and strap your feet into the bindings make sure your dominant foot is in front of the board pointing in the direction you are heading down the dune 7 x research source you should be able to rock back on your heels when you are strapped into the bindings start on a small dune with a flat starting point look for a dune with dry sand that has a 4 to 5 m 13 to 16 ft slope make sure there are no shrubs sticks shells or obstructions around the dune or at the bottom of the dune 8 x research source place your board downhill if you are standing on the board keep your weight centered and your knees slightly bent shift your weight forward and keep your hips and shoulders stacked on top of each other turn your head in the direction you are heading and keep your arms relaxed at your sides 9 x research source if you are lying on your belly keep your body in the center of the board with your legs tucked in and your chin up push off the dune to gain speed if you are standing tip your weight slightly forward and slide the board until it moves down the dune if you are lying on your belly use your hands to push yourself off the dune keep your weight centered as you ride down the dune if you are standing allow the board to pick up speed as you ride down the dune keeping your back leg strong and your weight in the center of the board if you are lying on your belly keep your arms and legs tucked in and your chin up as you slide down the dune avoid leaning forward or shifting your weight too far forward as you ride 10 x research source stretch your hands out to help you balance as you ride you should slow down as you reach the bottom of the dune and come to a gradual stop run back up the dune with your board to do a second run there are usually no lifts to carry you back up to the dunes so you will have to run back up the dune on your own do another run on the same hill to get the hang of sandboarding then challenge yourself to do a bigger dune or a dune with a bigger slope you may need to wax your board again between runs to keep it smooth and help it to slide on the sand practice slide stops you will need to be standing upright on the board to try stopping and turning techniques start by finding a small dune with a slight slope place the board facing downhill put your weight in your heels and keep your toes up then drop your toes down so the board lies flat and you slide slowly down the hill lift your toes and dig your heels in to stop 11 x research source you can also try this facing uphill repeat the same steps lowering your heels down to slide backwards and then raising them up to slow down to a stop try doing a full stop at the bottom of a dune once you have mastered slide stops you can try doing a full stop once you ride down a dune pick a dune that ends in a flat straight line as you come to the flat sand at the bottom of the dune shift your weight to your front foot and slide your back leg outward move your shoulders and hips frontward so you are facing towards the bottom of the dune raise your toes and slide your back foot out until you come to a stop on the edge of your board 12 x research source keep your weight even on both feet so you slide smoothly to a stop practice turning on a small dune begin by riding straight down a dune then shift your weight forward and lift your back heel rotate your hips of where you would like to turn and let your body lean into the turn keep your hips and legs centered on the board as you lean make sure you give yourself time to turn as it may not be a slow turn if you are in deep sand or sand that is slightly wet practice turning in different directions by lifting your back heel and rotating your hips while you are on the board it may take some practice to be able to turn at faster speeds or as you come down steeper dunes,Sports-and-Fitness
how to ride a mechanical bull,the use of mechanical bulls was originally intended for bull riders in training but now they ve become a popular activity at parties and western bars across the country if you want to impress people with your bull riding skills you ll need to master mounting the bull assuming the correct positioning and balancing so you can stay on as long as possible follow these steps to master bull riding and maybe even win a prize in a bull riding contest,jump up and bring 1 leg over the bull to sit in the saddle most mechanical bulls are surrounded by bouncy padded flooring use this padding to hop up and get your right or left leg over the bull then use your hands and arms to steady yourself on top your legs should hang down on each side of the bull s back 1 x research source some people might have trouble initially mounting the bull because it is too high this is why you should use the padded flooring to your advantage try not to jump too high because you might miss and jump over the bull completely hold on to the rope palm up with your non dominant hand mechanical bulls will either have a padded strap or a long rope handle that you can hold on to use this after you jump up on the bull to stable yourself and adjust your positioning it is best to hold on to it underhanded with your non dominant hand 2 x research source holding on to the rope underhand allows for the best stability when the bull is in motion it also helps you to release your grip more easily when you fall move your body forward in the saddle and squeeze it with your thighs it s best to position your body as far forward on the saddle as you can this will help to minimize your movement which will ultimately keep you on the bull longer once you are far up on the saddle squeeze the sides of the bull with your thighs so you are firmly rooted to the bull s body 3 x research source pull your legs forward position your legs forward and avoid angling them behind you when you re sitting on the bull if your feet are behind you it will be harder for you to balance while the bull is moving and you may fall forward on the bull if it moves down 4 x research source dig your heels into the bull s side once your legs are positioned correctly dig your heels into the sides of the bull and point your toes outward this will allow you to get a better grip on the bull with your feet 5 x research source don t use your toes to try to hold on to the bull they do not have enough strength to keep a good grip relax your upper body in order for your bull ride to last a long time you ll need to make sure your entire upper body is relaxed if you re too stiff the momentum will swing you off the bull and you ll fall over quickly a relaxed body during a mechanical bull ride will resemble a flag waving in the wind your upper body should sway along with the bull s motions 6 x research source raise your dominant hand in the air for balance hold onto the rope with your non dominant hand and raise your dominant hand in the air to balance yourself to do this keep your arm in an l shape instead of holding it straight out or up in the air while the bull is in motion use your best judgment to move your arm around so that it keeps you in place 7 x research source keeping your dominant hand free is the best option to break your fall if you happen to lose your balance keep your eyes on the bull s head avoid the urge to look out into the crowd at your friends while you re riding the mechanical bull it is best to keep your eyes on the back of the bull s head the entire time this will help you to watch for directional changes and ultimately keep balance looking up will distract you and you ll have trouble adjusting your body when the bull changes directions 8 x research source move your upper body in a seesaw motion when the bull is in motion its body will be moving up and down like a seesaw you ll need to mirror these movements with your body in order to stay on as long as possible when the bull s head goes down lean your upper body back so you don t fall forward when the bull s head goes up lean all the way forward so you don t fall back 9 x research source make sure you continue to keep your body loose while you re making these movements if your body is rigid you ll be thrown off pretty quickly always maintain a firm grip with your legs while you re moving forward and back with your upper body sway your upper body slightly right or left when the bull turns the mechanical bull will also be swaying left and right and spinning in circles you ll want to adjust your body to these movements as well if the bull goes left try to lean a bit right if the bull goes right then try leaning a bit left when the bull spins in circles try to lean in the opposite way to keep your balance 10 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play pickleball,pickleball is a fast paced game that combines elements of tennis badminton and ping pong it s an extremely popular paddleboard sport partly because it doesn t require much equipment and it s super easy to learn and play all you need are paddles a pickleball and a pickleball court whether you re playing singles or doubles learn the layout of the court and follow a few simple rules for an exciting back and forth competition,find a pickleball or badminton court to play a game pickleball and badminton courts have the same size measurements but a pickleball court will have the net lowered to the ground so it s at a height of 34 inches 86 cm search online for pickleball courts near you or find a gym that has badminton and pickleball courts that you can use to play a game 1 x research source pickleball courts can be located outside or indoors play with 2 people for singles or 4 people for doubles pickleball can be played with 2 people competing against each other which is known as singles play or with 2 teams of 2 people playing against each other which is called doubles play games of singles and doubles both use the same court have the same number of faults before losing their serve and are often played to 11 points 2 x research source doubles is the most popular way to play pickleball use 1 pickleball and have each player use a pickleball paddle pickleball specially designed paddles which are smaller than tennis racquets but larger than ping pong paddles each player needs to have 1 paddle you also need to use a pickleball which is a lightweight ball with holes through it like a whiffle ball 3 x research source there are a variety of colors you can choose for your pickleball stand behind the baseline of the right service court to start a game a serve which is the strike that starts a game or round of pickleball is always performed from behind the baseline which is the 20 ft 6 1 m line at the end of each side of the court when you re starting a game of pickleball stand behind the baseline on the right side of the court 4 x research source the 2 squares in front of the baseline are known as the right and left service courts once a game is in play you ll alternate which service court you stand behind to serve hit the pickleball with an underhand strike below waist level to serve it hold the pickleball at your side with 1 hand and hold your paddle steady with another when you re ready to serve drop the pickleball and strike it with an underhand motion with your paddle 5 x research source if you hit the pickleball above waist level or if the ball bounces off of the ground then it s a fault clear the net so the ball bounces once on the opposite service court aim for the service court diagonally across from you when you serve the pickleball so it bounces on it once avoid hitting the net with your serve or hitting the pickleball past the opposing team s baseline before it bounces off of the ground in the opposite service court 6 x research source for example if you re serving from behind your right service court you must bounce the ball once on the opposing team s right service court which is diagonal across from you if your serve hits the net or goes past the opposing team s sideline or baseline before it bounces on the service court then it s a fault switch to the other service court when you score a point when you serve the pickleball and it bounces off of the opposing team s service court the ball is in play and is hit back and forth until a fault is committed such as the ball going out of bounds hitting the net or bouncing more than once on the court if the opposing team commits a fault when it s your serve then you score a point whenever you score a point start your next serve from behind the other service court 7 x research source for instance if you serve the pickleball from behind the right service court and then the other team commits a fault and you score a point your next serve will be from behind the left service court only the team that is serving can score a point allow the other player or team to serve when you commit 2 faults if you re playing singles or 1 on 1 you get to commit 2 faults before you turn over the serve to the other player so they can have a chance to score if you re playing doubles or 2 on 2 whenever a player on a team commits a fault then their partner gets to serve whenever the team commits 2 faults then the other team gets to serve 8 x research source score a point when it s your serve and your opponent commits a fault after the ball is served and the 2 bounce rule is observed both teams volley the ball back and forth and keep it in play whenever a team commits a fault such as the ball going out of bounds or bouncing twice on the court then the play stops and the ball is served if it s your serve and the opposing team commits a fault then your team earns 1 point 9 x research source if it s your team s serve and you commit a fault then no points are awarded however if you commit 2 faults then it becomes the other team s serve wait until the serve bounces on the service court before returning it when the ball is served it must be allowed to bounce 1 time on the service court once the ball bounces on the service court use your paddle to return the ball to the other side of the net so it can bounce on 1 of the service courts 10 x research source the return ball can be bounced on either of the opposing team s service courts allow the return to bounce once on the court before you hit it back the two bounce rule requires both the serve and return ball to bounce 1 time on the service court before the ball is allowed to be volleyed back and forth after you send your serve and the opposing team returns it wait until the ball bounces on the service court and then hit it back over the net with your paddle 11 x research source if the return ball doesn t land on one of the service courts to bounce then it s a fault and the serving team scores a point hit the ball before or after it bounces once the two bounce rule is followed once the two bounce rule has been observed volley the ball back and forth by hitting it either before it touches the ground or after 1 bounce keep the ball in bounds and avoid hitting the net as you hit it to the other side 12 x research source you can t hit the ball more than once or pass it off to a teammate if the ball bounces on sideline or baseline then it s still in play if the ball hits outside of the lines then it s out of bounds which is a fault avoid standing in the kitchen when you re volleying the ball the kitchen also called the non volley zone is the small rectangular zone in front of each side of the net you can t volley the ball if you re standing in the zone or if your foot is on the line or it s a fault before you volley the ball back to the other team make sure you aren t in the kitchen 13 x research source it s also a fault if a serve lands in the kitchen continue volleying the ball until a fault is committed keep the ball in play and hit it back and forth to the opposing team there is no limit to the number of volleys you can perform if it s your serve and the opposing team commits a fault then your team scores a point and the ball is served again if you commit a fault while it s your serve then you get to serve the ball again and no points are scored if you commit 2 faults while it s your serve then the opposing team gets to serve 14 x research source games of pickleball are often played to 11 points with 1 team needing to be ahead by 2 points in order to win however tournament games can go to 15 or 21 with a team needing to be ahead by 2 points in order to win score 11 points to be eligible to win a game as you play a game keep track of the points that are scored by each team once a team reaches 11 points they re eligible to win the game if they already have a 2 point lead whenever they reach 11 points then they win the game 15 x research source for instance if the score of a game is 10 to 4 and the team with 10 points scores again then they win the game earn a 2 point lead once you have 11 points to win once a team scores 11 points if they have a 2 point lead then the game is over and they win but if a team scores 11 points and they don t have a 2 point lead then the game continues until they do 16 x research source for example if you score 11 points but the opposing team has 10 points then you must score another point to make the score 12 to 10 in order to win the game play 3 total games to decide the winner of a match pickleball is fast paced and points are scored often so matches of pickleball usually consist of 3 total games win 2 out of 3 games in order to win a match 17 x research source some pickleball tournaments may have matches of 5 games,Sports-and-Fitness
how to throw a boomerang,a boomerang is a type of throwing star which originated in australia as a hunting weapon used by the aboriginal people nowadays the boomerang is used for sport and recreation and is famous for its unique ability to return to the thrower throwing a returning boomerang is a skill which requires a specific technique and plenty of practice making it a feat akin to getting a hole in one on the golf course,start with the proper grip you can hold the boomerang on either arm the lift leading arm or the dingle trailing arm either way make sure that the painted curved side is always facing toward you and the flat side is facing away from you 1 x research source try the pinch grip the pinch grip involves pinching the boomerang between your thumb and index finger you throw the boomerang by flicking your wrist backwards before snapping it forwards this creates enough momentum to pull the boomerang out of your hand and create spin 2 x research source test the cradle grip this grip is similar to the pinch grip except you wrap your index finger or all four fingers around the edge of the boomerang instead grip the boomerang as close to the bottom of the arm as possible and as you throw flick the boomerang with your index finger as if pulling a trigger this helps to create spin 3 x research source find a large open area choose an area where you have at least 50 meters 164 0 ft of space on all sides football fields soccer pitches and open park spaces are all good options make sure there are not too many trees or bushes for your boomerang to get caught in or large bodies of water for it to fall into 4 x research source avoid practicing your boomerang throw in crowded areas or places with a lot of windows or parked cars it can be difficult to predict where your boomerang will land and a mis thrown boomerang can cause significant injury or damage to property 5 x research source you should always throw from the center of an open space this will help you to throw more consistently while also providing some leeway on all sides if the flight of the boomerang doesn t go as planned 6 x research source watch out for weather conditions wind is one of the most important factors in the proper return of a boomerang ideally you want a nice calm day with winds between 0 to 10 mph 16 km h some boomerangs will not return in completely calm weather but most will avoid throwing your boomerang in high winds as it will distort the path of the boomerang and throw it off course 7 x research source light rain will not distort the flight of the boomerang if you choose to use your boomerang on rainy days put a protective seal on it especially if it s made from wood to prevent it from swelling with moisture 8 x research source even though falling snow will not affect the flight of the boomerang snow on the ground will conceal a fallen boomerang making it almost impossible to find 9 x research source throw the boomerang around the wind you want to throw the boomerang around the wind meaning that you throw it to the right of an oncoming wind and it returns on the left or the opposite if you re left handed you want to throw your boomerang between 45 to 90 degrees to the right or left of an oncoming wind 10 x research source to figure out wind direction pick up a fistful of grass or leave and throw them into the air if the leaves blow across your face to the right you will need to turn left and vice versa 11 x research source stand so that the wind is blowing directly into your face then turn about 45 degrees to the left or right depending on which is your dominant hand 12 x research source some boomerangs work better when thrown at a wider angle to the wind up to 90 degrees so experiment a little to find out which angle works best for you 13 x research source throw the boomerang vertically with the correct layover boomerangs should be thrown vertically overhand as if throwing a baseball so they will cartwheel end over end hold the boomerang so that it s almost perpendicular with the ground tilting it 5 to 20 degrees to the right if you re right handed or to the left if you re left handed 14 x research source the degree to which you tilt the boomerang is called the layover if using a wide layover you should throw the boomerang softly whereas more vertical layovers will require harder throws 15 x research source throwing a boomerang horizontally will prevent the boomerang from returning it will cause the boomerang to climb high into the air before dropping straight back to the ground and potentially breaking 16 x research source throw the boomerang at the appropriate elevation most boomerangs only need to be thrown at eye level with an elevation about 10 degrees above the ground a good trick is to pick a point slightly above the horizon such as some far away tree top and aim directly for it 17 x research source figure out the footwork a right handed thrower will need to pivot their right foot outwards lift their left leg so all the weight is on the right then step forwards onto the left foot as they throw in a move that s known as casting the foot out left handed people will do the exact opposite this helps to put more weight behind the throw increasing the distance the boomerang will travel 18 x research source give it some spin spinning the boomerang as you throw is perhaps the most important deciding factor in whether your boomerang returns to you or not you can give your boomerang spin by cocking your wrist backwards then snapping it forwards as you throw you shouldn t just release the boomerang it should be ripped from your grip by the force of the spin 19 x research source focus on technique not strength unless you re really focused on distance the strength of your throw is not the most important thing when it comes to throwing a boomerang once you have the hang of putting a good spin on your throw you can start to focus on power 20 x research source catch the boomerang the best way to catch a returning boomerang is to extend both arms wait until the boomerang reaches below shoulder level then clap your hands together to catch the boomerang between your palms known as the sandwich catch if you ve lost sight of your boomerang or it s coming at you too fast turn around hunker to the ground and cover your head with hands 21 x research source there are lots of trick catches you can try such as the under the leg catch the hand to foot catch and behind the back catch you may want to wear some padded fingerless gloves to protect your hands while attempting these trick catches 22 x research source purchase a high quality boomerang the type of boomerang you buy will have a significant impact on whether you will get it to come back to you or not boomerangs are made from regular pieces of wood or plastic so it takes some skilled workmanship to imbue such everyday materials with the aerodynamic qualities that make boomerangs so unique there are loads of boomerangs on the market but not all of them are true returning boomerangs so do your research before you buy beginners should choose a v shaped or a tri bladed boomerang pick one that is made from lightweight materials these boomerangs do not require a strong throw which allows beginners to focus more on technique they will usually travel between 10 to 25 meters 32 8 to 82 0 ft before returning 23 x research source choose a heavier boomerang if you are advanced once you have mastered the throwing technique and your boomerang is consistently returning you can move on to intermediate and later advanced boomerangs these boomerangs tend to be heavier come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can travel distances of up to 50 meters 164 0 ft before returning 24 x research source pick a boomerang made for your dominant hand be aware that you will need either a left handed or right handed boomerang depending on your dominant hand if you re left handed you will have considerable difficulty in throwing a right handed boomerang with any success reassess your throw if your boomerang won t come back if your boomerang is failing to return to you the reason is one of two things your boomerang is of poor quality or your throw is incorrect if you think your throw is incorrect focus on correcting the following common mistakes 25 x research source decrease the layover of your throw if your throw is too horizontal it will almost certainly fail to come back throw your boomerang almost vertically for best results don t throw the boomerang across your body instead throw it straight ahead if your throwing hand ends up across from the opposite shoulder you know you re doing it incorrectly work on your spin focus on flicking your wrist as this is where most of the spin comes from you can also experiment with different grips and hand positioning to find out which is most comfortable and effective for you change your direction if your boomerang returns to the wrong spot if the boomerang comes back but lands too far in front of you or too far behind you to catch you are probably facing the wrong direction in relation to the wind 26 x research source if the boomerang lands in front of you try turning a few degrees to the left so you are throwing more directly into the wind if the boomerang lands behind you try turning a few degrees to the right so you are throwing further away from the wind these directions will be reversed if you are left handed watch your boomerang closely if you keep losing sight of it the flight of a boomerang is almost impossible to predict so if you look away for even a second you may not be able to find it again if you ve thrown it well the boomerang may fly back suddenly and hit you in the face but if you ve thrown it badly you may never be able to find it again 27 x research source wear sunglasses while practicing in case your boomerang flies into the path of the sun they will also protect your eyes should your boomerang come back and hit you in the face if the boomerang falls out of the sky as the result of a bad throw make a mental note of a landmark you can use to locate it search for it right away as you may not be able to find it later repair your boomerang if it becomes warped or nicked boomerangs can easily become warped or dented due to repeated crash landings or fumbled catches however with a little love and care most of these problems can be patched up and your boomerang will still be in perfect working order 28 x research source to fix a warped boomerang place the boomerang in the microwave or hold it over the heat on an electric stove for 8 10 seconds bend the boomerang in the opposite direction to the warp and hold it in place until the wood cools again 29 x research source to fix nicks and scratches fill any holes with a little wood putty once the putty dries sand the boomerang until smooth then cover with a coat of polyurethane seal to keep moisture out

how to tie a lasso,a cowboy never leaves home without his trusty lasso whether you re likely to actually need one or just indulging a wild west fantasy knowing how to tie a lasso on the double can help you rope the wildest mustang on the range or grab a pesky cattle rustler before he makes his getaway luckily all it takes is one simple knot to get started,grab a length of rope for a lasso the exact length of rope you use isn t important provided you have enough length to tie your knot form the loop and twirl it above your head any extra length can be coiled up and carried with you for adults about 30 feet 9 1 m of rope is plenty for children shorter may be better 1 x research source if you re just practicing nearly any type of rope will suffice however if you intend to actually use your lasso you ll want a thin tough somewhat stiff rope stiffness makes the rope a little harder to tie however it s a desirable quality because it allows you to push the rope to make adjustments to the size of your loop tie a loose overhand knot the first step in tying a lasso is to make a simple overhand knot an overhand knot is the basic type of knot you re probably familiar with from everyday life to make one just create a loop in your rope then pass one end of the rope through the loop don t tighten this knot keep it loose and give yourself lots of slack to work with you ll be modifying this basic knot in the next few steps when done correctly your rope should now look like a large o with the loose knot at the bottom 2 x research source pass the tail end of the rope back through the knot take the shorter tail end of the rope in your hand pull this end of the rope around and over your o loop thread this length of rope between the outside of the o portion of the overhand knot and itself pull the rope about 6 inches 15 2 cm through this will form a new loop which will become the base of your lasso 3 x research source carefully tighten your knot without pulling the tail end through pull on the slack end of the rope the part you ll hold onto when you throw your lasso and the new loop you just made as you do this be careful not to pull the tail end of the rope back through the knot when finished you should have a tight knot at the base of a small loop with the tail end of your knot extending from the knot as well this is called a honda knot pass the slack end of your rope through the honda knot finally simply pass the long slack end of your rope through the small loop in your honda knot to create a functional lasso by pulling on the slack end of the rope you can tighten the lasso to grab onto objects tie a stopper knot optional if you re just making a lasso for fun or for display purposes you re finished however if you intend to actually use it you may want to tie just one more knot to make your lasso more durable and easy to use in its current state the short tail end of your lasso can be pulled back through the honda knot causing your knot to come undone and ruining your lasso to prevent this simply tie a tight stopper knot at the end of the tail a basic overhand knot will do hold your lasso if you simply grab onto the slack end of your rope and start to swing the tension in the rope will pull the loop in your lasso shut before you can throw it so it s important to use a grip that keeps your lasso wide open as you twirl it and build momentum hold your lasso as directed below 4 x research source make a nice big loop by feeding slack through your honda knot lay a foot or two of the leftover slack rope next to your loop grab the loop and the length of slack rope together this should create a doubled up length of rope between the honda knot and your hand this doubled up portion is called the shank point your index finger down the shank towards the honda knot for added control twirl your wrist around over your head with the rope holding the rope at the end of the shank begin to swing it in a circle above your head be careful not to hit your head or to catch yourself by the neck swing fast enough that it s not difficult to keep the loop roughly horizontal but not so fast that you struggle to control it 5 x research source release the rope as you feel its momentum swing forward throwing a lasso isn t the same as throwing a baseball it s more a matter of releasing the lasso at the right time than of propelling it forward try to let go of the lasso as you feel its weight swing forward this isn t necessarily when the loop itself is in front of you rather it s most likely when the loop is directly to your side when you throw the lasso let go of the loop itself but keep control of the rope so that you can tighten your lasso tighten the lasso to grab your target once it s around whatever you re trying to lasso pull hard on the rope this will pull the slack in the loop through the honda knot tightening the lasso around whatever object is inside it never use a lasso on people or animals unless you re an experienced roper unsafe lasso use can cause suffocation or damage to the throat it s also difficult or impossible for someone or something to remove a lasso without help so don t run this risk unless you know what you re doing,Sports-and-Fitness
how to improve your aim,in most competitive sports and games accuracy is just as important as any other skill when it comes to aiming in video games your settings and equipment matter a great deal if you re aiming a ball or throwing something your throwing mechanics and form are key to helping you hit your target regardless of where you re trying to improve your aim practice will always help you improve so be sure to spend plenty of time practicing your accuracy,track your target with the reticle while you move in the game when you re moving in game move the reticle which is your crosshairs so that you re always looking at the thing you re aiming at regardless of the direction you re moving even if there isn t an opponent or enemy in front of you keep the reticle aimed at corners and doorways where the enemy may appear if an enemy is in front of you keep the reticle on them even if you aren t firing yet 1 x research source different games have different projectile speeds depending on the game you may want to aim a little in front of your opponent if they re moving laterally if you re using a weapon with a scope function don t turn it on until right before you plan on shooting if you keep the scope on you re obscuring your field of vision for no benefit use flick shots to develop accurate reflexes and fire at moving targets flick shooting is a common technique for snipers and players with non automatic weapons it involves holding the reticle in a neutral position on the horizon and moving quickly to your target once they appear in your field of vision after you let a shot off immediately move the cursor back to the same neutral position this will train your vision and reflexes to let off accurate shots quickly when you ll only get one or two shots 2 x research source this is a good general strategy if you re camping keep your neutral position on the spawn point doorway or corner you re covering and move it quickly as targets enter the area it s hard to get used to this expect this to be kind of difficult to do for your first couple of matches if you re using an automatic weapon shotgun or you re playing a more aggressive style this is likely not the best way to aim this is the best way to aim skillshots in mobas and rpgs as well crouch when firing to control your reticle and keep it from moving in most modern games kickback is greatly reduced when you shoot from a crouched position if this is true in your game always hit the crouch button right before you plan to let off a few shots 3 x research source if you aren t sure whether crouching improves your accuracy or not watch the size of the reticle when you crouch if the reticle gets smaller when you re crouching it s helping with the accuracy crouching may be a good idea even if it doesn t reduce kickback in a 1 on 1 fight crouching makes you harder to hit use single or burst shots instead of holding down the trigger in most games the longer you hold the trigger down the wider your field of fire becomes this dramatically lowers your accuracy to avoid this pull the trigger once every 1 2 seconds or let off a series of fast individual shots instead of holding the trigger down this will dramatically improve your accuracy 4 x research source in some games there is a setting where you can change the shooting mode for certain guns practice your aim with aim trainers or reflex games aim trainers are simple online games that help you practice your reflexes and aiming there are hundreds of aim trainers online so just pick one for the game that you play alternatively you can play reflex games like osu beat aim or audiosurf to improve your aiming skills 5 x research source playing an aim trainer or reflex game for 15 20 minutes a day is a great way to improve over time lower the sensitivity if you re using a game controller if you re playing a game on a console go into the game s settings lower the in game x and y axis sensitivity so that your joysticks are slower than they normally are this will make it easier to control your movement and aiming in your game 6 x research source many players assume that a higher sensitivity is better for aiming it s not when the sensitivity is high any minor mistake can throw your aim off if it s lower you give yourself a wider margin of error it s also a lot harder to get disoriented when your motions are slower as a console player you can still benefit from the in game aiming techniques here but don t worry about the mouse settings dpi or technical tips if you re interested in competitive gaming or really improving your aim switch to a mouse and keyboard controllers are much harder to use accurately than a mouse and keyboard buy a lightweight wired mouse with a high dpi for pc gaming the lighter your mouse is the easier it will be to move stay away from wireless mice since they tend to have a minor delay when considering a mouse purchase a mouse with a dpi of 1 000 or higher dpi stands for dots per inch and it refers to how many pixels a cursor covers when you move the mouse 7 x research source a high dpi isn t always better for aiming but a high dpi combined with a low in game sensitivity is a recipe for success some mice have variable dpis that you can change by pressing a button on the mouse these are a great option if you want more control over the settings the cheap throwaway mice you can buy for 5 10 at an office supply store often have a dpi between 400 600 a high end gaming mouse on the other hand may have up to 16 000 dpi most people don t need a dpi this high so as long as it s higher than 1 000 you should be fine mousepads are all more or less the same in terms of function but the size is pretty important get the biggest mousepad that will fit on your desk to give yourself plenty of room to move 8 x research source change your in game sensitivity based on your mouse s dpi when you open a game go into the settings panel and lower the aim sensitivity the higher your dpi is the lower you ll want to set the sensitivity while this is largely a matter of personal preference toy around with the sensitivity settings until your cursor moves a little slower than you d normally set it 9 x research source in most games with 1600 dpi you ll want the sensitivity set to 10 30 so long as you can turn 180 degrees when moving the mousepad from one edge of the mousepad to another you re fine use your glove and shoulders to square up throws in baseball turn your feet to line up with your target as you take the ball out of your glove point the glove towards your target focus your eyes on where you want to throw the ball as you turn your torso to throw the ball pull the glove up to your chest and stop rotating your shoulders as they line up with the target 10 x research source you can use your elbow instead of your glove if you prefer pitchers usually use the elbow instead of the glove follow through by flicking your wrist towards your target and letting the ball roll off of your fingertips balance yourself and keep your elbows tight to hit shots in basketball line your feet up underneath your shoulders so that your toes are facing the rim bend your knees and use your lower body strength to jump as you raise the ball up in front of you keep both elbows in and line your shooting elbow up vertically with the rim release the ball above your head when you re at the apex of your jump 11 x research source snap your shooting wrist forward as you re releasing the ball to put the backspin on it in basketball you basically want to use the same mechanics for every single shot that isn t a layup you change how hard you re shooting to control the distance the ball travels hold the laces with two fingers and snap your wrist to throw a football grip the laces so that your pinky and ring finger are on the back half of the laces brace the ball on the other side with your thumb and put your index up around the back portion of the ball line your feet up with the target and raise your front elbow to aim as you throw the football snap your wrist towards your target to release a spiral where you re aiming 12 x research source the cleaner the spiral is the more accurate your throw should be if the ball is wobbling through the air it won t travel in a clean arc towards your target plant your off foot and raise the opposite arm to kick a soccer ball take a large step with your nondominant foot and plant it next to the ball while doing this raise your dominant arm to balance yourself look at your target quickly before looking back at the ball drive through the ball with your dominant foot and swing it through towards your target 13 x research source the part of the foot you use determines the speed and accuracy kick the ball with the side of your foot to keep your kicks accurate if you want more power use the front of your foot grip a gun with both hands and aim with your dominant eye to shoot for a handgun put both hands on the handle and point your index finger down the barrel on a rifle or shotgun place your nondominant hand on the secondary grip or under the barrel hold the gun up and use the sight at the end of the gun to line the barrel up with your target gently press the trigger instead of pulling it hard to maintain your aim as you fire off a round 14 x research source assume that the gun is always loaded and never point it at anyone keep your finger off of the trigger and the trigger guard until you re about to shoot if you can fire the shot while you re exhaling or during a break in your breathing pattern to avoid accidentally moving the sight off of your target stabilize your bow and hold the fletch under your chin to fire an arrow line your feet up with the target and point your toes away from you at a 90 degree angle to the target bend your knees very slightly draw your arrow and nock it back against the string with your finger sling aim with your dominant eye and draw the arrow back so the arrow rests under your chin line the shot up with the sightline on the bow and hold the position as you release the arrow 15 x research source line the arrow up so that one fletch points directly towards this will ensure that the arrow travels flat out of the bow you don t need to hold the bow tight as you re aiming in fact your body should be relaxed as you aim to keep the arrow lined up with your target draw the arrow straight back if you pull it back at an angle you may not fire a clean arrow if you need to increase the distance raise the angle of the bow not the arrow throw a knife by tossing it downward like you re throwing a ball get a knife designed for knife throwing hold the handle by tucking it in between your thumb and index finger lift the knife up slowly behind your ear and focus on the spot you want to throw the knife hurl it forward and release the handle by letting it slide out of your hand without flicking your wrist 16 x research source you must use a knife designed for knife throwing for this these knives have heavier blades than normal knives since you have to throw a knife by gripping it by the lightest portion you d need to hold the blade if you use a regular knife it is not safe to do this if you flick your wrist as you throw you ll decrease the odds that the blade stays stable enough to hit the target cleanly axe throwing is done almost identically to knife throwing the only difference is that you can use two hands to grip the handle you still throw it overhand like a baseball and your goal is to not flick your wrist as you release

how to walk a slackline,if you ve ever wanted to walk a tightrope high above the circus floor but got nervous just thinking about it stack lining may be for you slacklining an increasingly popular practice in the balancing arts involves walking across a bouncy highly tensioned single piece of webbing that may be only a couple inches off the ground most of us have an inner equilibrium that can enable us to perform extraordinary balancing feats but getting up on the line can still be scary remember how intimidating it seemed to balance on a bicycle without training wheels now think how easy it turned out to be walking a slackline just takes confidence and a bit of practice,start with a short slackline the shorter the distance between the two anchor points the more stable the slackline as the slackline gets longer a few things happen the tension in the line increases making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force the height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted it requires more force to tighten it which can be difficult with some tightening systems place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline starting barefoot is a good idea using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel as you improve practice turning your feet and standing sideways with your shoulders parallel to the line once you improve or if the landing is not safe for bare feet you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing you can mount the slackline at any point but starting in the middle is generally safer since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling the line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted reducing the height of the falls practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors the wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle but wherever you start it is going to wobble a lot this is natural everyone wobbles the first time take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself if you are relaxed your foot will be less shaky on the line focus intently on a single point such as the anchor this will help you find and keep your balance resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well look ahead instead of down at the line put your arms out wide slightly bent and keep an upright posture center your weight directly over the foot on the line with one smooth balanced motion stand up on that leg balance on one foot while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance bend the leg that is on the slackline bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out knee s bent head up and eyes focused on a single point repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds practice with the other foot once you can keep your balance attempt taking a step once you ve successfully taken your first step keep practicing these are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line balance on one foot by yourself balance on the other foot balance with both feet one behind the other on the line take small steps forward take small steps backwards mount the line sideways shoulders parallel to the line with both feet one at a time turn on the line additionally learn how to fall safely as a beginner you will likely be on a short low to the ground slackline most of the time you can land on your feet as you try new tricks the slackline can throw you as you lose your balance the best solution is to use the throw of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet if you are thrown off balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact you can also try starting with training wheels one way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you this takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line as you get better have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble when starting out you can aid each other while learning to balance have a spotter stand walk next to the line if you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on you ll soon find that you don t need training wheels any more once you ve mastered the basics experiment with new tricks surf the line mount the line on your knees start from a sitting position sitting on your foot which is on the line and standing up then repeat sitting down yoga positions this is hard do it slowly and maintain control jump forward on the line switch from one foot to the other 180 s 360 s do cartwheels hula hoop while you slackline juggle while you slackline back flip off the line this trick is easier than it looks practice on a trampoline first once you get that down try it as a dismount then try to land a back flip on the line,Sports-and-Fitness

how to build a slackline,for many people slacklining is a sport a hobby and more it s like tightrope walking at a safe distance from the ground and requires very little setup in fact you can build your own slackline at home with ordinary climbing gear you will need to anchor the line to a couple of trees or posts to create a bouncy tensioned line to walk once you have your supplies you can set up a line within minutes,choose thick tubular webbing for the slackline and slings slacklines are typically made from nylon cords 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm wide you will need a long piece for the slackline and 3 smaller slings to anchor the line for the main line 50 ft 15 m is a good length for beginners get shorter lines 10 to 15 ft 3 0 to 4 6 m long 1 x research source the cords along with other components are available online and at outdoor activity supply stores get the webbing and other supplies you need in one go by purchasing a slackline kit online stores and outdoor activity suppliers sell them you can make a slackline out of other material including car tow lines or bungee cords purchase line lockers and carabiners to connect the webbing pick up 2 line lockers and 5 carabiners to set up your line the line lockers are metal rings that prevent the slackline from coming undone make sure the carabiners are oval shaped and climbing strength to ensure they support your weight on the line 2 x research source you can also use metal rings from the hardware store or rappel rings from an outdoor activity supply store select strong anchor points to tie the slackline to find 2 trees posts concrete walls or other solid objects measure the distance between them to make sure your slackline is long enough shorter spans are easier to learn on and allow you to keep the line closer to the ground 3 x research source for a 50 ft 15 m line look for anchor points about 20 to 30 ft 6 1 to 9 1 m apart the distance between the anchors has to be about 20 ft 6 1 m shorter than your slackline so you can tie the line around them make sure the anchors are capable of sustaining 500 to 1 000 lb 230 to 450 kg of force if the anchors feels loose in the ground don t use them fragile surfaces like wood walls aren t safe anchor points if you don t have anchor points available you will need to make some build your own a frames or purchase them in a kit cut wood boards to create the a frame components you will need approximately 4 2 in 4 in 5 1 cm 10 2 cm planks about 8 ft 2 4 m long this will be enough to create 2 a frame use a miter saw set at a 22 5 degree angle wear safety goggles ear muffs and a dust mask if you cut the boards yourself you can also rent a saw at a home improvement store or have store employees cut the following boards 4 x research source 2 planks 18 in 46 cm long 2 planks 20 3 4 in 53 cm long 4 planks 36 in 91 cm long 2 planks 37 7 8 in 96 cm long arrange the boards in an a shape on a workbench set the boards out on a flat surface so you can fasten them together work on 1 a frame at a time to create the frame place the 2 medium boards on the sides fit the remaining boards between these medium boards place 1 of the long boards at the bottom then fit the shorter boards at the top and in the middle 5 x research source each a frame uses 5 boards when you re done the boards will create the shape of an a make sure all of the boards fit snugly together clamp the boards and drill pilot holes through them countersinking pilot holes prevents the boards from cracking and weakening use a drill with a 3 4 in 1 9 cm countersink bit to drill a pair of holes in each of the middle boards measure about 2 in 5 1 cm from the ends of each board then drill the holes diagonally into the side boards 6 x research source work from the bottom edges of lower support boards in the middle of the a frame for the small board at the top drill through the side boards to reach it use a pair of wood clamps to hold the boards in place as you work bolt the boards together with 2 1 2 in 6 4 cm decking screws place a screw in each of the pilot holes the screws will pass through the support planks and into the frame planks on the side make sure the boards fit together well and feel sturdy when you try to move them that way they won t fall apart when you re walking on your slackline 7 x research source cut plywood to fit over the a frame the plywood creates a spot for you to attach the slackline and anchor lines you will need a 8 in 20 cm sheet of plywood 1 2 in 1 3 cm thick for each a frame you wish to make set the a frame on top of the plywood then trace its outline with a pencil cut the outline using a reciprocating saw 8 x research source you can also use a jigsaw or circular saw to cut the plywood to avoid cutting the plywood too short leave it a little longer than the outline you can always cut it down further or sand it but you can t fix it once it s too small for the a frame fasten the plywood to the a frame with 2 in 5 1 cm decking screws place the plywood over the a frame place a screw about every 12 in 30 cm along each of the boards in the frame screw through the plywood and into the frame boards to secure everything together 9 x research source the frame boards are a little difficult to find underneath the plywood feel for the solid boards through the plywood if you re unsure lift up the plywood to locate them outline them with a pencil to help you place the screws drill a pair of holes through the plywood to create anchor points use a 1 1 2 in 3 8 cm drill bit to make the holes position them underneath the top board on the a frame make the holes about 2 in 5 1 cm apart use a reciprocating saw or another tool to remove the wood between the holes 10 x research source basically you create a slot in the a frame to thread the slackline webbing through tie the a frames to anchor points using nylon webbing find an anchor point for each a frame one way to do this is by planting metal stakes or struts firmly in the ground use extra line lockers and carabiners to run the webbing from the stakes to the slot in the a frame make sure the stakes are well planted so the frames can t move when you touch them 11 x research source another way to plant the a frames is by burying concrete cinder blocks in your yard tie a chain around each cinder blocks then run the chains to the a frames to preserve the webbing for longer sand your a frames smooth before using them secure a sling to the first anchor point at waist height position the loop of webbing about 2 to 3 ft 0 61 to 0 91 m off the ground for a 15 to 20 ft 4 6 to 6 1 m slackline loop the webbing tightly around the tree then connect the ends with a carabiner 12 x research source before using trees for anchors cover the bark with padding like a towel or carpeting if you re creating a longer slackline you may need to raise the slings up further to keep the line off the ground if the line touches the ground when you climb onto it take it apart and raise the webbing hook the slackline to the sling with a carabiner fold the first 12 in 30 cm of the line over on itself to create a small loop push the loop through a line locker to keep the slackline secure later then pull about 5 in 13 cm of the line back around and through the line locker again to create a double loop clip a single carabiner to it 13 x research source pull on the line to make sure the sling feels secure in the loop if it feels loose take it out of the line locker and carabiner then knot it again place a line locker and carabiner about 80 of the way from the second anchor lay the slackline out on the ground between the anchor points walk towards the loose end of the line and the second anchor point estimate when 80 of the line is behind you then pull the line through a line locker tie the end of the line to a carabiner using a double loop like you did earlier 14 x research source you can usually get a good estimate of where to place the line locker by looking at the line as you walk if you need to measure it out with a ruler or tape measure for example if you re using a 20 ft 6 1 m line place the line locker 15 to 16 ft 4 6 to 4 9 m along the slackline wrap 2 slings with carabiners around the far anchor point place the slings on the anchor point closest to the free end of the slackline keep the slings close together connect the ends of each sling with a single carabiner lay the carabiners on top of one another positioning them so the gate parts that open face in opposite directions 15 x research source remember to protect trees by placing padding underneath the slings test the slings when you re done to make sure they are knotted tightly in place loop the slackline around the carabiners to anchor it in place bring the slackline underneath and through the lower carabiner on your anchor point then pull the line back towards you and through the carabiner with the line locker pass the line under and through the upper carabiner on the anchor point finally pull the line underneath and back through the carabiner with the line locker 16 x research source this is called a primitive 4 carabiner pulley system it can be a little tricky to get at first but it s a safe fun way to create a slackline without any extra tools or knots if you have a ratchet system attach the ratchet to an anchor point then feed the slackline webbing through it 17 x research source pull the line toward the far anchor to tighten it grab onto the tail end of the slackline and pull it towards the first anchor with the single carabiner get the line moderately taught enough to keep it from sagging tighter lines are better for bouncing and doing tricks adjust the line to get the amount of tension you desire 18 x research source if you re using a ratchet pull the ratchet handle down to tighten the line don t tighten it too much keep at least a little slack in the line to prevent it from snapping you may need help pulling a line over 30 ft 9 1 m have a friend help you pull the line another way to pull a long line is by installing a pulley system hook the pulley to the anchor point run a cord from the locking anchor in the line to the pulley then tug the webbing through the pulley to tighten it 19 x research source test the line by sitting or bouncing on it climb onto the line walk across it or bounce on it a little bit to stretch out the anchors and knots make sure the line feels secure but doesn t touch the ground when you walk the middle of it 20 x research source if the line needs adjustment tug on the end of the slackline to tighten or loosen it if you need to raise the line loosen it first before untying the webbing around the anchors release the line by pulling it in the opposite direction pull the tail end of the line away from the anchor point to undo it this is very safe and easy to do in a primitive pulley system once you have lowered the line removing all tension from it unhook the carabiners to take down all of the webbing 21 x research source if you re using a ratchet unlock the ratchet to release the tension pull the slackline out of the ratchet to take it down,Sports-and-Fitness
how to sandboard,sandboarding is a great option when the surf s poor the snow s gone or the skateboarding areas are crowded this activity combines elements of snowboarding surfing and skating allowing you to board on sand dunes instead of snow or water to sandboard start by getting the proper board and protective gear then find sand dunes nearby and do a first run you can also try stopping and turning on a sandboard with enough practice you ll be boarding down the dunes with ease in no time,rent a sandboard at a facility close to a sand dune many areas with sand dunes offer a rental service

us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source renting a sandboard may be a good option if you do not want to have to buy a sandboard right away repurpose a snowboard or surfboard you don t plan on using again in a pinch you can use a snowboard or surfboard you already own to try sandboarding a snowboard with a square or twin tail is ideal a smaller surfboard sometimes called a boogie board is good for sandboarding as it will not be too long make sure the snowboard or surfboard is smooth on both sides so it will glide well on the sand buy a sandboard at a local surf shop or online sandboards are usually made of wood metal or plastic they should be about 9 to 12 millimetres 0 35 to 0 47 in thick 140 to 160 centimetres 55 to 63 in wide and 100 to 120 centimetres 39 to 47 in long get a longer or shorter board based on your size and height look for a board with a square or twin tail so it glides nicely on the sand 2 x research source sandboards can be pricy ranging from 150 200 usd get a sandboard with bindings if you plan to board standing up bindings are straps that are attached to the board and are designed to hold your feet in place when you are on the board if you prefer to glide down the dunes on your stomach you do not need a board with bindings most surf shops and some snowboard shops will offer sandboards talk to a sale representative in the store to find the right board for you wear a helmet and protective gear you can go fairly fast on a sandboard especially if you find a good dune that slopes downhill make sure you always wear a helmet and elbow pads to protect your head and arms you can also wear knee pads if you are riding the sandboard standing up 3 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source you should also wear sunscreen with at least 15 spf sunglasses preferably with anti glare and long sleeves to protect yourself from the sun when you are out on the dunes visit a national park with unprotected sand dunes many national parks in desert areas or areas with a dry climate will have sand dunes sand dunes that are protected or off limits to the public will not be an option you may need to travel to a specific national park that is known for its sand dunes to try sandboarding 4 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source check online on national park websites to see if they have sand dunes you can access for sandboarding contact sandboarding companies to ask them where you can sandboard in your area go to a desert or a beach with sand dunes if you live close to a desert find out if it has sand dunes that you are allowed to board on some beaches in warm climates will also have natural sand dunes you can use to try sandboarding contact your local government land agency or department to find out if you can access a nearby desert or beach for sandboarding some tourist companies will offer desert or beach tours that include trying sandboarding on sand dunes sign up for a tour so you can try this fun activity in a safe monitored environment head out to the sand dunes early in the morning to avoid the heat aim to be out on the dunes by 8 9 am so you can enjoy a few hours of sandboarding before the day heats up going to the sand dunes early can also help you avoid sandstorms and bad weather that tends to hit in the mid afternoon in desert areas 5 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source in the spring it can get pretty windy in the afternoons around sand dunes avoid going out in the afternoons in the spring if you want to have a few good runs on the sandboard wax the bottom of the sandboard use a small amount of sandboard wax on the bottom of the board rub the wax across the board from the back to the top and a small amount of the edges of the board take a handful of dry sand and rub it over the wax to help smooth it out apply sand to the board until it no longer sticks on the wax 6 x research source slide the board back and forth in the sand bottom down so the board glides easily in the sand do not use wet sand on the board as this can cause your board to stick to the sand as you ride lie down on your belly for a less strenuous run make sure you are facing in the direction you are heading down the dune keep your arms and legs tucked into the center of the board you will need to use a sandboard with no bindings to be able to lie down on your belly comfortably stand with your feet in the bindings for a more challenging run sit down and strap your feet into the bindings make sure your dominant foot is in front of the board pointing in the direction you are heading down the dune 7 x research source you should be able to rock back on your heels when you are strapped into the bindings start on a small dune with a flat starting point look for a dune with dry sand that has a 4 to 5 m 13 to 16 ft slope make sure there are no shrubs sticks shells or obstructions around the dune or at the bottom of the dune 8 x research source place your board downhill if you are standing on the board keep your weight centered and your knees slightly bent shift your weight forward and keep your hips and shoulders stacked on top of each other turn your head in the direction you are heading and keep your arms relaxed at your sides 9 x research source if you are lying on your belly keep your body in the center of the board with your legs tucked in and your chin up push off the dune to gain speed if you are standing tip your weight slightly forward and slide the board until it moves down the dune if you are lying on your belly use your hands to push yourself off the dune keep your weight centered as you ride down the dune if you are standing allow the board to pick up speed as you ride down the dune keeping your back leg strong and your weight in the center of the board if you are lying on your belly keep your arms and legs tucked in and your chin up as you slide down the dune avoid leaning forward or shifting your weight too far forward as you ride 10 x research source stretch your hands out to help you balance as you ride you should slow down as you reach the bottom of the dune and come to a gradual stop run back up the dune with your board to do a second run there are usually no lifts to carry you back up to the dunes so you will have to run back up the dune on your own do another run on the same hill to get the hang of sandboarding then challenge yourself to do a bigger dune or a dune with a bigger slope you may need to wax your board again between runs to keep it smooth and help it to slide on the sand practice slide stops you will need to be standing upright on the board to try stopping and turning techniques start by finding a small dune with a slight slope place the board facing downhill put your weight in your heels and keep your toes up then drop your toes down so the board lies flat and you slide slowly down the hill lift your toes and dig your heels in to stop 11 x research source you can also try this facing uphill repeat the same steps lowering your heels down to slide backwards and then raising them up to slow down to a stop try doing a full stop at the bottom of a dune once you have mastered slide stops you can try doing a full stop once you ride down a dune pick a dune that ends in a flat straight line as you come to the flat sand at the bottom of the dune shift your weight to your front foot and slide your back leg outward move your shoulders and hips frontward so you are facing towards the bottom of the dune raise your toes and slide your back foot out until you come to a stop on the edge of your board 12 x research source keep your weight even on both feet so you slide smoothly to a stop practice turning on a small dune begin by riding straight down a dune then shift your weight forward and lift your back heel rotate your hips of where you would like to turn and let your body lean into the turn keep your hips and legs centered on the board as you lean make sure you give yourself time to turn as it may not be a slow turn if you are in deep sand or sand that is slightly wet practice turning in different directions by lifting your back heel and rotating your hips while you are on the board it may take some practice to be able to turn at faster speeds or as you come down steeper dunes,Sports-and-Fitness
how to use a pogo stick,jumping on a pogo stick is fun and different from the usual bike or skateboard riding at first it can be challenging to use a pogo stick but with a little practice you will be able to use it with ease and maybe even learn tricks,make sure that the pogo stick is in good condition if it squeaks when you push down on it has missing parts or is falling apart do not use it it could pose injury to yourself or others make sure you are within the proper weight limit limit is usually around 143 lbs most pogo sticks state the weight limit either on the directions or directly on the pogo stick if you exceed the weight limit you will not be able to pogo as high and it may be a safety risk also make sure you are wearing adequate safety gear as riding a pogo stick can be dangerous when you are first learning be sure to start on a hard surface outdoors with lots of room not grass your pogo stick will sink into the dirt wear a well fitting helmet and if you want elbow pads knee pads may make it harder to hop on the pogo stick check to make sure the pogo stick is safe check the pogo stick for loose parts before you get on make sure that everything is secured and fastened properly you don t want an important piece to fall off while you are jumping 1 x research source wear a helmet always wear safety gear before you get on a pogo stick especially a helmet also make sure to wear elbow pads and knee pads always wear shoes that lace up and have rubber soles never use a pogo stick barefoot or in sandals make sure your laces are properly tied and far from the springs 2 x research source get the correct size pogo stick if you are below 5 5 use a pogo stick that is 46 inches use a pogo stick that is at least 51 inches if you are between 5 6 and 5 11 if you are 6 or taller make sure to use a pogo stick that is at least 56 inches avoid uneven ground such as grass or dirt your pogo stick could get stuck in the ground and you could fall don t use the pogo stick in traffic or in the middle of the street be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye out for pedestrians cars bikers skate boarders and skaters 3 x research source learn to balance if you struggle to balance you can practice your balance off the pogo stick use a balance board before you get on to work on not falling this will help you learn to keep control of the pogo stick once you get on stand in a split stance on the board and try to keep the board still try putting your feet with one foot in front of the other then slowly rock the board back and forth very controlled put your feet side to side slowly and controlled tilt the board from one foot to the other 4 x research source get on the pogo stick make sure the pogo stick is facing outwards put the pogo stick vertical and place one foot on the foot rest hold on to the handle bars and put your other foot on the pogo stick try not to put all your weight on one foot as you get on or you might fall over 5 x research source place both hand on the handlebars and grip firmly push down with one foot hard on one of the foot bars start jumping so you don t lose you balance immediately start jumping on the pogo stick when you get both feet on jump towards the pedals not away from you keep your arms on the handle bars and use them to stay steady and keep your balance keep the pogo stick close to you don t push it forward you will have trouble bouncing and you might break your stick 6 x research source try just doing one or two bounces at first then get off this will give you the feel for the pogo stick 7 x research source as you push one foot down bring the other foot onto the other foot bar now that you have both feet on the feet bar hold on tight to hop push down with your legs by crouching down and hop up by pulling gently but quickly up on the handlebars while standing up completely do this motion several times and you will be hopping just bring your bottom down near the floor and jerk up on the handlebars don t jump too high if you jump high you could lose control of the pogo stick and fall only jump high enough to be bouncing up and down slightly off the ground 8 x research source lean in the opposite direction of the way you tip if you start to fall over in one direction lean your body away from how you are falling don t lean too hard or you might fall over in that direction or you could start going in circles 9 x research source don t do anything you aren t ready to do you might have seen people online or friends doing stunts with pogo sticks only do what you are comfortable doing and don t do anything you are not ready to try make sure you can do regular jumping with ease before you attempt any tricks 10 x research source jump with one foot once you have control of your pogo stick you can try jumping with one foot start jumping how you normally would when you have a good rhythm going take the foot off the pogo stick that is not dominate if you are right footed take off your left foot lean to the side of the pogo stick that does not have a foot on it to try to center yourself perfectly jump with no hands to jump without any hands start jumping how you would normally jump then use your knees to get a good grip on the pogo stick slowly take your hands off of the pogo stick handles make sure to continue to jump securing the pogo stick with your knees and using your knees to pull the pogo stick up once you start jumping with no hands have somebody give you a ball you can use a basketball and shoot it in a basket while you are on the pogo stick care for your pogo stick and yourself while using it do not leave it in the rain snow or any extreme weather this may cause rust and other problems do not leave it unattended it could get stolen keep it clean a buildup of dirt or grime could slow the pogo stick down and make it harder to hop if a piece comes off or starts to come off such as the rubber bottom stop use immediately and fix it get it fixed or replace the pogo stick a missing piece could be dangerous do not attempt tricks until you are very good at the pogo stick you have supervision by someone who can help in an emergency and proper safety gear a helmet do not use the pogo stick in dangerous places such as streets near edges near stairs or near skateboards do not pogo near small children they could get seriously injured by your pogo stick do not attempt to go down or up stairs you could and probably will hit your face on them keep your pogo stick in temperatures closest to room temperature as possible,Sports-and-Fitness
how to ride a bull,the most dangerous 8 seconds in sports if you want to test your mettle against a snorting bucking angry bull you need to learn how to train properly that means getting experience riding the buck becoming familiar with the bull and most importantly knowing how to hang on with ancient roots in greek culture it s safe to say men have been compelled to ride bulls as long as ranches and horse riding have existed it s an experience and a thrill like no other see step 1 for more information,apprentice to an experienced bull rider to learn the tricks of the trade though a single bull ride takes all of 8 seconds bull riding takes years of practice and guidance from an experienced rider who ll show you the ropes aside from gaining access to bulls and the people who keep them riding bulls requires that you develop proper riding technique and touch on your animal something that you won t be able to learn overnight just as you would for any sport or trade get a coach you can work with and who ll be excited to teach you bull riding trade magazines are widely available at rural outlets and feed stores advertising a wide variety of open competitions coaching options and clinics with experienced pro riders if you want to learn the basics bull riding has historical roots in equestrian competitions between mexican ranch hands contests called charreada that tested a variety of overall skills now the sport is more professionalized and the primary governing bodies in the us are the professional bull riders pbr and championship bull riding cbr born to buck programs are widely available for youth who are interested in learning to ride bulls bull breeders hold open events to help interested parties get some experience on hot bred animals at the very least you can learn if you ve got the onions for it 1 x research source get comfortable riding a horse bareback learning to get comfortable on an animal with a relatively flat back will help you immensely if your ultimate goal is to ride bulls learn how to shift your weight and grip with your legs riding an animal that isn t actively angry and trying to get you off building core riding skills is an essential first step in riding bulls wear the basic gear while there s little required of the bull rider in terms of gear you d stand out and wouldn t be permitted to participate in most competitive rodeos if you weren t in basic cowboy gear this includes jeans button up western shirts and heeled cowboy boots generally topped with the iconic cowboy hat bull riders always wear a protective leather glove and a braided bull rope that wraps around the bull to hold on to pick a glove that s thin enough to grip tightly allowing you flexibility in your grip but also thick enough to offer some protection the rope is generally treated with resin which helps with the grip when it gets heated up consider more protective gear in competition protective helmets and other gear aren t mandatory at most arenas though are gaining popularity especially in training and practice some bull riders will wear a protective helmet similar to a bicycle or motorcycle helmet as well as a heavy vest to protect the internal organs develop your upper and lower body strength a good ride requires great balance and coordination as well as the brute strength required to hold onto a bucking bull that outweighs you by a thousand pounds bull riding training will include a great deal of basic upper body and core work outs as well as leg building exercise like squats working out your arms with bicep curls will help develop the proper strength motion in your holding arm developing a routine of squats will help build the leg strength necessary to grip the bull and hold on for dear life get familiar with your bull a commonly overlooked step in the bull ride is getting somewhat familiar with the bull you re going to be sitting on top of spend a few minutes watching the bull in its pen getting a sense of his aggression and tendencies watch the bull when he s ridden by other riders most bulls buck in one of two ways head down spinners and straight ahead buckers if your bull puts his head down and turns upon leaving the gate you ll know to shift your weight slightly and prepare for a tilt a whirl ride if your bull tends to head in a straight line you can prepare for a more north south type of bucking action and prepare yourself accordingly a common misconception is that bulls testicles are bound to get them to buck their flank is bound gently to get them to kick their back legs higher but their testicles are not touched or harmed in any way mostly they re bred to buck that way hold your grip correctly when you re mounting the bull get an experienced bull rider to show you how to wrap your hand in the bull rope and get a solid grip generally bull riders grip underhand with their dominant or writing hand though some other grip techniques are becoming more popular let a helper pull your rope tight and wrap the rope once around the part of your hand that is closest to you for a basic grip place your riding hand in your rope with the back side of your hand down your pinkie should be right next to the bull s backbone sit correctly ease up to where you are nearly sitting on your hand make sure you stay that way for the entire ride and sit up off your butt all of your weight will be on the inside of your thighs lean forward so that your chest is over the bull s shoulders when you mount hold on to each side of the chute and ease your toes down on the bull s back and slide them down his side do not touch him with your spurs until you are ready to ride be calm and focus on the task at hand some bull riders will say that the most difficult part of the ride happens when you re still in the chute waiting at some point when you re sitting there on top of a monstrous big bull who s huffing and angry that he s got an uncomfortable flank strap tied on to him it might occur to you that this is a bad idea stay focused and think about the motions and the balance that you need to achieves not the animal it ll be over soon hold on as the bull s front feet come off the ground lean forward while squeezing with your legs and maintaining a tight grip on your rope with your riding hand which acts as your center of balance on the animal keep your hips centered and square when the bull starts to come down from the jump push your hips to your rope and lift with your riding hand try to stay as close to the center of the bull s back as possible miscalculating your balance and shifting even a couple of inches will have you eating dirt in a second or two focus on your core balance created with your grip and your hips control your free arm many novice riders move their free arm too much as if they were doing some kind of cowboy dance while it s true you can use your arm to offer some counterbalance it s probably the least important part of the ride watch pros closely you ll notice for the most part that their free arm is fairly static that s because most of the balance and the control they re getting is in the hips and the grip focus on those things and on keeping your free arm out of the way if you inadvertently slap the bull with your free arm at any point during the ride you won t receive a score it s important to keep control of your arm while also letting it counter balance and rudder yourself on the animal get out of the way you re not going to stay on the bull for much longer than a few seconds so learning to get safely away from the bull and landing without seriously injuring yourself is a critical part of the riding process to dismount wait for the bull to kick and then look over your riding arm the one your hanging on with and throw your opposite leg over the bull s head try your best to land on your hands and feet then run to the gate that s closest to you stop and look to see where your bull is then go grab your rope to get clear understand how scoring works you ll only receive a score if you stay on the bull for at least 8 seconds the time ends when either your free hand touches the bull or you feet touch the ground and starts as soon as the bull s shoulder passes the gate the rider and bull are both given scores for their performance which are tallied together to give the overall score the bull is judged primarily on his difficulty judges look for the depth of the bull s drops the height of his kicks the directional changes and the speed of his spins to determine a score the rider is judged primarily on the skill with which he controls the bull anticipates the directional changes and gracefully maneuvers and dominates the animal rider and bull are given a score between 1 and 25 which are added together to give either a score out of a possible 100 or divided in half to give a score out of 50 ride the buck don t ride the bull experienced and skilled bull riders are in some ways more like surfers than like wrestlers it s not so much a test of animal wrangling as it is an ability to feel out the animal s movements and bucking pattern in general thinking less and feeling more will allow you to ride the buck more effectively the only way to do this is to practice like a demon ride bulls and stay healthy lose your feet lose your seat this is sometimes called the bull rider s mantra it serves to remind you that most of the control and balance you ll achieve while on the animal comes from your lower body gripping the bulk of the bull with your thighs and feet spurring if necessary to control the bull s aggression without doing this you re going to end up with a dirt lunch commit it to memory both mind and muscle stay on as long as possible simply put the longer you stay on the better your score will be 8 seconds is a lot longer than it seems so learning to channel all of your attention and strength into an extremely short period of time is the biggest challenge to the rider practice increasing the length of your rides and getting comfortable negotiating different bulls some riders suggest practicing on north south type buckers before graduating to spinners which are more

how to ride a mechanical bull,the use of mechanical bulls was originally intended for bull riders in training but now they ve become a popular activity at parties and western bars across the country if you want to impress people with your bull riding skills you ll need to master mounting the bull assuming the correct positioning and balancing so you can stay on as long as possible follow these steps to master bull riding and maybe even win a prize in a bull riding contest,jump up and bring 1 leg over the bull to sit in the saddle most mechanical bulls are surrounded by bouncy padded flooring use this padding to hop up and get your right or left leg over the bull then use your hands and arms to steady yourself on top your legs should hang down on each side of the bull s back 1 x research source some people might have trouble initially mounting the bull because it is too high this is why you should use the padded flooring to your advantage try not to jump too high because you might miss and jump over the bull completely hold on to the rope palm up with your non dominant hand mechanical bulls will either have a padded strap or a long rope handle that you can hold on to use this after you jump up on the bull to stable yourself and adjust your positioning it is best to hold on to it underhanded with your non dominant hand 2 x research source holding on to the rope underhand allows for the best stability when the bull is in motion it also helps you to release your grip more easily when you fall move your body forward in the saddle and squeeze it with your thighs it s best to position your body as far forward on the saddle as you can this will help to minimize your movement which will ultimately keep you on the bull longer once you are far up on the saddle squeeze the sides of the bull with your thighs so you are firmly rooted to the bull s body 3 x research source pull your legs forward position your legs forward and avoid angling them behind you when you re sitting on the bull if your feet are behind you it will be harder for you to balance while the bull is moving and you may fall forward on the bull if it moves down 4 x research source dig your heels into the bull s side once your legs are positioned correctly dig your heels into the sides of the bull and point your toes outward this will allow you to get a better grip on the bull with your feet 5 x research source don t use your toes to try to hold on to the bull they do not have enough strength to keep a good grip relax your upper body in order for your bull ride to last a long time you ll need to make sure your entire upper body is relaxed if you re too stiff the momentum will swing you off the bull and you ll fall over quickly a relaxed body during a mechanical bull ride will resemble a flag waving in the wind your upper body should sway along with the bull s motions 6 x research source raise your dominant hand in the air for balance hold onto the rope with your non dominant hand and raise your dominant hand in the air to balance yourself to do this keep your arm in an l shape instead of holding it straight out or up in the air while the bull is in motion use your best judgment to move your arm around so that it keeps you in place 7 x research source keeping your dominant hand free is the best option to break your fall if you happen to lose your balance keep your eyes on the bull s head avoid the urge to look out into the crowd at your friends while you re riding the mechanical bull it is best to keep your eyes on the back of the bull s head the entire time this will help you to watch for directional changes and ultimately keep balance looking up will distract you and you ll have trouble adjusting your body when the bull changes directions 8 x research source move your upper body in a seesaw motion when the bull is in motion its body will be moving up and down like a seesaw you ll need to mirror these movements with your body in order to stay on as long as possible when the bull s head goes down lean your upper body back so you don t fall forward when the bull s head goes up lean all the way forward so you don t fall back 9 x research source make sure you continue to keep your body loose while you re making these movements if your body is rigid you ll be thrown off pretty quickly always maintain a firm grip with your legs while you re moving forward and back with your upper body sway your upper body slightly right or left when the bull turns the mechanical bull will also be swaying left and right and spinning in circles you ll want to adjust your body to these movements as well if the bull goes left try to lean a bit right if the bull goes right then try leaning a bit left when the bull spins in circles try to lean in the opposite way to keep your balance 10 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness

how to play boxball,boxball is a game played between two players hitting a ball back and forth between separate but adjoining squares the goal of this game is to prevent the ball from bouncing twice in your square before sending it back to the opponent boxball can be played outside or inside of a gymnasium to take part in boxball you will need to prepare a court play the game with an opponent and practice regularly for improvement 1 x research source,choose a location this game can be played outside or inside if played outside you will need to find a location with asphalt or concrete boxball is typically played on the sidewalk but it is okay to play on an asphalt court as long as there is enough room if played inside only play in a designated area in a gymnasium 2 x research source do not play boxball inside of your home or inside of any location that is not meant for sports playing inside could lead to items being broken or damaged by the bouncing ball don t play on grass the ball will not bounce well find an opponent luckily you do not have to find an opponent that is already skilled in the game boxball is a fairly easy game to learn you can play with a friend family member or schoolmate just make sure the other person is willing to play 3 x research source you may want to choose your opponent based off of your experience level you can play with another beginner if you re also trying to learn or you can play with a more advanced player to better your game wear athletic clothing you can wear any type of comfortable clothing to play stretchy clothing made for exercise is ideal wear athletic shoes with gripping soles especially if you are playing on an indoor court 4 x research source you can also wear knee pads elbow pads hip protectors and and wrist protectors for added protection get a ball the most ideal ball for this game is an 8 5 inch inflatable rubber ball these balls are typical in schoolyards and they are commonly referred to as kickballs if you do not have this type of ball you can play with any type of ball that bounces a larger ball however is preferred 5 x research source a spaldeen ball was originally used in the game it is a smooth pink rubber ball that is similar to a kickball 6 x research source a basketball can be a good alternative but make sure it is not too hard it may hurt your hand when throwing it back and forth you can also play with a tennis or ping pong ball but the small size might make playing difficult make a court if playing outside there is a possibility that you do not have to make a court yourself boxball was originally played on two sidewalk squares you will just need to find two spacious and adjoining sidewalk squares if you aren t in an area with sidewalk squares you can make a court yourself to make a court you will need to use tape to create squares make the squares 8 feet wide but you may want to make them smaller if you are a beginner 7 x research source use one inch masking tape chalk can also be used to draw squares choose a square to begin each player will need to choose a square it is best to start standing in the middle of the square once you are in one of the two squares stand facing your opponent the line between the two squares is the boundary do not cross this boundary at any point in the game 8 x research source do not step outside of any of the lines of your square at any point in the game agree on the rules boxball can be played using one or both hands to hit the ball either choice is okay but you need to make a decision with your opponent you might want to start by playing with both hands if you are a new player 9 x research source you are allowed to use a reverse shot if you play with only one hand a reverse shot is when you can use the back of your hand to hit the ball back volley to choose who serves first to volley one player hits the ball into player two s square player two hits back and forth until one person fails to return the ball or steps outside of his or her own court the winner of the volley gets to serve the ball 10 x research source the serve can be maintained by the winner of the volley or it can be rotated every five points a serve is made any time a hit has been missed or when a player goes out of bounds defend your square hit the ball with an open palm back and forth to your opponent return the ball before it hits the ground or when it bounces only once a point is gained when the opponent misses a shot or volley goes out of bounds or hits the ball outside of the opponent s square 11 x research source you have also lost the volley if you try to return the ball after it has bounced twice play until someone reaches twenty one points continue slapping the ball back and forth with your opponent until someone reaches twenty one points you gain one point when your opponent loses a volley you must beat the opponent by two points to win 12 x research source the score could go beyond twenty one in order for someone to win by two or more points train regularly the main way to improve at boxbal is to play regularly try playing a couple of times a week if you can t find anyone to play with you can practice hitting the ball back and forth by throwing the ball up against a wall 13 x research source do not throw the ball up against any wall without permission the wall needs to be sturdy like brick on the outside of a building play with a variety of opponents play with as many people as possible so you gain experience with a variety of opponents for improvement you might want to play with someone who is slightly more advanced at the game than you are playing with someone who is much more or less advanced can lead to frustration instead of conscious improvement it can be an occasional confidence booster to play with someone who is new to the game playing with a beginner will show you how far you ve come and you will be helping someone improve his or her game form a team you can agree with one person to practice on a regular basis find multiple people to play with for more challenge and variety boxball is only played with two people but you can have several games going on at a time switch opponents after each game in order to play multiple games with several opponents within a practice session 14 x research source you need an even number of people if you want to have multiple games going on at a time this will give each person a partner during every game play similar games boxball has been called an outdoor game of ping pong and a very small version of tennis boxball is also comparable to four square four square is a similar game but it is played with four people the rules and materials are not the same in these games but playing these games will help develop skills needed to excel at boxball 15 x research source tennis requires rackets ping pong requires paddles four square is played with the same ball as boxball and you only use your hands,Sports-and-Fitness
how to polish a foil ball,polishing a foil ball typically refers to the process of compacting and sanding a roll of aluminum foil to create a shiny metal ball if you ve got 4 5 hours on your hands to pound buff and polish the ball the result will be incredibly mesmerizing while balling up and polishing your ball takes quite a bit of time you can pick it up or put it down at any point to do this in multiple sittings you re sure to impress your friends and family by turning a regular old roll of aluminum foil into a reflective smooth sphere,find the softest nicest aluminum foil that you can find you can do this with the cheap stuff but higher end aluminum foil is usually heat treated which really makes this process easier go online or stop in your local grocery store and pick up a roll of nicer aluminum foil look for food service grade stuff if you can otherwise pick out a standard roll of foil 1 x research source anything marketed as thin will usually be really good for this avoid the thicker or heavy duty versions this stuff isn t particularly easy to work with for this get a 15 20 ft 4 6 6 1 m roll if possible more than that will require a lot more work less than that will result in a really small ball crumple and ball up the entire roll as you pull it out of the package open the aluminum foil package and pull out the first 1 2 feet 0 30 0 61 m or so crumple and compress the aluminum foil into a ball shape and pull more of the foil out to repeat the process try to avoid breaking the foil and don t worry too much about the shape it s got a long way to go before it s a ball 2 x research source if you break the roll try to put the broken piece in the center of the ball and surround it with the unbroken piece you can also simply toss the broken piece out or start over if you prefer compress the foil by hand to shape it into a sphere pick the foil up in your hands and compress it together like you re trying to squeeze a basketball from both sides turn the foil around and continue pressing it the closer you can get to a solid circle the easier the next set of steps will be do this for 5 10 minutes until you ve got a clean ball 3 x research source rotate the ball while tapping it with a mallet to compress it even further set the ball down on a table and grab a rubber mallet the wider the mallet the better brace the ball with your nondominant hand and gently rotate the ball while tapping it with the mallet this will remove all of the air bubbles inside and compact your ball do this for 15 20 minutes until you have a compact sphere 4 x research source you can tell when you re done by squeezing the ball if there isn t a ton of give you can move on to the next step be sure to hit the ball from every angle to keep the density of the sphere uniform repeat this process with a hammer to compress the ball swap the mallet out for a hammer repeat this process by striking the sphere while rotating it be extremely careful when doing this to avoid hitting your hand or striking the table do this for 15 20 minutes until your sphere is so compact that there s no give when you squeeze it 5 x research source at this point it should be kind of difficult to ruin the shape of the ball if you do end up warping it simply strike the area that s sticking out of the sphere until the shape returns sand the surface of the ball with a sheet of 100 grit sandpaper grab a sheet of sandpaper or a sanding brick with 100 grit put a cloth in your nondominant hand and use it to hold the ball in the air from underneath then gently brush the surface of the sphere while rotating the ball in your hand use a combination of single direction strokes and circular buffing motions to remove the exterior layer of the sphere do this for 10 15 minutes 6 x research source you re probably going to knock off some aluminum dust the cloth will keep it from covering your table continue sanding the ball using increasingly finer grits this may take some time but it s the most important part of the process if you want a clean sphere repeat the sanding process using 120 320 400 600 and 800 grit sandpaper in that order wrap a cloth underneath the ball to catch any residue and scrub the ball using back and forth strokes spend 15 30 minutes using each grit to thoroughly smooth the surface out 7 x research source this should take a few hours if you re aiming for a really beautiful sphere you don t need to do it all in one sitting if you have other things to do or get tired of sanding by the time you re done you should have a really impressive ball it should look like one piece of foil and you shouldn t see any ridges or edges in the material perform the final sanding with 1000 grit sandpaper under cold water turn your sink on and grab a sheet of 1000 grit sandpaper hold the ball under the water and give it one more thorough sanding do this for at least 15 20 minutes the fine sandpaper will smooth out any microscopic grooves while the water will wash any blemishes or foil dust away 8 x research source you can do this in a bucket filled with water if you prefer grab some polishing cream and a chamois cloth there are a few ways to get the lustrous shine you re looking for without a doubt the easiest way to do this is with a metal polishing cream pick up a small container of metal polish from your local hardware or big box store you ll also need a chamois cloth to buff the sphere and work the polish into the foil so pick one of these up as well 9 x research source you can use a microfiber cloth if you don t have access to a chamois cloth but the chamois will make it a bit easier to buff the ball dip the cloth into the polishing cream and rub it into the ball take your chamois cloth and dip it into the container to pull up a thick glob of polishing cream you can always scoop up more cream so the amount doesn t necessarily matter gently rub the ball with your chamois cloth to cover the surface of the aluminum foil with your polishing cream 10 x research source work the cream into the surface using your cloth rub the cloth firmly in the ball while rotating it in your hand scoop up more polishing cream if you feel the ball drying out use a combination of back and forth strokes and circular motions to work the cream into the ball keep doing this until the ball starts reflecting light and shining 11 x research source you can use a drill with a fabric attachment to make this process easier if you d like re sand the ball with your polishing cream if it isn t starting to shine if the ball still isn t reflecting light you may need to sand it a little further grab a 1000 to 2000 grit sanding block and pour a bead of polish directly into the sandpaper then sand the ball with the polish loaded sanding brick the same way you polished it before do this until the ball begins to shine 12 x research source don t forget to rotate the ball by turning it in your hand to sand every side the goal at this point is to spread the polish out evenly into your aluminum foil wipe the excess polishing cream away with a dry cloth grab a clean dry cloth and wrap it around the ball massage the ball thoroughly with the cloth to wipe away the excess polish now you have a lustrous ball 13 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play pickleball,pickleball is a fast paced game that combines elements of tennis badminton and ping pong it s an extremely popular paddleboard sport partly because it doesn t require much equipment and it s super easy to learn and play all you need are paddles a pickleball and a pickleball court whether you re playing singles or doubles learn the layout of the court and follow a few simple rules for an exciting back and forth competition,find a pickleball or badminton court to play a game pickleball and badminton courts have the same size measurements but a pickleball court will have the net lowered to the ground so it s at a height of 34 inches 86 cm search online for pickleball courts near you or find a gym that has badminton and pickleball courts that you can use to play a game 1 x research source pickleball courts can be located outside or indoors play with 2 people for singles or 4 people for doubles pickleball can be played with 2 people competing against each other which is known as singles play or with 2 teams of 2 people playing against each other which is called doubles play games of singles and doubles both use the same court have the same number of faults before losing their serve and are often played to 11 points 2 x research source doubles is the most popular way to play pickleball use 1 pickleball and have each player use a pickleball paddle pickleball specially designed paddles which are smaller than tennis racquets but larger than ping pong paddles each player needs to have 1 paddle you also need to use a pickleball which is a lightweight ball with holes through it like a whiffle ball 3 x research source there are a variety of colors you can choose for your pickleball stand behind the baseline of the right service court to start a game a serve which is the strike that starts a game or round of pickleball is always performed from behind the baseline which is the 20 ft 6 1 m line at the end of each side of the court when you re starting a game of pickleball stand behind the baseline on the right side of the court 4 x research source the 2 squares in front of the baseline are known as the right and left service courts once a game is in play you ll alternate which service court you stand behind to serve hit the pickleball with an underhand strike below waist level to serve it hold the pickleball at your side with 1 hand and hold your paddle steady with another when you re ready to serve drop the pickleball and strike it with an underhand motion with your paddle 5 x research source if you hit the pickleball above waist level or if the ball bounces off of the ground then it s a fault clear the net so the ball bounces once on the opposite service court aim for the service court diagonally across from you when you serve the pickleball so it bounces on it once avoid hitting the net with your serve or hitting the pickleball past the opposing team s baseline before it bounces off of the ground in the opposite service court 6 x research source for example if you re serving from behind your right service court you must bounce the ball once on the opposing team s right service court which is diagonal across from you if your serve hits the net or goes past the opposing team s sideline or baseline before it bounces on the service court then it s a fault switch to the other service court when you score a point when you serve the pickleball and it bounces off of the opposing team s service court the ball is in play and is hit back and forth until a fault is committed such as the ball going out of bounds hitting the net or bouncing more than once on the court if the opposing team commits a fault when it s your serve then you score a point whenever you score a point start your next serve from behind the other service court 7 x research source for instance if you serve the pickleball from behind the right service court and then the other team commits a fault and you score a point your next serve will be from behind the left service court only the team that is serving can score a point allow the other player or team to serve when you commit 2 faults if you re playing singles or 1 on 1 you get to commit 2 faults before you turn over the serve to the other player so they can have a chance to score if you re playing doubles or 2 on 2 whenever a player on a team commits a fault then their partner gets to serve whenever the team commits 2 faults then the other team gets to serve 8 x research source score a point when it s your serve and your opponent commits a fault after the ball is served and the 2 bounce rule is observed both teams volley the ball back and forth and keep it in play whenever a team commits a fault such as the ball going out of bounds or bouncing twice on the court then the play stops and the ball is served if it s your serve and the opposing team commits a fault then your team earns 1 point 9 x research source if it s your team s serve and you commit a fault then no points are awarded however if you commit 2 faults then it becomes the other team s serve wait until the serve bounces on the service court before returning it when the ball is served it must be allowed to bounce 1 time on the service court once the ball bounces on the service court use your paddle to return the ball to the other side of the net so it can bounce on 1 of the service courts 10 x research source the return ball can be bounced on either of the opposing team s service courts allow the return to bounce once on the court before you hit it back the two bounce rule requires both the serve and return ball to bounce 1 time on the service court before the ball is allowed to be volleyed back and forth after you send your serve and the opposing team returns it wait until the ball bounces on the service court and then hit it back over the net with your paddle 11 x research source if the return ball doesn t land on one of the service courts to bounce then it s a fault and the serving team scores a point hit the ball before or after it bounces once the two bounce rule is followed once the two bounce rule has been observed volley the ball back and forth by hitting it either before it touches the ground or after 1 bounce keep the ball in bounds and avoid hitting the net as you hit it to the other side 12 x research source you can t hit the ball more than once or pass it off to a teammate if the ball bounces on sideline or baseline then it s still in play if the ball hits outside of the lines then it s out of bounds which is a fault avoid standing in the kitchen when you re volleying the ball the kitchen also called the non volley zone is the small rectangular zone in front of each side of the net you can t volley the ball if you re standing in the zone or if your foot is on the line or it s a fault before you volley the ball back to the other team make sure you aren t in the kitchen 13 x research source it s also a fault if a serve lands in the kitchen continue volleying the ball until a fault is committed keep the ball in play and hit it back and forth to the opposing team there is no limit to the number of volleys you can perform if it s your serve and the opposing team commits a fault then your team scores a point and the ball is served again if you commit a fault while it s your serve then you get to serve the ball again and no points are scored if you commit 2 faults while it s your serve then the opposing team gets to serve 14 x research source games of pickleball are often played to 11 points with 1 team needing to be ahead by 2 points in order to win however tournament games can go to 15 or 21 with a team needing to be ahead by 2 points in order to win score 11 points to be eligible to win a game as you play a game keep track of the points that are scored by each team once a team reaches 11 points they re eligible to win the game if they already have a 2 point lead whenever they reach 11 points then they win the game 15 x research source for instance if the score of a game is 10 to 4 and the team with 10 points scores again then they win the game earn a 2 point lead once you have 11 points to win once a team scores 11 points if they have a 2 point lead then the game is over and they win but if a team scores 11 points and they don t have a 2 point lead then the game continues until they do 16 x research source for example if you score 11 points but the opposing team has 10 points then you must score another point to make the score 12 to 10 in order to win the game play 3 total games to decide the winner of a match pickleball is fast paced and points are scored often so matches of pickleball usually consist of 3 total games win 2 out of 3 games in order to win a match 17 x research source some pickleball tournaments may have matches of 5 games,Sports-and-Fitness
how to learn a racing line,the techniques of automobile racing are quite different from the techniques of street driving and for more reasons than just that the vehicle travels faster perhaps the key aspect in race driving that street drivers do not face is making the car turn as efficiently as possible it is difficult to get the mass of a high speed racing car to change direction and to do so while keeping the speed up as much as possible what works to the advantage of the racing car driver is that he does not have to stay in a lane a race car can be directed over any available portion of track to create the ideal racing line the racing line is the line of travel that allows the driver to turn the car while losing as little speed as possible if the line takes a bit more distance than the obvious direct turn which it always does that is part of keeping the speed of the car up and not wasting any more time and energy than is absolutely needed to decelerate into the turn and accelerate out of the turn use these tips to learn a racing line,determine the apex of the corner the apex is the point on the corner that the racing line needs to run through for best effect the apex of a corner is the point in the turn where the corner transitions from forcing the car into the turn to opening out to allow the car to complete the turning motion and resume a straight course it is the point at which the radius of the corner comes closest to the road edge understand the importance of the apex definitions of racing line often refer to hitting the apex hitting the apex means that rather than hugging the road edge in the turn the car starts out wide from the corner sweeps in to just hit the road edge at the apex and begins to sweep back out again ideally this line begins at the farthest possible side of the track from the apex sweeps across the track to hit the apex and continues to sweep out to the farthest possible side of the track leaving the corner this line straightens out the corner into a longer but softer one and the car can take the softer turning required at speed without losing traction and spinning out it also means that the car comes out of the corner already at high speed and ready to race on without needing to accelerate as much as it would have had it hugged the corner at lower speed plan the application of power through the turn all braking should be done in advance of hitting the apex braking and beginning the turn towards the corner called the turn in point should be delayed as long as possible determining the limits of turn in and braking must be found through trial and error as each racing car has different balance and braking capabilities once the apex has been hit accelerate as hard as possible once past the apex the car is out of the danger of spinning in the turn and should be brought up to straight line speed as quickly as possible plan for the continuation of the track beyond the corner what follows the corner on the track will affect the line chosen for the corner prepare for the straightaway if the corner is followed by a long straightaway the basic apex technique will work however many drivers intentionally change the line for a late apex clipping the road edge later than the classically defined apex if the corner is followed by a long straightaway this late apex allows a racing car with good acceleration to apply power before the apex is hit this technique is not recommended for slower racing cars smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb b bc learn a racing line step 4bullet1 jpg v4

set up for the next corner if the next corner is turning in the same direction as the corner that was just negotiated simply follow the racing line for the first corner and it will drift the car out wide for the following corner which is where the driver wants the car to be however if the next corner is in the opposite direction as the one that was just negotiated the car comes out of the first corner on the wrong side of the track to take the second corner the exit from the first corner must be flattened rather than allowing the car to sweep out which gives time to get the car back across the track for the following corner this is accomplished by taking a later apex but not applying full power out of the first corner smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 3 3a learn a racing line

sustain energy during endurance activities ideally you ll want to spend at least 12 weeks in the base training phase of your training after that you can work into the build phase when you improve your skills in the various disciplines you ll gradually ramp up the intensity of your training sessions until you reach your peak within weeks of the race itself invest in a heart rate monitor if you don t already have one and keep track of your heart rate while conditioning during base training you shouldn t move beyond the first two zones the recovery and endurance zones this equates to between 50 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate at your peak training level you ll be working at around 80 percent of your maximum heart rate focus on duration since adventure racing is an endurance sport your conditioning workouts need to be at least as long as the race itself is going to be training yourself to go longer will make a shorter race easier and give you more room to increase your pace 4 x research source if your adventure race is more than 12 hours long use a marathon training plan try to do most of your running on trails rather than on a paved road if your adventure race is less than 12 hours in duration you can follow a half marathon plan you can spend as little as three or four days a week training but you may want to train for five or six days a week particularly when you are doing lower intensity exercise during your base training stage remember that an adventure race is an endurance event you re not going to train for a 12 hour race by working out 20 minutes a day three or four days a week not training enough is a good way to ensure you ll get wiped out or worse injured within the first few hours of the race don t push yourself too hard when you have a grueling adventure race in mind it can be easy to go too hard during your first weeks of training however pushing your body to its limit during conditioning can lead to injury 5 x research source your training is a time to focus on your skills and technique when you re working at full intensity it s difficult to correct your form or even pay attention to small details lower intensity workouts on the other hand give you the opportunity to make small tweaks that will increase the efficiency of your movements during the race working at a high intensity is a good way to get injured during training and never even get to the race especially if you re training nearly every day training at a lower intensity means you don t need as much recovery time between training sessions transition to hill running and walking hiking and hill climbing work different muscle groups than running or walking on flat ground so after a month or so of base training you can start to incorporate these activities into your routine 6 x research source during your hill climbing stay at about 80 percent effort to continue to build your endurance try several sets of a hill that takes less than five minutes to climb start including interval training into your overall regimen to continue building cardiovascular strength and efficiency while you also build your strength include scrambling up hills on varieties of terrain including mud and slippery slopes this activity also uses different muscle groups and you want to make sure all are as evenly conditioned as possible replicate a variety of race conditions as much as possible so you ll be ready regardless of what happens in the race devote ample training time to each discipline review the information for your particular adventure race and figure out which disciplines will be included that way you can start dividing your training sessions up so that each discipline is covered equally 7 x research source keep in mind that if you re less familiar with one discipline you ll need to spend more time with it at least initially to bring your skills up to speed with everything else hire a good trainer or coach to teach you correct technique for disciplines with which you have little to no experience it s important to learn basic safety skills and first aid in tandem with technique for example while you should work on a good paddling technique and an efficient stroke you also should learn basic water and boat safety so you don t panic if your boat overturns for disciplines that may occur after nightfall make sure you do training at night so you re accustomed to moving in the dark practice with your race gear throughout your training you want to carry a 10 15 pound pack with items similar to what you ll be carrying during the race itself you also want to wear similar clothing and the same shoes in which you plan to run the race 8 x research source while training you ll be able to tell if your pack is uncomfortable you also can make sure that food and water is easily accessible to you when you need it and make adjustments where necessary this will keep you from panicking during the race if you can t get to something you need wearing trail shoes provides more support and protection for your feet and provide much better grip and traction on soft or slippery terrain they can also keep you from getting blisters like you potentially would if you wore regular running shoes take care of your feet and remove calluses to avoid getting deep blisters during the race especially if you re training during the day wear sunscreen year round and insect repellant in warmer months make sure you train with team members or with a coach or buddy don t go hiking alone even on a familiar trail where you ve been many times include general items in your pack such as duct tape and rope that can easily be converted into makeshift assistance or support for a team member in trouble as well as basic first aid supplies learn a strong stroke technique for paddling many adventure race competitors are triathletes which means rowing may not be their strongest discipline focusing on your paddling can enable you to build a significant time lead in the race if you have a strong efficient stroke 9 x research source keep in mind that you could be paddling in any kind of water so make sure you have experience in everything from placid lakes to whitewater even ocean swells if your adventure race will be held near the coast focus on keeping your arms fully extended and get your power from your core rather than from your arms use the twisting of your body to generate your stroke not movement in your arms find a canoe or kayak club that you can paddle with to get more experience in racing type conditions practicing in a boat without a rudder is ideal since you ll have experience steering a rudderless craft many of the boats provided by adventure race organizers are rudderless try to fit in at least one or two long paddle sessions of between one and two hours over the course of your training long strokes with good form will get you across the body of water faster than a greater number of short strokes train with a group not only is training in a group motivational but there is always safety in numbers especially if you re training in wooded areas far from the beaten path team members and training partners can help you out as well as giving you tips on how to improve your form and technique 10 x research source ideally your team members will be skilled in different disciplines so you can rely on each other to push the team forward on each leg of the race and give each team member a chance to lead include others who are skilled in specific disciplines such as rowing or climbing so you can learn new techniques from them during your training you will likely be exposed to situations that will enable you to figure out how you can help other team members out if disaster strikes out on the trail use ample lights when biking at night while affixing a large light to your bike will add considerable weight it will be worth it for the safety it provides especially if you re biking on a difficult or technical trail 11 x research source use led lights since they weigh less you may also want to wear an led headlamp keep in mind that trails typically aren t lit at all and often one wrong turn could send you tumbling off into a ravine both in training and in the race itself you shouldn t sacrifice safety in the belief that you ll make your load lighter rig your bikes with towlines and hooks so you can get bikes out of bad situations if need be retractable dog leashes can work well as towlines and won t take up a lot of room in your pack practice riding on your teammates bikes as well as your own so if you have to switch bikes or bike parts for some reason you ll still be comfortable use climbing walls to perfect your climbing technique some adventure races include a climbing or rappelling component while you may be able to go around these rock faces you ll lose precious time doing so 12 x research source unless you re going on a longer adventure race or an expedition race you may not have much use for climbing skills check the information for your adventure race carefully so you can plan your training time accordingly practicing rappelling with your team also enhances trust and bonding among team members which will be a crucial mental component going into the race when you re doing any climbing make sure your pack is secured and your hair is tied back out of your face you don t want anything to get caught up in your rappelling equipment or to fall off the side of a cliff read the information provided by the race organizers when you register for your adventure race you ll receive detailed information about the course of the race the obstacles or challenges you will face and the skills that will be tested 13 x research source use this information as a blueprint for your training regimen if there s any component of the race in which you have little experience use your training time to get comfortable with that skill and learn how to complete that leg of the race safely study the route the race will take until you re relatively familiar with it if you have the opportunity to do so you may want to do part of your training in the same area where the race itself will take place work on orienteering and navigation almost all adventure races have a navigation element which will require you to read and understand a topographical map and navigate using a compass in the age of gps systems this may be an area where you need a lot of practice 14 x research source shortchanging this aspect of preparation or assuming you ll be able to pick it up on the fly can have serious negative consequences for you and your teammates during the race buy a book or research orienteering online and study until you have the basics down then you may want to consider joining an orienteering club or attending a class or camp so you can test your skills in a real world situation if you do join a club pay attention to the technique of more seasoned members ask questions and pick up as many tricks and shortcuts as you can to make this skill easier for you to do quickly and efficiently check your equipment thoroughly in the days before the race make sure all equipment is functioning properly and any systems you ve rigged will actually perform as you ve designed them to perform 15 x research source test safety devices and harnesses to make sure they re going to operate correctly if you need them during the race make sure you know everything you have and how to access it you also should know what your teammates are carrying and how they can access their gear pack plenty of food and water for everyone including sports gels for energy and other snacks that can be eaten quickly for efficient fuel on the trail commit to your team an adventure race is a team sport whether you have a single partner or a larger team your bond with each other is perhaps more important than your speed and skill work together with commitment to each other and you will be successful 16 x research source during training as well as during the race itself be aware of your teammates at all times if someone is having a problem you ll need to be able to help them as a team and get them back in the race all team members should have mutual respect for each other and treat the event as a team effort rather than an individual effort or accomplishment get to know your teammates and their strengths and weaknesses be willing to put your ego aside if need be for the good of the team as a whole use relaxation techniques before the race on the day of the race you will likely be excited and nervous this kind of stress will not allow your body to operate at peak efficiency meditation and relaxation techniques calm your body and help you mentally prepare for the race 17 x research source visualization is a technique that works for many athletes much of your nervousness comes from anticipation of something unknown visualize yourself in your mind calmly overcoming the obstacles and running swiftly over trails deep breathing exercises also can work to relax your body and mind as you inhale think of energy coming into your body expand your chest and hold your breath for a few seconds as you exhale think of stress and fatigue that you are releasing from your body use the techniques that work for you for example if one of your teammates swears by meditation but you don t get any benefit from it respect that you and your teammates might have differences in mentally preparing and keep open minded towards your teammates,Sports-and-Fitness

how to play volleyballoon,volleyballoon is a fun variation on volleyball where you use a balloon instead of a ball it works great at birthday parties and slumber parties where you probably already have some balloons lying around it s also fun and easy to play in the classroom or living room on a rainy day blow up a few balloons grab some friends and you re ready to play,find a large space indoors make sure there isn t anything fragile around that players could accidentally knock over and break if you re playing in the living room and have a coffee table you should move it out of the way so nobody trips if you re playing in a classroom move the desks to two sides of the room with a space in the middle 1 x research source divide the space in half with a string take a long piece of string and tape it to each wall so that it is about the height of a volleyball net for an easier variation for younger children just put the string on the floor a rope or a long length of yarn can work too 2 x research source also make sure you decide on what will be out of bounds you can mark out of bounds with string or masking tape or just decide on it as a group blow up a few balloons if you need help blowing up the balloons ask an adult you ll only use one balloon at a time to play but it s important to have spares in case one of them pops don t use a helium balloon because that would just float to the ceiling and get stuck up there divide the people playing into even teams if you have twelve people get six on each team that s how many you use to play volleyball but don t worry if you have fewer or more people volleyballoon is a very casual game and can be played with any number of people decide which team is going to serve first 3 x research source if some of the team members are much taller than others like if you re playing with a mixture of adults and kids you might want to have the taller players play on their knees if you re playing in a classroom have everyone sit on top of their desks to play nobody can leave their desk during a play but you can rotate desks after each play decide how long you will play the game this is important to decide before you start so that you know who will win you can choose to play until one side reaches 25 points in which case they will be the winner that s how many points it takes to win one set of a real volleyball game or you can choose to play for 10 minutes and see which team has more points at the end talk with your friends to come to a decision now you re ready to play 4 x research source have one person serve the balloon over the dividing line serve the balloon by throwing it in the air and whacking it with the heel of your hand across the line after the balloon is served the game has begun the balloon will be in the other team s possession they will pass it back and forth between each other and try to hit it back over the line 5 x research source pass the balloon at least two times before you hit it over the line this means that at least three separate teammates will touch the balloon before it goes over the line this rule only applies if you have more than three people playing on each team it s to make sure more people get a chance to hit the balloon 6 x research source do not catch the balloon and throw it to your teammate instead hit it if you accidentally catch the balloon the other team gets a point stay on your side of the dividing line when you play don t run into the other side of the room or even reach over the net that s the other team s territory you have to stay on your side of the line if you accidentally reach over the net the other team gets a point 7 x research source if you want you can have positions and rotate each play this is helpful if you re playing in a classroom and all sitting on desks or all the teammates can just run around on your side of the net try using volleyball moves to hit the balloon you can bump the balloon by clasping your hands and hitting the balloon with both arms between your wrists and elbows if the balloon is coming from above you can set the balloon by extending your hands over your head and positioning them so that there is a triangular window between your two hands then lightly hit the balloon with your fingers 8 x research source if you don t want to do these fancy volleyball hits just hit the balloon with your arm elbow head shoulder or knee anywhere works because the balloon is soft enough that it won t hurt you keep track of the points each team has won if the balloon touches the ground on your side the other team gets a point if you hit the balloon out of bounds the other team gets a point if the balloon goes under the dividing line instead of over the other team gets a point 9 x research source play until one side reaches a set number of points or until you reach your time limit in real volleyball each set goes until 25 points and the best of three sets wins volleyballoon is more casual though so go until the time or number of points you and your group decided in real volleyball you have to win by 2 points but just 1 point is fine for volleyballoon 10 x research

how to survive if your parachute fails to open,skydiving can be one of the most exhilarating things that you may ever experience one of the first fears of people who consider going skydiving is the fear of their parachute malfunctioning fortunately you can use a reserve parachute to land on your feet unharmed even if your main parachute fails if your reserve also fails there are even tactics that you can use to improve your chances of surviving a freefall to earth,get in the breakaway position if your main parachute is malfunctioning or has become tangled it s important that you can break away from it before deploying your reserve or else the reserve parachute may become tangled to get in the breakaway position spread your legs to reduce your velocity and keep your head up with your back arched 1 x research source being in the wrong position could get you entangled in your main chute you must break away at a minimum of 1 600 feet to allow you enough time to fully deploy your reserve look and reach for the breakaway handle make sure to take the time to look down at the lever that you re pulling the release is typically found on the right hand side but you should talk to your skydiving instructor before you jump grab onto the handle with both hands and prepare to pull the breakaway handle will look like a cloth loop on the strap of your parachute pack pull the breakaway handle while looking at your reserve handle once you pull the breakaway handle throw it away keep your eyes on the reserve handle when falling at incredible speeds in a high stress situation you are more prone to becoming nervous or confused keep your concentration on the thing you must do next the breakaway handle will release your main parachute so that your reserve does not become entangled you do not have to pull the breakaway handle if your main parachute did not deploy just pull your reserve ripcord pull the reserve ripcord with both hands pull the reserve ripcord and deploy your secondary chute the reserve ripcord can usually be found on your left hand side the reserve static line lanyard is a system that should automatically deploy your secondary shoot if you detach from your main parachute but should not be relied on in the case of a malfunction 2 x research source the reserve will be on the other side of your breakaway handle and will usually be either a red cloth loop or loop made of metal 3 x research source use your steering cables and get into the landing position look up to make sure that your reserve has successfully deployed and prepare to land you ll have less time to prepare for your landing because you re using your reserve so execution is crucial to assume the landing position point your feet to the ground with your heels up and try to absorb the shock from landing with your legs use the steering cables to your left and right to guide you find a suitable place to land like an empty field avoid cliffs or other dangerous objects like power lines 4 x research source to move to the left simply pull the left cable to move to the right pull the right cable 5 x research source don t panic if your main parachute malfunctions or fails to open and your reserve chute also doesn t work it s natural to think the worst and prepare for death however it s imperative that you keep your wits about you so that you can plan how and where you

how to ride an air chair,have you ever been to the lake and seen someone sitting on a ski flying over the water and wondered what it was an air chair is a relatively new type of water sport device it is extremely unique instead of riding on top of the water like with skiing or wakeboarding you ride over the water the chair has a hydrofoil attached to a three foot long post which creates the lift to make the chair glide smoothly over the top of the water,read the air chair manual to learn the correct setup and all of the possible options setup the blades there are two blades which make up the hydrofoil the front blade is stationary and creates the majority of the lift for the second blade there is more than one option the air chair is shipped with a beginners blade which is very stable and makes learning easier the blade is somewhat triangle shaped with two fins on the bottom a secondary rear blade is much more rounded like a thick boomerang this blade makes the chair more maneuverable but also requires more practice to control well when the ends of the boomerang are pointed toward the rear it is the intermediate setting and when the blade is flipped around it creates the advanced configuration insert the wedge not only are the blades affecting how the chair rides but there are wedges which fit between the base and the blades that affect how much lift is created and the general angle of attack that the hydrofoil uses there are different sizes of wedges and the placement of the wedge will finely tune the angle it is usually best to start with the medium size wedge and experiment with the placement and move to the other wedges if you need the chair to handle differently tighten all bolts on the base and blades and insert the post into the bottom of the chair and be sure the bolt is hand tightened not too tight and the pin is placed through the shaft of the chair for extra safety hop in the water after you suit up with a life jacket and swim trunks place the air chair into the water though the air chair is heavy if the post and blades are attached to the chair correctly nothing will sink only the last few inches of the nose of the ski will be above the surface as you approach the air chair be wary of the post and blades which are below the surface that you can t see slide your legs in through the seatbelt after you loosen it strap your feet into the booties by pulling the heel strap below your foot and snugly on your heel move to the edge of the seat for most people the air chair works best if your back is at the back edge of the seat so you are sitting most of the way off the front of the seat once in position tighten the seatbelt and secure it grab the rope and align it in front of the exposed part of the ski if you are learning to get up have the boat drag you very slowly idle in a straight line try to learn to keep the air chair pointed in the correct direction steer with the rope the air chair uses leverage as it s primary means of control move the rope to the right and it will pull you to the left and vice versa control the angle of the air chair by compensating with the location of the rope this will take a lot of practice to perfect the driver of the boat will have to be patience as will you because you will get turned sideways more than once and you will fall once up more than once with the boat pulling you in a straight line try to the keep the air chair straight as the boat accelerates after you say hit it or whatever your go phrase is keep your back straight perpendicular to the ski your arms outstretched and make and minor adjustments to your direction with the location of the rope read above as soon as the ski has planed no longer being pulled through the water but on top of it lean forward to keep the ski down on the water lean forward and keep the rope high to remain on the water this is the best way to learn the basics of steering and control steering is the same as when in the water with one addition leaning like a bicycle you must lean and turn at the same time but unlike skiing or wakeboarding if you only lean to turn you will likely fall you must turn using the rope then lean into the turn to compensate for the forces put on the rope this all becomes even more important when riding on the hydrofoil rather than the ski attempt to raise the ski off the water at first it is usually best to try leaning back to bring the ski off the water as soon as you are off the water lean forward again to bring it back down keep your arms steady for now don t move them higher or lower try leaning back and forth until you get more comfortable with the idea of being above the water straighten your back so you aren t leaning forward or backward and keep your arms high this keeps you on the water lower your arms until you start lifting off the water then bring it back down by raising the rope again practice this a few times until you are able to comfortably control your height off the water just by using your arms remember if you need to go down in an emergency you can lean forward practice the basics of controlling your height until you are able to go the full length of the post on command be aware that going to high will most likely cause you to crash as air being caught under the hydrofoil will remove all lift and will bring you down to the ski in a hurry the picture at right is an example of what happens after you go too high cutting turning to the extremities of the usable water is a unique experience among water sports the air chair requires a good deal of balance and control to maneuver over the wake then to keep level as the rope pulls you at more of an angle the rope has been keeping you level while behind the boat but as the rope pulls at nearly a perpendicular angle to your motion the downward leverage is gone you must compensate by leaning forward or back to keep level jump by leaning back this is a bit of giant leap from the rest of the article but it is a natural progression and learning to jump is very easy it is the landing that is very difficult land by leaning back until your descent is slowed then straighten your back and control your elevation with the rope,Sports-and-Fitness
how to skydive for the first time,there s nothing quite like rushing to the earth at 120 miles 190 km an hour after jumping from a perfectly good airplane there are no perfect airplanes however skydiving is an exhilarating and intense adrenaline rush that can t be described you ve just got to do it here is some advice on how to go about it the right way for your first jump and hopefully many more,go to the united states parachute association s website to locate the nearest affiliated drop zone alternatives for other countries canada the canadian sport parachuting association uk the british parachute association australia the australian parachute federation call the drop zone to ask about their hours and schedule a skydive get all of your questions answered before you pay for the jump don t be afraid to ask whatever is on your mind because they ve probably already heard your question before from someone else choose the method of your first jump 1 x research source the vast majority of people choose to make a tandem jump this involves jumping out of the plane while attached via a harness to an instructor who wears a parachute big enough for both of you it requires very little training and you can just sit back and enjoy the ride while the instructor handles all the technical parts of the skydive another type of jump called an aff accelerated free fall level one jump is offered at most drop zones the training for this skydive involves a ground school course taking approximately 5 6 hours followed by a jump with your own parachute on this type of jump you will have two experienced instructors holding onto you during your exit from the plane and subsequent freefall in order to assist you with proper body positioning as well as initiating the canopy opening you will also have the assistance of an instructor on the ground who is in communication with you via radio to assist with your landing pattern and proper flaring for landing one additional option you may encounter is a static line jump this jump includes the same training as an aff level 1 jump however upon exiting the plane your parachute is automatically deployed by a line attached to the aircraft static line jumps have generally decreased in popularity in recent years and most first timers end up making either a tandem or aff level 1 jump the remainder of this article describes steps related to making a tandem jump which is the most common first time jump on the day of the jump dress for the weather on the ground and wear sneakers bring an extra layer if you want but part of the fun is feeling the rush of air and although it is colder at high altitudes you probably won t notice the difference because of all the adrenaline 2 x research source arrive before your appointment time but be prepared to wait for instructors to become available the weather to break etc even though you ll only be free falling for a minute plan on being there for the entire day just in case 3 x research source pay attention before your jump you will get a briefing and meet your instructor this will help you enjoy your skydive much more they will fit you into a harness that will connect to the instructor and the parachute board the plane and just soak it all in before you reach the jumping altitude between 9 500 feet and 17 500 feet the instructor will clip your harness onto theirs at this point you are literally joined at the hip exit the plane listen to your instructor on how they want you to do this because every plane and every instructor student combination is different enjoy it enjoy the feeling of falling at 120 miles 190 km an hour and feeling free as a bird the sensation is like no other it feels like you are floating but the rush of air tells you that you are falling 4 x research source enjoy the view once the instructor deploys the parachute you have a 360 degree view of the beautiful earth from about 5 000 feet 1 524 0 m your instructor may loosen your harness at this point for your comfort don t worry they won t drop you land safely once again listen to your instructor on how to land sometimes you ll stand up for the landing other times you ll slide in softly it depends on a lot of factors 5 x research source brag you just did something that most people don t have the courage to do enjoy the accomplishment get certified if you enjoyed your first skydive and want to do it again talk to the instructors and the people at the drop zone about how to get certified it takes a lot of time money and effort but you ll find that skydivers are among the happiest people on the face of the earth,Sports-and-Fitness

how to pack a parachute,when you go skydiving you ll want to make sure that your parachute is always going to open a key way of doing this is by packing your parachute properly,check the owner s manual first if there are instructions in the manual then use them to pack your parachute those instructions are designed for the specific parachute you are using and will ensure that the parachute opens properly do a full line continuity check of your parachute and follow any instructions for setting the brakes use both hands to pick up the lines use your fingers to separate each line group as well as the steering line hold the lines and walk towards the canopy make sure there are no twists in the risers and lines step to one side outside of the lines and place the lines over your shoulder starting with the end cell nearest your leg flake the leading edge nose of the canopy pull out each cell and place them next to one another once you have counted all cells take the entire nose in one hand and rear riser line groups in the other hand give the canopy a little shake right to left place the nose between your knees and hold it there while you flake the rest of the canopy flake the fabric between each line group beginning with the a and b lines locate the a lines by finding the line tabs closest to your body on most 9 cell canopies you should have five line tabs for each line group on most 7 cells you should have four put your hand between the a lines and the b lines to fold the fabric out to the side your fabric should be neatly folded to the outside and the lines should always remain in the center of the pack job repeat the same flaking process between the b and c lines for the d line group find the line tabs closest to the tail not the steering lines which are attached to the trailing edge after flaking one side repeat the same process on the other side quarter the slider by distributing the fabric equally front to back and side to side then push the fabric down in the center of the pack job like you see in the photo reach down and pull up the trailing edge tail place the middle point of the tail just above the slider and hold it in place with one hand use your free hand to make sure all cells of the nose are still neat check that the slider is in line with the cells i e not pulled out in front of the cells or pushed into the center of the pack job take care not to disturb the flakes when rolling the tail a few 1 rolls of the tail are recommended and only what is needed to keep the fabric under control for folding and getting it into the deployment bag maintain even tension on the lines and use your free arm to support the canopy while you lay the canopy down gently take care not to disturb the flakes and symmetry of the pack job follow the container manufacturer s instructions on cocking your pilot chute remove as much air from the canopy as possible and dress the canopy to a width as close to the width of the deployment bag as you can make your first s fold by bringing the tail end of the cocoon the end with the warning label towards the top of the canopy in the shape of an s the goal here is to fold the canopy into a shape that will easily fit into the deployment bag at this point if the tail has come undone and your slider grommets are not firmly against the slider stops you should go back and re do those steps make your second s fold by lifting the top of the canopy and folding it towards you and then over itself again in the opposite direction pull the bag over one side of the folded canopy and push the fabric firmly into the corner to fill the entire bag pull the bag over the other side while using your knees and hands to maintain control of the fabric roll the bagged canopy towards the closing flap keep as much fabric inside the bag as possible and keep the lines neat follow your container manufacturer s instructions for closing the bag line stow methods vary by container manufacturer,Sports-and-Fitness
how to discern what is a paraglider and what is not a paraglider,historically people have stepped through visual and sound cues to discern type of aircraft especially during war others make a hobby of stepping through identification cues in discerning the species of birds well there is confusion in aviation about just what a paraglider is or is not here we take steps to form a decision about what kind of hang glider we might see is what we see a paraglider or not incomplete and even false definitions about what is and is not a paraglider arrive from cult and commercial influences such is inadequate for a creative student of aviation an inventor a seeker of options in free flight an engineer an author a teacher etc what is wanted is a path to clarity about just what is and is not a paraglider apart from narrow interests of course for the narrow interests they know what they know let s go for more and for clarity,locate the tethers does the aircraft have one or more tethers at least one tether is needed find the wings does the aircraft have one or more wings at least one wing is needed it is narrow perspective and false to force soft canopy for the set of wings certainly there are soft canopy paragliders but there are also stiff framed paraglider and fully solid wings may be the wing or wings of a paraglider find out how the aircraft deals with free falling mass does the aircraft have a freely falling mass at the lower end of the tether or tethers some mass is needed to be pulled by gravity at the end of the tether or tethers that go up to the wing or wings check to make sure the tether maintains tension in flight does the tether generally stay in tension because of the deflective actions of the coupled wing or wings with the mass at the lower end of the tether or tethers if there are other objects in the aircraft that have the potential to propel the aircraft up or forward then are those in off status a paraglider is unpowered if powered then it becomes a powered paraglider when the aircraft is set into free fall does the aircraft glide even a small positive amount with the above steps cleared one probably has a paraglider in focus you will notice that some hang gliders that are not regularly called paragliders are actually mechanically paragliders you have done the steps of how to discern an aircraft type congratulations,Sports-and-Fitness
how to shoot an arrow,archery has been around for thousands of years and remains a fun challenging activity to this day whether you re doing it for sport competition or food knowing how to properly load aim and fire your bow will make the difference between a whiffed shot and a bullseye,line your body up perpendicular to the target when you re ready to shoot line yourself up so that if you drew an imaginary line from yourself to the target the line would go across your feet if you are right eye dominant hold the bow with your left hand point your left shoulder to the target and handle the arrow and string with your right hand if you are left eye dominant do the reverse stand upright and place your feet shoulder width apart pinch your buttocks together to bring your pelvis forward keep your back erect so that when you pull the string your arms and shoulders form a t shape your stance should be comfortable enough to hold for long periods of time but also firm and alert 1 x research source point your bow down and attach an arrow to the string point your bow toward the ground and place the shaft of an arrow on the arrow rest attach the back of the arrow to the bow string via the small plastic component with a groove in it called the nock if the arrow has 3 vanes or fletching feathers orient the arrow so that a single vane points away from the bow then place the arrow below the nock bead or if there are 2 beads in between them 2 x research source use 3 fingers to lightly hold the arrow on the string if you re shooting with a sight place your index finger above the arrow and your middle and ring fingers below this is called the mediterranean draw or split finger style if you re shooting without a sight place all 3 fingers below the arrow which will bring the arrow closer to your eye use your thumb to support the back of the arrow and keep it straight 3 x research source point your bow toward the target with your fingers on the drawstring raise your bow and hold it out toward the target your inner elbow should be parallel to the ground and the bow should always remain vertical when held properly you should be able to look straight down the spine of the arrow 4 x research source use 3 fingers to pull the bow s drawstring back toward your face use your back muscles for strength and let your arm stay as relaxed as possible keep pulling until the bow feels tight then use your chin ear or another body part as a reference point that way you can draw the string back to the same spot each time 5 x research source try to draw the string as far back as possible this increases accuracy and dampens the effect of wind and gravity when you pull back the string lift your elbow up this makes your shoulder muscles work instead of your arm muscles aim at your target most casual archers will use a technique known as instinctive shooting in this method simply point your bow so that the tip of the arrow lines up with your target if you want to fine tune your aim try purchasing an adjustable sight that attaches to the front of your bow when shooting you can either close your non dominant eye or keep both eyes open 6 x research source release the arrow by relaxing the fingers on your string hand the goal is to get a clean release meaning the bow leaves your fingers with as little slowdown and interference as possible while this may sound simple the manner in which you release your fingers from the bowstring can impact the arrow s flight and any unintended flinches or wobbles can knock it off course after releasing the arrow wait until it hits the target to lower the bow 7 x research source do not move your hand forward to boost the arrow while you shoot remain still for the best shot possible pay attention to the bow s recoil or follow through as it may indicate problems with your form pull or crank the string to cock the bow if you re using a manual crossbow place your foot into the stirrup located at the front of the bow then pull the string toward the back of the device until it cocks make sure to keep the string as even as possible for crank crossbows attach your crank to the device if necessary then simply turn the crank until the bow cocks 8 x research source load the crossbow with an arrow after cocking the bow place a crossbow bolt or arrow into the barrel of the device and line the cock vane up with the barrel channel for safety load the arrow from the top of the device keeping your hand away from the main chamber and the front of the bow at all times 9 x research source bring the bow to your shoulder similar to a rifle bring the crossbow up to your dominant shoulder and either push it into the pocket of your shoulder or let it sit on top of your shoulder then place your non dominant hand below the crossbow to steady it making sure to keep your fingers away from the main chamber do not freehand your crossbow as it can lead to inaccurate and dangerous shots 10 x research source freehanding is when someone holds their crossbow in 1 hand and attempts to shoot it aim your shot using the bow s sight pin or scope if your crossbow has a scope peer through it and line the aiming reticles up with your target make sure to check your scope s user manual so you know what each reticle means if your device does not have a specialty scope line up your shot using the crossbow s peep sight or other alignment device 11 x research source fire your crossbow when you re ready to shoot hold your crossbow steady and double check your scope or sight then pull the trigger like you would on a gun when the arrow releases you ll hear a slight pop from the trigger 12 x research source determine your dominant eye with archery eye dominance is more important than hand dominance because your dominant eye is what will handle aiming and judging distances to figure out which of your eyes is dominant point your finger toward a distant wall or object and close 1 of your eyes if your finger appears to jump you closed your dominant eye 13 x research source buy a bow that matches your dominant eye most archery equipment is labeled as right handed or left handed in reference to which hand pulls back the bowstring if your dominant eye does not line up with your dominant hand purchase equipment for your weaker hand though it may take your hands some time to adjust picking gear based on your eyes will boost your precision 14 x research source typically you can use crossbows in either hand choose arrows to go with your bow for crossbows look for bolts that adhere to the length density and nock recommendations given by your bow s manufacturer when dealing with drawstring bows purchase arrows that are about 2 in 5 1 cm longer than your draw length if possible purchase high quality arrows made from carbon fiber aluminium fiberglass or wood 15 x research source if you re planning to shoot targets get arrows with field point heads if you re going hunting use broadhead or blunt tips instead judo points are also used they have small clasps that grip onto the prey after you shoot it to find your draw length pull back your bow as if you were going to shoot it then have a friend measure the distance between the front of the bow and the back of the string purchase protective gear certain pieces of equipment are essential for ensuring both a safe and enjoyable shooting experience some items to consider buying include an arm guard to cover you bow arm and protect it from bowstring slaps a plastic chest protector to prevent string burn along your chest gloves or a finger tab to protect your hands from string injuries and a quiver to hold your arrows 16 x research source the finger tab glove is the most important without it you can get permanent nerve damage even on a 20 lb bow trying to tough it out is not a good option even if you have developed callouses by playing guitar or something else buy targets and other practice equipment for archery the best way to practice is with a personal target these come in a variety of forms including bag targets which work well for simple point heads foam targets which can handle notch and broadheads and 3d targets which look like wild animals zombies and other creatures along with targets consider buying things like strength training bars release trainers practice bows,Sports-and-Fitness
how to sight a bow in,archery is popular for both hunters and for those who like to practice their skills on a target range as with any weapon hitting a target with a bow is not easy you cannot simply point the weapon in the general direction of the target and have any realistic hope of hitting it the process of sighting in a bow maximizes the chances of hitting the target sighting in a bow allows the archer to compensate for arrow drop due to the pull of gravity over distance and disturbances caused by the firing procedure at the time of aiming see step 1 below to learn how,set aside a few days you will want to spread your sighting in over a few sessions this is because fatigue will affect your accuracy and power and your form will most likely shift spreading out the sighting over a few days will result in greater overall accuracy 1 x research source buy the sight bow sights come in many styles and should be chosen to meet the preferences of the archer 2 x research source bow sights are available at sporting good stores and specialized archery supply outlets if you re just planning on hunting with the bow you can use a simple sight that should only set you back around 40 competition sights can cost 5 times this or more this guide is for sighting in a fixed pin sight it is the most common sight and is recommended for hunting and recreation mount the sight to the bow follow the instructions provided with the sight for proper installation most sights are attached to the riser and are secured by a couple of screws most bows have pre drilled holes for attaching sights do not overtighten the screws as you could damage the bow the sighting pins of the sight should be lined up vertically with the bow string 3 x research source the bow sight should be at a right angle to the bow after installing the sight let it settle overnight you may have to tighten it further after it settles set all sighting pin adjustments to the mid point this will give you maximum room for adjustment in either direction as needed 4 x research source an allen wrench available at hardware stores will be needed to adjust the sighting pins set up the target and mark your ranges ideally you will want to be able to mark off every 10 yards 9 1 m from the target at least up to 40 yards 36 6 m use a range finder if possible for accuracy range finders are available from hunting and outdoor supply stores try to use a durable target that can take a lot of arrows as sighting in the bow can take some time and a lot of repetition set your 20 yard first pin move to the closest distance to the target which is usually the 10 yard 9 1 m mark stand so that your body is perpendicular to the target and draw an arrow back with your bow look down the sight at the top pin and shoot your arrow at the target repeat with a few more arrows 5 x research source take note of where the arrows hit compared to the site if the arrows went above what the pin was indicating move the sight box up on the bow repeat this step until the arrow is not shooting above the top pin step back to 20 yards 18 3 m repeat the sighting process raising the sight box if necessary once the arrows are not hitting above the top pin you can make adjustments for arrows going too far left or right by moving the sight left and right respectively don t worry about perfect accuracy yet this pin will most likely change set your 30 yard second pin once you deem your 20 yard 18 3 m top pin suitably accurate you can move back to the 30 yard 27 4 m mark on your range aim down the sight using the second pin and fire off a few arrows at the target start making the same adjustments that you made while sighting in at 20 yards 18 3 m 6 x research source remember to move the entire sight box when making adjustments at this stage take the time to make the 30 yard 27 4 m pin as accurate as possible because it will not be changing this will be the anchor of your sight move back to 40 yards 36 6 m shoot arrows at the target while looking at your 40 yard third pin in the sight when you make you adjustments this time move the pin itself instead of the entire sight box you won t be moving left and right with the sight box anymore instead focus on making the 40 yard 36 6 m arrow go to exactly where the pin is pointing 7 x research source the distance between the 30 and 40 yard pins will be greater than the distance between the 20 and 30 yard pins if you need to readjust your left and right sight placement return to the 30 yard 27 4 m marker on the range and make your adjustments there check your 20 yard 18 3 m shot again once you ve set the 30 yard 27 4 m pin and made adjustments to your 40 yard 36 6 m pin go back and shoot at 20 yards 18 3 m again this time make adjustments to the pin itself instead of the whole sight move back and sight any additional pins depending on your sight you may have additional pins for 50 yards 45 7 m 60 yards 54 9 m and more move back from the target and repeat the previous steps moving the pin to make adjustments 8 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to start archery,archery has been around both for sport and hunting for centuries and it remains popular today while it is not too hard to get involved in it requires more than sports like soccer or basketball to get started you should find a club where you can take lessons from a live person as this is the best way to learn then you can pick the right safety equipment and find a bow that fits you well you ll also want to try out different angles and target types master the basics and practice as often as you can when you first get started,look for archery clubs near you archery is not a sport that you should try to start on your own search online for an archery club near you and visit it meet the people who work there and tell them you are brand new to archery and would like some advice about getting started 1 x research source if you are in school or college you may be able to find an archery class or club within your school school programs are a great way to get started when you are researching you may find archery organizations that meet and compete you may also find stores shooting ranges that sell equipment offer lessons and have shooting facilities if you can t find a club near you there s most likely someone in your area who has archery experience ask people you know if they know anyone who would be willing to teach you the basics and possibly loan you some equipment to get started call and find out what services they offer many clubs might have meetings for beginners and more advanced shooters you can ask if they have equipment you can test and possibly rent a club near you might also sell equipment which you can ask about rather than showing up at the club without warning it s helpful if you let them know ahead of of time you are a beginner and want to learn they may want you to bring id of some kind or they can tell you about any fees they may have some clubs may require you to pay for a membership and if you are unsure about how invested you want to be you may want to look for other archery clubs learn from a live person while you can watch videos and read about the proper techniques nothing beats learning from an experienced archer they can help you position yourself properly and check your form and tell you how to adjust 2 x research source if you have a friend or family member who has been shooting for a while talk to them and ask if they could give you some beginner lessons archery clubs often have classes for beginners which is the best way to learn when you have no experience take an introductory course the benefit of this is that an intro course will be specifically designed for people with no archery knowledge you ll learn about common archery terms how to stand and hold the bow and what safety precautions to take when you shoot archery has specific techniques like how your feet should be placed how far to pull the string back and how to aim taking a course will teach you these plus give you the time to focus on them in a supportive setting if you find a club near you that does not offer courses look for another one that you could take a course at even if it s a little farther away once you get the basics you could then practice at your local club test for eye dominance although your dominant hand may seem more important the dominant eye will affect how you see the shot and therefore affect your aim performing an eye dominance test will help you figure out which side of your body to hold the bow on form a triangle by putting your thumbs together and forefingers together choose an object that s about 15 feet away and situate it in the middle of the triangle close your left eye and determine if the object stays centered or shifts test with the right eye as well the eye that keeps the object centered is your dominant eye this is important because bows are designed specifically to be held with either the right or left hand so it s important to know which is best for you rent or borrow the equipment when you first start archery equipment is pricey and you don t want to make that investment until you know for sure that you want to stick with it many archery clubs will loan or let you rent equipment 3 x research source you can also find a friend or acquaintance that will let you use their equipment while you learn if you can t find any rental options at clubs near you find out what kind of return policy they have if you use the equipment for a while and decide that archery is not a good fit for you choose a bow with the proper poundage poundage also called draw weight is a descriptor of how much weight it takes to pull the bow string back your size and strength will determine the poundage that will serve you best this is one of the things an expert at an archery club can help you with 4 x research source for example a child starting out would want a draw weight between 10 20 lbs depending on their size a large man would want at the highest 35 lbs choosing a draw weight that is too high for you will make shooting too difficult but it can also cause injury in your arms because you ll strain at pulling the string back you also don t want it to be too easy to pull the string back as this will cause you to over pull the string use safety equipment even experienced archers often use arm guards and shooting gloves finger tabs an armguard will protect you from the snap of the string while a shooting glove tab will protect your fingers from the strain of pulling the string back 5 x research source besides the safety aspects these are also good for accuracy and smooth shots the armguard keeps your clothes from catching on the string the glove aids a smooth release of the string there is no shame in using help and taking extra precaution when you first start out when you get comfortable you can decide to stop using safety equipment if you want a chest guard is another recommended piece of safety equipment it goes across the shoulder of the arm that holds the bow it serves to flatten your clothing so the string doesn t snag on them if you are shooting in the woods or around other shooters it s important to wear bright clothing usually orange to make yourself highly visible to reduce shooting accidents choose arrows based on your draw length arrows are made of wood aluminum carbon and fiberglass each with their specific benefits the material is less important than getting the proper arrow length measure your arm span and divide by 2 5 then choose arrows that are 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm longer than that 6 x research source another test is to standing perpendicular to a wall and stick your arm out straight allow the knuckles of your closed fist to rest against the wall then turn toward the wall and measure from the wall to the corner of your mouth add 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm and this is a good length for arrows master the fundamentals archery has a diverse range of options from hunting to riding on horseback shooting at moving targets before you get into advanced shooting you need to perfect your stance get comfortable with gripping and drawing the bow and become accurate at aiming another good skill is learning to account for wind or other weather 7 x research source once you have learned the basics you will probably practice without a teacher most of the time but it s good to check back in with an instructor after you ve been shooting a while they can watch you shoot and make sure you are maintaining proper form don t get discouraged if you don t start hitting bullseyes right at the beginning archery is a discipline and it can take years to become an expert shooter breathe steadily when you shoot holding your breath during a shot is a common mistake made by beginners what this does is reduce oxygen to your brain and also can affect your vision take slow normal breaths that keep you calm but don t cut off your oxygen 8 x research source since archery is a calm sport maintaining even breathing will keep you calm from start to finish of the shot a good practice is to exhale as you release the string so that your breath and the arrow are in unison determine where you can practice practicing in your own backyard or the woods near your house is fine as long as you know any local restrictions and practice safely be sure that other people are not around or that you specifically warn them before you begin shooting never shoot toward your house or toward any area where people may be it may be wise to find out if any home or life insurance policy you have has stipulations about shooting for home practice you can construct homemade targets from bales of hay or cardboard boxes you can purchase targets at most sporting goods stores hunting stores or farm stores practice as often as you can if you want to start archery as a casual hobby that you pick up once in awhile that s fine but don t expect to improve much becoming a proficient archer takes consistent practice if you can t practice everyday set a goal to practice a few times a week especially at the beginning your muscles may get sore from the new strain of archery so make sure you don t overdo it give yourself time to rest in between shooting sessions if you can practice consistently for at least the first month or so after you learn you ll have a better chance of getting the form down then your practice could slow down a little vary your angles and distances when you practice it s easy to fall into the comfortable trap of setting up a target at the same distance every time and shooting straight on however if you want to increase your skill you need to shoot from longer distances and different angles 9 x research source if you are going to hunt some day get in a tree stand and shoot downward at the target as this is likely how you ll be hunting if you typically shoot at 15 feet take shots from 20 30 and 40 feet to increase your accuracy from longer range don t do all of your practice with a single target in an open field set some targets up in the woods if you can or set up 2 3 targets and practice hitting each of them while you stand in one spot,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hold an archery bow,the right way to hold a bow depends on the type of bow you are using you hold a compound bow and a crossbow in two very different ways while the correct hold for a basic recurve bow and longbow are similar to the hold you use for a compound bow there are a few variations with these grips that you will need to keep in mind,approach the bow from an angle 1 x research source hold your dominant hand out in a position that is perpendicular to the ground turn it clockwise by about 20 to 35 degrees your fingers should be loose and spread apart in a natural relaxed manner this is the position you will need to grasp the bow with if you are using your left hand turn the bow counter clockwise instead of clockwise you need to resist the temptation to shake hands with the bow in other words do not grasp it directly from a straight angle doing so can put your hand off center with the grip so the bow is more likely to twist as you use it moreover you are also more likely to grab the bow too tightly in this position which could also lead to unwanted twisting of the wrist while shooting let the bow grip fall into the pocket of your hand with your hand still in its previous position note the pocket that forms inside the palm of your hand lift your fingers upward slightly and slide the grip into this natural pocket if you are unable to feel the pocket you might be forcing your fingers open too much doing this can cause the muscles in your palm to stretch and become tense which can cause this pocket to disappear this pocket is the only secure spot you can hold the bow with if you grab the bow grip with any other part of your hand your hand is likely to change position once you apply pressure a more precise location of this spot is where the radius bone meets the palm directly at the base of your thumb it also happens to coincide with your lifeline relax your fingers around the grip let the fingers of your dominant hand naturally hang along the handle or grip of the bow your index finger should brush against your thumb but the rest of your fingers should be relaxed and loosely curled around the handle your index finger and thumb are the only two fingers that should catch the bow after you make a shot the rest of your fingers should not press down on the bow grip at all if you have difficulty keeping the bow steady like this you may also use your middle finger to help hold the bow in place but you should never use your entire hand you may even decide to fold the bottom two or three fingers into your palm to keep them from getting in the way this is the way you should hold the bow when you are preparing to shoot an arrow hold the crossbow like a rifle 2 x research source hold the crossbow so that the back is butted against your shoulder support the barrel of the crossbow at its center of gravity using your non dominant hand hold onto the back of the crossbow around the trigger using your dominant hand the back of the bow should be positioned above and just to the inside of your armpit wrap your non dominant hand firmly on the barrel supporting it from the bottom keep your fingers out of the way of the trigger mechanism your index finger should be the only finger not bent while firing the bow alternatively bring the crossbow up above your shoulder the second basic way to hold a crossbow is similar but instead of supporting the back of the bow with your shoulder you rest the bottom back on top of your shoulder your non dominant hand still supports the barrel at its center of gravity while your dominant hand rests near the trigger securely grasp the barrel of the bow with your non dominant hand position your dominant hand so that it rests to the outside of the bow your fingers should be extended and your thumb should rest just below the trigger when you shoot the crossbow using this method you will activate the trigger by pressing up on it with your thumb hold the bow perpendicular to the ground when you first grab the bow do so while the bow is in a horizontal position the bow should line up vertically with the strings and the entire thing should face the ground at roughly a 90 degree angle 3 x research source a well made recurve bow will usually have a grip on it that naturally guides the and in place even so it can be a good idea to know how to place your hand on the bow correctly just in case the balance of the grip does not work for your strength and height or in case you must use a cheaper recurve bow grab the bow with your non dominant hand the grip should rest inside the pocket of your non dominant hand this pocket is the natural gap that lies in between your palm and your thumb check to see that your lifeline is straight up and down if you cannot find the pocket of your hand try to relax the muscles in your hand more oftentimes tense muscles can cause this pocket to disappear note that if you fail to grab the bow with this portion of your hand you may not have enough stability to control the bow as you draw it back to shoot ideally the force of your hand should be at the lateral center of the bow grip and just slightly below the vertical center of the grip the grip usually lies at the center of the bow if your bow does not have a grip built into it grab it near the center and adjust your hand placement accordingly until you can get a firm enough grip to prevent the bow from swaying as you hold it you may need to test your hold on the bow by drawing the string back the hand should feel comfortable and the center of your hand should come into full contact with the center of the bow grip there should also be no pressure or force on the wrist during a shot this is a good time to check that you have the right bow if you are drawing the string with your right hand you should buy a right handed bow and the arrow arrow rest should be on the left side of the bow vice versa if you draw with your left hand bend your fingers around the grip the thumb should rest on the back of the bow grip and the index finger should wrap around the front and barely brush against your thumb from the other side if at all ultimately the index finger and thumb must both feel firm without feeling tense the remaining three fingers of your hand should gently curl toward the front of the bow grip you may notice that the middle and ring fingers can wrap around the grip while the pinky curls and presses against the grip the important thing to remember is simply to prevent your fingers from getting stressed the position of your fist including the index middle ring and pinky fingers should move down diagonally at a 45 degree angle from the bow note that the force of the bow should be placed on the thumb and index finger these two fingers are the only ones that will really end up controlling to direction of the bow keep your hand relaxed yet steady the placement of your fingers should not change as you draw or release the bow also note that the tension should only exist in your hand and nowhere else in other words keep your wrist arm and shoulder relaxed also note that the left part of your palm should not be allowed to touch the actual grip part of the bow instead it should face downward toward the ground if the palm touches the bow you will be unable to turn the bow arm inward which can lead to a bad shot hold the bow at a 90 degree angle the entire bow should be perpendicular to the ground the stick portion of the bow should appear horizontal as well as perpendicular to your body and the strings should line up with the stick on a vertical plane the longbow varies from the recurve and compound bow in that the wrist grip needs to be positioned a bit lower in order to maintain adequate balance you will ultimately apply more pressure with the heel of your hand and the pivot point will be further away from the arrow bring the bow into contact with the ball of your thumb joint position the bow grip in your non dominant hand so that the primary point of contact lies roughly on the the base of your thumb more precisely the bow should rest just outside of the thumb joint at the fleshy part of your hand just below the pocket of your thumb the pocket refers to the portion of your hand in between your thumb and palm as long as your hand is relaxed you should easily find this natural space composed mostly of flesh unlike a recurve or compound bow the point of contact you have with a long bow should be at the lowest part of this pocket rather than at the center the force must ultimately rest on the heel of the hand and below the thumb joint so this should be where your primary point of contact is 4 x research source be careful as you grip your bow if your grip is too near the thumb you will have poor aim and will ultimately end up stressing your thumb joint if your grip is too near the palm the bow will be highly unstable curve your fingers around the bow grip you may need to play around with finger placement in order to find something both firm and comfortable but as with other bow types most of the control will come from the thumb and index finger the thumb should wrap around the back of the bow the knuckle may end up resting toward the inside edge of the grip but only slightly and not in a dramatic manner the index finger will usually wrap around the front of the bow and meet the thumb from the other side note however that you should only just barely allow these two fingers to meet if they are pressed together you are likely gripping the bow too tight or strangling it this can cause serious pain to your hand and it may also slow the flight of the arrow when you shoot the remaining three fingers should wrap around the front of the bow keep them relaxed and natural but firm the pinky finger can move around some and is not a crucial element of the grip but usually you will still want it to curve around the front of the bow keep the force in your hand the pressure should rest on the ball of your thumb as you shoot and the wrist should remain as straight as possible 5 x research source when you draw the bow string back your elbow will need to be level with your shoulder in order to maintain this balance in your hand your wrist should never be forced to flex during the process and you should keep as much pressure as possible out of your arm muscles

how to install a peep sight,in archery a peep sight often just called a peep is an aiming aid that s attached directly to the bowstring of a compound or recurve bow peeping through the sight while the bow is drawn helps you determine where your arrow will end up after having a friend help you mark the ideal spot for your peep reduce the tension on your bowstring with a bow press and start the process of serving in the peep that is using serving string to tie the peep in place after a fair bit of wrapping tying and finishing touches you ll be ready to use your peep to hit that elusive bull s eye,nock an arrow and draw the bow as normal with the bow pointed downward slip the nock at the back of the arrow over the bowstring grasp the rear of the arrow with with 3 fingers then pull back as you raise the bow 1 x research source it s more common to add a peep sight to a compound bow but you can also add one to a recurve bow in the same manner position yourself like you re aiming at a target straight ahead stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width and your body positioned perpendicular to your imagined target keep your elbows parallel to the ground as you draw the bowstring fully back to your typical reference point you might for instance draw back until your thumb brushes your cheek chin ear or nose focus your eyes on your imaginary target 2 x research source if you re having trouble envisioning an imaginary target go out on the range and aim at a real target have a friend mark the bowstring where it s level with your eye s pupil they need to stand at your side so that the drawn bow is between the two of you and the arrow is pointed perpendicular to your bodies ask them to imagine a straight line running from the bowstring to the pupil of your eye that s closest to it have them mark this spot on the bowstring with a permanent marker 3 x research source it s important to maintain your normal shooting position while the other person marks the location for the peep otherwise the peep won t be in the right spot when you are ready to shoot make sure your friend never stands anywhere near the arrow s potential flight path slowly lower the bow and reduce the tension on the bowstring after your friend marks the spot for the peep reduce full tension on your bow string with an allen wrench if possible insert an allen wrench into the appropriate slot at the tip of one bow arm make 2 full counterclockwise turns and repeat on the other bow arm this type of fine tuning is available with nearly all compound bows and some models of recurve bows 4 x research source check the owner s manual to confirm how to do this fine tuning for your particular bow model skip this step and move on to using a bow press if your bow does not permit this type of fine tuning loosen the bow string tension further by using a bow press a bow press is essentially a large clamp that squeezes the bow s arms in slightly in order to reduce the tension on the bowstring insert your bow horizontally into the press according to your press model s instructions then tighten the press often by turning a wheel until there is light slack on the bowstring you should be able to easily lift the string 1 in 2 5 cm with 2 fingers 5 x research source inserting a peep properly requires the use of a bow press while you can search online for examples of diy bow presses that may work for you it s likely a worthwhile investment to purchase a bow press alternatively see if a fellow archer or repair shop has a bow press you can use low end bow presses cost around 50 usd while high end models can sometimes cost around 500 ask knowledgeable archers if there are particular models they recommend or discourage separate the 2 intertwined strands of the bowstring at the marked spot modern bowstrings are made up of 2 intertwined strands which are usually different colors wedge the tip of a bowstring separator tool between the strands right where your friend put the marker spot remove the tool and use your fingers to keep the strands separated 6 x research source check at your local archery shop or do an online search for bowstring separator tool bowstring separator tools usually cost less than 10 usd and are less likely to damage the bowstring than diy options like a dull butter knife slide the peep between the strands with the notches aligned a modern peep is typically a small plastic tube that has a central channel running around its outer circumference as well as 2 notches that run nearly perpendicular to the central channel use one hand to keep the bowstring strands spread apart use your other hand to insert the peep between the strands so that they slide into the notches when you release tension on the strands 7 x research source there are other types of peeps some with subtle or even significant design differences so refer to the specific product instructions whenever installing any type of peep cut a length of serving string that s approximately 18 in 46 cm serving string is a thin synthetic thread designed specifically for archery equipment unroll the amount you need estimating more rather than less and cut it off with scissors 8 x research source pick up serving string at any archery supply store or online do not use other types of thread or fishing line they aren t made for this job wrap the line 4 times around just one of the bowstring threads then pull it tight start the wrap about 1 in 2 5 cm either above or below the peep s location leave about a 0 5 in 1 3 cm tail of line when you make the first wrap around the thread fold the tail down against the thread and wrap the line over its own tail and the thread 3 times 9 x research source pull the 4 wraps tight by pulling on the tail with a pair of needle nose pliers and pulling on the free end of the string with your fingers or better yet a second pair of needle nose pliers wrap the line 4 times around both threads then tighten the wraps again lift the tail of thread out of the way this time instead of wrapping over it after going around both threads of the bowstring 4 times pull the wraps tight with pliers again 10 x research source wrap 4 times pull and repeat until you re 0 25 in 0 64 cm or closer to the peep aim to get as close to the peep as you can while still being able to cinch both strands of the bowstring together with the wraps of string if you can make it all the way to the peep that s great but getting within 0 25 in 0 64 cm is sufficient to securely hold the peep in place 11 x research source run the string to the other side of the peep and make 2 tight wraps pull the string taut and run it past the peep and to the other side above the peep if you started wrapping below it or vice versa make one wrap around a single bowstring thread on this other side of the peep then make a single wrap around both bowstring threads and pull the wraps tight 12 x research source start the wraps on the second side so that they mirror those on the first side that is if the wraps got to within 0 125 in 0 32 cm of the peep on the first side make the first wrap on the second side starting at 0 125 in 0 32 cm from the peep keep wrapping and pulling until the wraps on both sides of the peep are equal as before make 4 wraps around both threads pull them tight with pliers and repeat you don t need to end up with the exact same number of wraps on both sides of the peep but aim for the wraps to cover the same length on the bowstring 13 x research source tie your preferred secure knot with the remaining length of string you can tie the free end of the string using several single or double overhand knots a whip finish knot or another type of secure knot that you re comfortable tying 14 x research source it s really just a matter of personal preference the knot should hold on its own but you ll also be adding some finishing touches to ensure that the wraps stay in place trim both free ends of the serving string to 0 125 in 0 32 cm in length use either sharp scissors or a razor blade for the job don t try to cut the free ends completely flush with the wraps of string instead leave very short stubs of free string at each end 15 x research source apply super glue to the serving string stubs for a quick seal there are 2 options here gluing the stubs or melting them and gluing is a bit easier work carefully so that you apply just a single drop right where each stub meets the wraps of string let the glue dry for the product s recommended drying time often around 1 2 minutes before proceeding 16 x research source try your best not to get any super glue on either the peep or the bowstring threads as it may impact your bow s performance a typical small squeeze bottle of super glue which you can get from a wide range of retail outlets is fine for this application melt the stubs with a lighter s flame for a nicer looking seal gluing the stubs gets the job done but melting them in place looks more professional carefully position the lighter so that the flame just barely laps at one of the stubs pull the lighter away once you see the synthetic material that makes up the stub start to deform wait 2 seconds then use your finger to squash the stub down against the wraps of string repeat with the other stub 17 x research source it s very easy to damage your bowstring threads by getting an open flame too close to them work very cautiously here because you ll likely have to replace your entire bowstring it you singe one of the threads release the tension and remove your bow from the bow press if you turned a wheel clockwise to tighten the press against your bow turn the wheel counterclockwise to free your bow from the press otherwise follow the specific product instructions for your model of bow press 18 x research source if you slightly lessened the tension on your bow string with an allen wrench before putting the bow into the press make sure to reverse the process after removing the bow from the press if for example you made 2 full counterclockwise turns at the end of each bow arm previously make 2 full clockwise turns of the allen wrench at the end of each bow arm now draw the bow using proper technique and confirm the location of the peep when you nock an arrow and draw the bow fully as normal you should be able to look straight through the opening in the peep sight if necessary you can make very minor adjustments to the peep s location by nudging it up or down a miniscule fraction of an inch centimeter 19 x research source if you followed every step along the way

how to measure draw length for a bow,draw length is a concept that has become especially relevant with the advent of compound bows unlike traditional bows compound bows are set to draw back only a certain distance however draw length will also determine arrow length and bow size more generally for the most efficient and precise shooting you need to measure the shooter and the bow to match,learn proper form for drawing a bow 1 x research source to get an accurate draw measurement the most important factor is knowing how you will be drawing the bow to shoot in practice if you have bad form posture or instruction your draw length could come out several inches off from where it needs to be a common issue with form is overstretching it feels somewhat intuitive to stretch your arms and shoulders back as far as you can thinking this will translate into more power however beyond a certain point you are not stretching in the direction of the arrow this creates extra slack length that does nothing for your shot generally you want your front arm outstretched and locked your back arm should draw the curve between the index finger and thumb to your jaw bone below the ear this anchoring point will give consistent shooting and proper placement for aiming 2 x research source use an uncut arrow to measure the draw 3 x research source this is typically a professional s go to method for beginners as it utilizes the archery trade association s calculation for draw length you will use a regular bow with the uncut arrow and the pro will be able to mark your draw length like on a ruler draw the bow and measure from nock point to pivot point plus 1 ¾ inches 4 x research source the nock point is where the arrow nestles on the string not the end of the arrow the pivot point is where the bow nestles into the curve between your index finger and thumb the 1 ¾ inches addition is the measure forward from the pivot point to the front of the bow s grip this is deemed the true draw length consult your local archery club or sales shop as a beginner typically this will be your best bet to get a professional s help in determining your appropriate draw length although the methodology may change from professional to professional they will have a method that has worked well in their experience this will also give you the chance to ask more questions and find out what to do if you feel the measurement turns out slightly off stand against a wall with your arms outstretched make sure the wall is bare behind you so as not to alter the measurement your arms should be parallel to the floor but not overly reached out to the side your body should be forming a t shape mark the wall to where your middle fingers extend have a friend place a small piece of painter s tape to avoid damaging the wall at the tip of each of your middle fingers measure your wingspan from tip to tip in inches with a tape measure calculate the distance between each piece of tape this is your wingspan you can now remove the tape from the wall divide the wingspan measurement by 2 5 5 x research source this is another tried and true method used by archers everywhere some places will use your height instead as there is a correlation between height and wingspan but since your arms are doing the work it is best to do this by wingspan use this measurement to buy or set your bow s draw length depending on the type of bow you are shooting with you will either select your recurve bow size by the draw length or adjust the compound bow s settings to match your draw 6 x research source have an idea of the size you need before going into the store this will save you time and effort when dealing with the salesperson you also need to research the draw weight that is appropriate for your age size and physical ability consult a pro to help you decide if you are unsure get an arrow that is longer than your arm use an uncut arrow or a specific measuring arrow with ruler markings on the side check at your local archery supply store or make your own this can help make calculating the distances a little easier in the long run place the notch of the arrow on your chest it should be just below the collarbone 7 x research source this aligns the arrow with your shoulders sockets to the left and right face your palms together with the arrow between your hands the arrow should be pointing away from you parallel to your arms do not arch your back to get extra distance mark where the tips of your middle fingers reach on the arrow and add 2 inches 5 1 cm 8 x research source similar to the archery trade association s calculation you will add 2 inches 5 1 cm on top of the measurement from the arrow although this method is not typically as accurate for professionals it s a good starting place for beginners or archers working solo,Sports-and-Fitness

how to test bow poundage,bow poundage usually called draw weight is the amount of force required to draw the bowstring back to a normal shooting position poundage means that this weight is measured in pounds but you could also use kilograms or ounces having the right draw weight is important for good bow and arrow performance especially if you re a competitor sometimes the weight needs adjustment if the string is too difficult or easy to draw back 1 x research source luckily checking the draw weight is easy you can either use a manual or digital scale to take a measurement after this you ll know if your bow has a good draw weight or needs some maintenance,slide the scale indicator back to the starting position a standard bow scale looks like a long tube with a hook on the end an indicator along the side of the tube shows the poundage of your draw if this isn t in the zero position when you start slide it back into the start position for an accurate measurement 2 x research source it s possible for the spring in the scale to wear out and give you an inaccurate measurement if your scale is starting to give inconsistent measurements then you probably need a replacement spring a professional at a bow shop should be able to replace it for you place your middle and index fingers on the scale finger rests on the front of the scale there are 2 finger rests that make a small t shape place your index finger on the top one and your middle finger on the bottom one then wrap your thumb and other fingers around the tube 3 x research source use the hand that you usually draw your bow with if you re right handed then hold it in your right hand make sure the numbers on the scale face you otherwise your hand might block the indicator 4 x research source hook the scale around the arrow nook on the string at the end of the bow scale where your fingers are there is a rounded hook loop this around the bowstring in the same place that you d put an arrow 5 x research source test to make sure the scale is attached a few times before you draw it back fully pull back a bit to make sure the hook doesn t come loose hold the bow up with your arm stretched out straight grab the bow handle with your free arm and lift it into your normal shooting position for most people this means that your lead arm should be straight and in line with your elbow hold the scale in position like it s an arrow 6 x research source don t point the bow at any people or things that could break if you let go of the scale you could shoot it like an arrow some professionals like to nock an arrow while they re measuring the poundage to mimic their draw length when they re actually shooting however if you re not experienced using a bow scale don t do this if you release the string accidentally you could shoot the arrow pull the string back smoothly until you reach your normal draw length draw the string as if you were getting ready to shoot an arrow continue until you reach your normal draw length for most people this is right around their ear hold it in position for a few seconds to take a measurement 7 x research source do not let go of the scale at any point if you feel like you re losing your grip then release the tension slowly let the tension off of the string smoothly don t simply let go of the bow or scale while you have the string drawn this could send the scale flying instead bring your drawing arm forward at an even pace until there s no more tension on the string 8 x research source check the indicator line on the bow scale to measure the poundage the indicator on the scale will measure the poundage of your draw check the number that it s pointing to and you ll know the poundage of your draw 9 x research source slide the indicator back to zero so you re ready for the next measurement you might want to check 2 or 3 times to confirm your first measurement set the scale to pounds if you have the option some digital scales can cycle between different units of measure look for a button labeled unit and press it until the scale says pounds as its unit of measure 10 x research source you can also use a different unit of measure if you d like always check the instructions on the scale you re using for the proper procedure some scales have on switches and others might simply activate when you press a button press the tare button to zero the scale on most digital scales the tare button sets the scale back to zero hit this before every measurement to make sure your scale gets an accurate measurement 11 x research source hang the scale on a secure mount on the ceiling you need to hang the scale from something strong that will stay in place while you pull the bow some people use a chain or secure ropes and others drill a hook directly into their ceiling this will all work as long as it can support enough weight loop the circular attachment on the scale into this mount 12 x research source many bows have a draw weight of over 60 lb 27 kg so you need a mount that can hold at least that much weight do not use a nail or screw in the ceiling to secure the scale these aren t strong enough and could pop out hook the scale around your bow string in the arrow section take your bow and place it into the scale hook in the same place you d nock and arrow make sure the string is secure before trying to pull it 13 x research source pull the bow all the way down smoothly grab the bow firmly with one hand on either side of the handle then pull it down with firm pressure to measure its weight stop when the scale stops increasing which indicates that you ve hit the max draw weight 14 x research source an electric scale automatically measures the max draw weight on the string so even if you pull it too far this won t make a difference raise the bow back up with steady pressure remember that the bow is under tension so don t let it go or it ll shoot up raise the blow smoothly to release the tension when you re back in the starting position you can let it go or take it off the hook 15 x research source check the measurement on the scale the scale saves and displays the last measurement it took check the screen to see the poundage of your bow 16 x research source you can confirm your measurement by measuring a few more times remember to hit tare to set it back to zero regardless of the bow s poundage if you can t pull it back to your full draw comfortably then it s too heavy and needs adjustment 17 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to store archery bows,getting a cool new bow is a lot of fun but figuring out what to do with it afterward can be confusing if you re tempted to lean it in a corner of your room you risk causing permanent damage to it fortunately storing a bow really isn t that difficult when you have the right case or mount be sure to store your bow properly whether you re at home or at a shooting range you paid good money for it so make it last as long as possible by storing it properly,choose a storage option that is large enough to hold your bow to determine what storage size your bow needs measure it from end to end also measure its width keep in mind that cases and holsters come in a variety of different sizes the type of bow you have will also affect what case size you have to get 1 x research source if you have a compound bow you won t be able to remove its string make sure the case or mount you get fits the shape of your bow as well as its length recurve bows can be left strung or be unstrung before storage if you have a recurve bow its ends or limbs curve away from you when it s unstrung so keep that in mind when choosing a storage method takedown recurve bows are always unstrung before they are stored in addition you can separate one into multiple pieces which means you can get a more compact mount or case buy a soft case for general transportation and storage soft cases are made from damage resistant fabric they come in a variety of shapes and sizes so you can find a suitable one no matter what kind of bow you have soft cases are the best option when you re looking for something decent and reasonably priced that you can use every day most of them also have side pouches that give you plenty of room to store arrows and accessories 2 x research source basic soft cases are available for as little as 10 to 20 usd one of the main benefits of soft cases is that you can use them to carry your bow as well as store it long term at home although soft cases hold up well outdoors they aren t damage proof the fabric will eventually start to fray they don t last as long as hard cases get a hard case if your bow needs additional protection hard cases are made of plastic so they are more damage resistant than other types if you set something on top of the case you won t have to worry about it damaging your bow hard cases also work well if you take your bow into harsh outdoor conditions like if you hunt most of them also are big enough for you to store arrows and accessories with your bow 3 x research source some basic hard cases cost 25 to 30 many others cost double or triple that a hard case comes in handy when you re short on room for example if you live in a small apartment pack your bow into a full car or even take it on a plane the extra support helps a lot use an archery backpack if you want more portability archery backpacks are special padded backpacks designed specifically to carry bows although they can also be used for storage if you have a backpack you could hang it up or even rest it in a safe spot inside your home backpacks are much softer than cases so you have to be careful to avoid crushing your bow however if you need a way to store your bow while you re on the go a backpack could be your best option 4 x research source some backpacks cost as little as 40 to 50 there are also high end ones that cost over 100 backpacks are best for hunters or people who go on cross country trips you may not be able to lug around a case so a backpack is the only way to protect your bow backpacks work best for recurve bows particularly ones that come apart some backpacks can hold an assembled bow use a bow stand to keep your bow off the ground bow stands are similar to camera tripods you set the bow stand on the floor then mount the bow on top of it it is a good way to keep your bow safe for both short and long term storage however it leaves your bow out in the open so you could still potentially damage it if you re not careful 5 x research source bow stands are very inexpensive you can get a basic one for 7 to 12 bow stands are mainly used to store stringed bows standing the bow on the ground could deform it it can be used for unstrung bows too bow stands are small and cheap plus you can take yours with you when you go out to shoot install wall pegs or mounts for a way to hang your bow the simplest way to mount a bow is by getting a pair of pegs and hammering them into a wall rest the bow on top of the pegs so it s safe but readily accessible for a more decorative option invest in a bow rack racks also have pegs that safely prop up your bow 6 x research source pegs and racks cost around 14 to 60 hanging pegs have to be spaced evenly apart so each one supports half of the bow s weight otherwise they could warp its structure wall hangers are only useful at home you will still have to get a separate carrying case for when you take your bow outdoors get a mount or case with extra storage if you have accessories some extra gear you might store includes arrows spare string an arm guard gloves and string wax if you plan on carrying extra make sure you have room for it the extra gear can often be stored with your bow and many cases have side pockets you can take advantage of to keep everything organized more basic storage systems like stands and mounts won t have this luxury 7 x research source be careful when using a very compact case since you might not have room to store everything you wish to keep with your bow some accessories like sights and silencers come in a storage tube if you have accessories in storage tubes determine if you can include the tubes in your bow s case another option is to carry accessories separately from your bow buy separate carriers as needed for example get an arrow tube to carry arrows or a tacklebox to carry tools remove the string if you have a wooden bow wooden recurve bows deform when you leave them stringed for long periods of time to prevent this attach an accessory called a bow stringer to the bow s ends pull it down to the floor and hold it down with both of your feet lift the bow until the string is slack then untie it to detach it from your bow 8 x research source a recurve bow is a traditional bow that has a string and no extra parts one way to tell apart recurve bows is by looking at the ends they will curve away from you when the bow is unstrung compound bows are made of aluminum or carbon and have pulleys that hold the string in place with this kind of bow you never have to remove the string unless you re replacing it plenty of modern recurve bows are made of synthetic material they are stronger than wooden bows so you don t really have to remove the string unless you re storing the bow long term like for over a month pull apart takedown recurve bows for easier storage check the manufacturer s instructions for specific information about how the bow comes apart generally you have to loosen the string first using a bow stringer then untie the string to store it separately finally use an allen key or a wrench to remove the bolts holding the limbs together 9 x research source takedown recurve bows are the only kind meant to be broken down into smaller pieces if you have one you can pull it apart for easier storage you don t have to take apart your bow if you re keeping it in a large case or mount even if you have a takedown recurve bow leaving it whole is fine clean the bow by wiping it with a microfiber cloth wipe down each piece including the string to remove any debris left on the bow to remove stubborn debris you could apply an automotive polishing compound rub it over the bow with a microfiber cloth clean any accessories you plan on storing with the bow too 10 x research source you should do this every time you finish using your bow that way it is less likely to get damaged in storage it will also ensure your bow lasts longer automotive polish is also great for getting rid of things like mildew that could grow out of hand while your bow is stored make sure your bow is completely clean and dry polish the bowstring with a stick of bowstring wax peel back the wrapping on the wax stick then press it against the string rub it gently along the entire string on both ends until it is well coated then use your fingers to massage the wax deeper into the string when you re done you shouldn t be able to see any visible wax left on the string 11 x research source wax prevents the string from fraying or absorbing moisture while it s in storage to make your string last wax it about once every 2 weeks if it starts to feel rough or dry give it a fresh coat of wax store the bow parts inside the pockets if you re using a case store the bow according to the kind of storage unit you have generally cases have a big spot in the middle where you rest the bow on its side place the accessories such as arrows or signs in separate side pockets 12 x research source keep the main parts of the bow together if you have a takedown bow the bow s limbs and string all fit together some cases have separate slots for each part accessories usually can be stored inside the case many of them come with individual storage tubes or you can buy extra storage tubes if you wish to use them hang the bow so it s off the ground if you have a mount for stand type mounts set the bow so its outer edge is up against the mount make sure the bow is off of the ground so it doesn t get damaged for hanging mounts slide the bow on top of the mount s pegs the bow will rest on top of the pegs and won t ever come close to the ground 13 x research source no matter what kind of bow you have you can hang it they all hang the same way hanging is a good option if you use your bow frequently since you can just pull it off the wall and go hanging a bow successfully is all about balancing its weight hanging pegs have to be the same distance from the bow s ends so its shape doesn t change in storage accessories usually have to be stored separately from the bow you can keep them in individual storage tubes or in a bow case pick a cool spot where the temperature is stable for example move the bow to the back of a dark closet or put it on a stable shelf you could also leave it out in a room that stays consistent throughout the day especially if you re hanging or mounting it try to avoid extreme temperatures or any locations where the temperature could change a lot over time 14 x trustworthy source state of michigan official website for the state of michigan go to source for example keep your bow away from heaters and air conditioners the temperature change could damage it even when it s in a case never leave your bow in a hot car the heat will cause your bow to warp over time keep the bow away from moisture and humidity for safety it s important to store your bow in a climate controlled area you shouldn t leave it in a garage for instance or a damp basement move it away from water sources such as leaky pipes or air conditioners make sure it won t get wet while it s in storage 15 x trustworthy source state of michigan official website for the state of michigan go to source water is very bad for wooden bows but it will also ruin synthetic ones it causes the bow to warp and could cause mildew to grow on it choose a spot where the bow won t get stepped on this can be a big problem if you re keeping your bow in a soft case or backpack you could easily crush the bow just by setting something heavy on top of it try to keep the bow in an area where it won t get damaged such as on an empty shelf in a closet if you put it up high make sure it can t be knocked down 16 x research source if you re hanging or mounting your bow make sure that it is secure on its storage unit otherwise it could be knocked to the floor when you re passing by be careful when carrying your bow in a car on an airplane or in another crowded spot it could easily get crushed it s best to keep the bow in a hard case when it will be in tight quarters pick a spot where children can t reach the bow it s better to put the bow up high to prevent it from getting damaged move the bow in its case up onto a high shelf or hang it on a wall mount store the arrows separately as well doing this will ensure that your home is safe if you have pets put the bow up for safekeeping as well 17 x research

how to increase draw weight on a bow,the draw weight on a compound bow is the amount of force it takes to pull it back and it s super important to find the right balance if your draw weight is too light your arrow may not have as much force and could fall short of its target you can increase your draw weight at home in just a few minutes by using an allen wrench since every brand is slightly different always read the owner s manual before you start working on your bow so you can adjust your draw weight safely,read your owner s manual before you start adjusting your draw weight it s important to read through your bow s manual to learn about its specific features every compound bow is slightly different and some may have different locking mechanisms than others 1 x research source loosen the limb locking screws with an allen wrench bow limbs are the flexible planks at the top and the bottom of the bow that are attached to the riser the limb locking screws hold your limb bolts in place and they re usually located just below the top limb or right above the bottom limb use an allen wrench to turn them counterclockwise 4 to 5 times to loosen them 2 x research source your bow can have anywhere from 1 to 4 limb locking screws or none at all check your owner s manual to find out where they are turn the limb bolts clockwise to tighten them by 2 pounds 0 91 kg the limb bolts are the bolts that connect the bow s arm to the riser and they usually look like large circular knobs put an allen wrench into 1 of the bolts and turn it clockwise to tighten it then do the same to the other one make sure you turn them both the same amount of turns so that your bow is even 3 x research source if you want to increase your draw weight to the maximum it can go keep turning your bolts until they re tight tighten the limb locking screws with your allen wrench move your allen wrench back to the limb locking screws that you loosened at the beginning and turn them clockwise until they re all tight make sure you remember to lock them each time you adjust your draw weight so that your bow stays intact 4 x research source if you don t lock your limb locking screws your bow will be loose and could get damaged test your new draw weight by nocking an arrow in your bow it s important to test your new draw weight to see if it s the right weight for you point your bow and arrow at a target and nock the arrow into place shoot the arrow to see how well you do with your aim and if it s a comfortable weight for you 5 x research source start with the average draw weight for your age group although the starting draw weight for your age group might be too light it s always best to start lower and move upwards so you don t injure yourself or damage your bow 6 x research source children usually need a draw weight of 20 to 35 pounds 9 1 to 15 9 kg women usually need a draw weight of 35 to 45 pounds 16 to 20 kg men usually need a draw weight of 55 to 65 pounds 25 to 29 kg measure your draw length to find the right weight for you your draw length is how wide your arms can stretch from fingertip to fingertip hold your arms out at shoulder level as wide as they can go then measure from one hand to the other then divide that number by 2 5 to get your draw length if you have a longer than average draw length you may need to lower your draw weight 7 x research source the average draw length depends on your height for men it s usually around 28 25 inches 71 8 cm and for women it s around 25 5 inches 65 cm once you figure out your draw length you can take your bow to a professional to get it adjusted it s a little harder than calibrating the weight so you shouldn t try to do it at home choose more weight if you re going hunting a heavier draw weight will allow your arrow to fly further and hit harder if you ll be using your bow for hunting try to increase your draw weight as much as you can for a harder hit 8 x research source shoot arrows at a target about 6 feet 1 8 m away if you want to increase the amount of weight you can draw you need to shoot a lot of arrows in a quick succession try setting up a target that isn t too far away and shooting arrows at it to build up your strength 9 x research source this is the best way to work out all the muscles that you use for shooting arrows pull your bow and hold it at full draw for 30 seconds if you don t have an area to shoot at you can instead just practice drawing an empty bow and holding it do this 5 to 10 times per day to strengthen your arm shoulder and core muscles 10 x research source engage your shoulder as you pull your bow back although it can be tempting to use only your bicep to pull back your arrow try to engage your shoulder and back muscles as well this will help you take on more weight since your shoulder and back muscles are larger than your arms 11 x research source if you re just starting out with archery have someone experienced watch your form as you draw back so you can see if you re doing it correctly exercise your core to strengthen it although it might seem like draw weight is only dependent on arm strength your core muscles have a lot to do with it also try doing sit ups crunches and planks 2 to 3 times per week to build up your abs so you can hold more weight 12 x research source to do sit ups lay flat on your back with your knees bent upwards use your abs to pull your chest up to your knees without picking your feet up off the ground you can do this 10 to 20 times depending on how hard it is for you to do crunches lay flat on your back again with your knees bent upwards this time use your abs to lift your back off the ground but don t go all the way up to your knees repeat this 20 to 25 times for a plank position push yourself up on your hands and feet while keeping your body in a straight line hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds at a time,Sports-and-Fitness

how to bowl,bowling is both a fun way to spend time with friends and a serious competitive sport whether you want to know how to be a casual bowler or how to advance your bowling skills you ve come to the right place,understand the bowling lane before you begin to bowl you have to understand the function of the bowling lane a bowling lane is 60 feet 18 3 m long from the foul line the line closest to the bowler to the head pin the pin closest to the bowler there are gutters on either side of the bowling lane if a ball veers off the lane it goes into the gutters and is out of play 1 x research source the approach area is 15 feet 4 6 m long and ends at the foul line the bowler cannot overstep the foul line during their approach or their shot won t count if a ball goes into the gutters and then bounces out and hits the pins it won t count understand the bowling pins ten pins are arranged at the end of the bowling lane at the beginning of every frame they are arranged in a triangle formation with the point of the triangle facing the bowler there is one pin in the first row which is the head pin two pins in the second row three in the third and four in the fourth 2 x research source the locations of the pins are assigned numbers 1 10 the pins in the back row have the numbers 7 10 the pins in the row above the back row are numbered 4 6 the pins in the second row are numbered 2 3 and the head pin is pin 1 all pins will earn the bowler one point if they are hit the numbers are based on location not value learn the lingo before you can call yourself a true bowler you should be aware of a few different bowling terms knowing these terms will also make it much easier for you to understand the rules here they are 3 x research source a strike is when you knock down all the pins with the ball on your first try a spare is when you knock down all the pins on your second try a split is when the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin the pin closest to you but leaves two or more pins that are non adjacent it s tough to hit a spare in this situation especially if you have a 7 10 split which is the hardest split to hit a turkey is three strikes in a row if any pins remain after the bowler s turn it s called an open frame understand how a game of bowling works one bowling game consists of 10 frames each frame is equal to one turn for the bowler the bowler s objective is to knock down as many pins as possible in a frame ideally all of them 4 x research source a bowler can roll the ball twice in each frame provided that they do not hit a strike a bowler gets an extra turn on the tenth frame if they knock down all the pins on the first turn learn the scoring if a bowler has an open frame then they simply get credit for the number of pins they knocked down if a bowler knocked down 6 pins after two turns they simply get two turns however if a bowler hits a spare or a strike the rules get slightly more complicated 5 x research source if a bowler hits a spare then they should place a slash mark on their score sheet after their next turn they will receive 10 points plus the number of pins they knock down with that turn so if they knock down 3 pins after their first turn then they will get 13 points before their second turn if they then knock down 2 pins in their second turn they get a total of 15 points for that round if a bowler hits a strike they should record an x on their scoresheet the strike will earn the bowler ten points plus the number of pins knocked down on the player s next two turns in the following round the most a bowler can score in one game is 300 points this represents 12 strikes in a row or 120 pins that were knocked down in 12 frames a perfect game has 12 strikes and not ten because if the bowler gets a strike on the last frame then they can take two more turns if those two turns are also strikes they will have 300 points if a player rolls a spare in the last frame then they can take one more turn find a bowling alley go online to find a local bowling alley that suits your needs try to find a place that offers bowling lessons or has beginner bowling leagues if you want to go bowling with friends find a place that s rated for having a fun environment and maybe some food and snacks as well go to the bowling alley you ve chosen talk to the fellow bowlers and staff and see if you can even join a game alternately you can go to an alley with a group of friends if you ask a crowd if you can join their game make sure it isn t too competitive you may even make new friends at the alley get some bowling shoes if you re a beginner you can just rent shoes at the alley if you want to kick up your game you can buy a pair of your own shoes street shoes won t work for bowling because they ll either make you stick to the floor instead of sliding naturally or they ll make you slip too much and injure yourself 6 x research source if you don t wear bowling shoes you can also damage or leave scuff marks on the alley floor rent a pair of shoes unless you want to get in trouble before you even start bowling don t forget to wear socks or bring socks to the alley some alleys sell socks but they will be expensive choose the right ball before you can begin to bowl you need to find a ball that is the right weight for you and which is the right size for your fingers the balls will be labeled based on their weight so a ball with 8 written on it will weigh 8 pounds here s how to find a ball of the right size and weight 7 x research source weight a 14 16 lb ball would work for most adults with bigger hands and a 10 14 lb ball would work for most adults with smaller hands generally it s better to have a ball that is a little heavier because it will help you gain momentum a general rule is that a ball should weigh 10 as much as your body so if you weigh 140 pounds you should bowl with a 14 lb ball size of the thumb hole your thumb should fit snugly into the single thumb hole you should be able to take it out of the hole without it snagging or getting stuck but the hole shouldn t be so large that you have to squeeze your thumb in the hole to hang on size of the middle finger holes once you ve inserted your thumb you should lay your middle and ring finger across the other two holes if the span is correct your two fingers should easily and comfortably lay over the two holes so the middle joint lines up with the side of the hole closest to your thumb curl your two fingers into the holes to make sure they fit snugly in the hole like your thumb find your bowling lane once you ve signed up at the alley and put on your shoes you will be directed to a bowling lane if you get to choose your lane pick a lane that is away from loud or noisy people but it s your choice you may be able to bowl better if you re surrounded by other bowlers hold the ball correctly first pick up your ball and head to the right spot in front of the bowling lane place your middle and ring finger in the top 2 holes and place your thumb into the bottom hole 8 x research source hold the ball slightly to your side with your bowling hand underneath the ball and your other hand resting on the bottom side of the ball for extra support keep your thumb on top of the ball at 10 00 position if you re right handed use the 2 00 position if you re a lefty approach the foul line the standard approach consists of standing with your back straight your shoulders centered squarely towards your target and your knees slightly bent your ball arm should hand straight down by your side your back should be tilted slightly forward 9 x research source your feet should be slightly apart and your slide foot should be placed slightly in front of the other foot your slide foot will be the opposite of the hand you use to bowl a right handed bowler will slide with their left foot work on aiming the ball your bowling lane should have a series of dots 7 feet 2 1 m down the lane and black arrows about fifteen feet down the lane if you re a beginning bowler you should aim to roll the ball in the center of these marks once you develop your bowling skills you can aim to the left or the right of the marks when you hook the ball even if you aim your ball through the center of the marks you may not be able to hit the pins because the ball can slow down or roll off toward the gutters just notice where the ball rolls when you do and don t bowl a solid frame and adjust your aim accordingly focus on aiming at the marks not the pins release the ball maintain a straight forward non twisting approach of your body as your ball and hand position should be held relatively the same underneath and behind the ball during the swing swing your ball arm smoothly back and then forward to release the ball release the ball when your arm has moved as far forward as it can go when released properly your thumb should come out first followed by the fingers this should help get rotation on the ball which should help the ball hook and carry once it gets down the lane keep your eye on the target you re aiming towards as you release the ball if you look down at your feet or the ball you will lose balance and won t be able to aim your ball correctly wipe your hands after your turn is over make sure your hands are completely dry before you pick up the ball to start bowl each time use a cloth to wipe your hands or at least wipe your hands on your pants if you don t have one if your hands are still sweaty the ball can slip out of your hands you can also use rosin which can be found in most pro bowling shops to make your fingers and thumb slightly tacky and less slippery keep score throughout the game most bowling alleys will have a computer near the sitting area that allows you to keep score if an alley doesn t have a computer then you will be given a score sheet to record your scores either way the process is the same here s how to keep score the area in the upper left of each frame is to record the first ball and the box to the left is for the second ball and if you have a strike a strike is marked with a x and a spare with a finish close to the foul line the distance between the delivery line and you should be of about 6 inches if you want to have an optimal release this means that the ball is lofted a small distance over the foul line before it makes contact with the lane thus the ball gets further down the lane and it preserves energy when hitting the pins finishing too far from the foul line means you ll have to move closer to it when you start in the stance 10 x research source remember that a strike is 10 plus the next two balls whereas a spare is 10 plus the next ball if you strike in the first ball in the 10th frame you get two more balls to determine your final score 300 is the highest score you can get watch bowling on tv carefully observe the professionals and see what techniques they use you can also watch video clips of expert bowlers online try to imitate the bowler s stances in your own home just remember that you re watching experts and that your bowling technique will be much simpler than theirs ask for advice if you want to really improve your game seek out help from other more advanced bowlers and from coaches it will always help to have a critical eye watching you and you will gain new insight join a bowling league this is a great way to keep up a regular practice and to make new friends read carefully and follow all the specific rules that are posted at the alley while on the lanes wear only bowling shoes don t start bowling until the pin setting machine has finished its cycle allow the bowler in an adjacent lane to play first if you both approach the runway at the same time otherwise the player who arrives first goes first 11 x research source don t step or go beyond the foul line even in casual play bowling is a sport so play fair 12 x research source if you cross the foul line you also risk slipping and other personal injury the ball should be bowled down the lane avoid any throwing or tossing of the ball as it may damage the lane don t play your game on another lane you should have enough space on your own 13 x research source always ask for permission first when using someone else s ball avoid distracting other players while they are bowling check your language and limit swearing as much as you can be ready when it s your turn to bowl try to keep the score accurate almost all alleys have now automated score keeping,Sports-and-Fitness
how to curve a bowling ball,you have the straight shot down and now it s time to look like the pros learning to throw a curve bowling ball takes a lot of time and practice but the effort pays off with the newfound confidence you will have after mastering this skill and improving your bowling score,start with the right stance and grip you want to be several inches from the foul line and preferably at least four steps away from your release some people take longer and that s fine but at least four steps is ideal line your feet up with the arrow on the lane you are aiming for which will depend on how hefty your curve is if you have your own ball you probably know how to grip it however if you re working with a house ball you may need to adjust your style house balls generally have knuckle grips you want your fingers and especially thumb to come out swiftly so don t jam them in there hold the ball so it aligns straight with your wrist hand positions are covered later on in this article it s more important during your swing than before always focus on the arrow on the lane that you want to hit never focus on the pin you are aiming for it is a lot easier to hit a mark that is ten feet in front of you than one that fifty the arrow you want to hit will vary on lane conditions wet vs dry to change the aim it is easier to change where you stand at the start than to change the arrow if you are missing to the left move your starting point to the left and vice versa it sounds counter intuitive but if you move to the left and hit the same arrow the ball will go farther right at the beginning before swinging to left there are dots on the floor to help you adjust moving your feet over just one board can be the difference between a strike and the dreaded 7 10 split start your approach like you would a straight shot your approach is the same as any standard shot the change is in your follow through and mostly in your hand bring the ball back into the swing position while keeping your palm behind the ball just as you normally do be sure to keep your wrist strong if you carry too much of the weight on your wrist or twist it back and forth you could hurt yourself or at the very least wear yourself down before your frames are up release the ball at the bottom of your swing pulling your thumb out before your fingers the idea behind the hook is at the very end your fingers are the only thing containing the ball and they spin it as it releases hence why your thumb needs to get out of the way here are a few hand position options 1 x research source the standard way to hook the ball is to place your two fingers and thumb in the three holes as normal in other words change nothing some people choose to not put their thumb in the ball at all and instead sort of cup the ball on their palm and or wrist as they swing the ball back and release it in the follow through and yet a few choose to only place one finger the index finger in the slot and palm the ball spinning in the same motion on the release however you risk the ball turning in your grip and that can lead to sprained wrists and fingers rotate your fingers up along the outside of the ball as you release directing the ball s spin with your fingers continue moving your hand up on your swing to direct the ball down the lane finishing in a handshake position ideally you want to go from a 4 o clock position to a 7 o clock position the ball should be totally out of your hands by the seven o clock position and your arm should follow through to the 12 o clock position with your hand up by your ear all while your eyes are lock on the arrow you are trying to hit try hard not to subconsciously decelerate your swing in an effort to concentrate on and nail your hook the same power is still needed or if you do account for the differential when you resume your normal throw the hook could be very different learn to control the degree of your curve by varying the ball s position and timing your release to increase the degree of the curve release your fingers from the ball more rapidly your counterclockwise motion could also be more or less drastic 2 x research source with a little practice you will know if you ve thrown a good ball or not by how close the arrow you are if you re not getting it isolate the variables and experiment with each one alone try starting from a different start spot try switching up your footwork heck experiment with different balls it s possible that your wrist and hand positioning is just fine and there s another element that s mixing it up use a tennis ball to practice a great way to practice your hook shot without having to make an embarrassing trip to the bowling alley is to practice with a tennis ball it ll go straight when you throw it but when it hits the bounce it ll veer off to the side if you re doing it right of course 3 x research source another option is a pool ball but the damage potential of nearby objects is a bit more substantial use a bowling ball that is a few pounds lighter than the ball you would normally use as you re learning a lighter ball allows you to focus on learning the new throwing technique while you definitely want to get up to your normal ball sooner rather than later the lighter ball can help you concentrate on what your hands should be doing just don t get too used to it think of it like spiraling a football only upside down if you have experience spiraling a football it s the same general principle just under handed your fingers move along the side of the ball in much the same way just think of throwing a football underhanded trying to maintain the same spin it starts cupped in your hand and the last point of contact is with the tips of your fingers as it spins off if you re using a house ball know that it could be very difficult those balls at the bowling alley are meant for straight shots hooking them could require different more outrageous methodology to get the same natural hook effect so if you don t have your own don t stress it could be your equipment the general rule of thumb is that you choose a ball that s 10 of your body weight if you re 160 pounds choose a 16 pound ball 4 x research source that is if you re of normal health and have no reason why a lighter ball would be more down your bowling alley get a ball with a fingertip grip certain balls most house balls come with knuckle grip where the holes go down to your second knuckle but a fingertip grip is much more conducive to throwing a hooked ball since your thumb and fingers have to come out the actions are a lot swifter and smoother 5 x research source get your own ball with a urethane or resin coating a urethane coverstock on your bowling ball will make your hook shot so much easier they don t absorb oil from the lane and they provide way more friction than your standard plastic ball the house ball those two things combined set that hook up for success 6 x research source a resin coating can actually dig into the oil in the lane upping the chance that you hit exactly where you re aiming for but they re quite an investment and only for the most serious of bowlers if you re considering getting your own ball ask about rg ratings and coverstock a ball with a high differential of rg rating will create a really sharp hook 7 x research source however you could have a ball with a low differential so long as it has a matte finish coverstock to combat lane oil if you re dealing with a dry lane at your home alley that is consider a stiff or pearl coverstock so many options when in doubt explain your situation to the assistant as long as you give them all your variables and what you d like to do they can find the perfect ball for you don t choose a ball drilled to your fingers and with your axis point until you have your hook down as you get better at it your hook changes so wait it out you want a ball that s all your own when you re at your peak,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hook a bowling ball,are you a beginner looking to take that next step and improve your bowling game if you want to hook a bowling ball then all you need is to master the proper grip and technique and to follow through oh and you need some time and patience too soon enough your friends will be bowled over by your amazing skills,visualize the line you ll take across the lane depending on the lanes you bowl on this can vary greatly but let s focus on a typical house condition most of the oil is on the inside leaving roughly 8 10 boards of relatively dry lane to be used these boards can be both friend and enemy to you depending on the amount of oil and the way your ball reacts to different lane conditions you will want to line up your feet slightly to the left hand side of the lane once you get more familiar with your hook you can adjust your set up as necessary starting with your right foot on the middle dot on the approach is a good way to test how much the lanes are hooking it is important to keep your feet closely together to maintain alignment stand with your heels several inches from the foul line take the amount of steps in your approach away from the lane to determine your starting position if you have a 4 step approach take 4 steps etc you then want to aim to throw your ball at one of the arrows on the lane the easiest way to aim is to use the arrow markings or the dots that are just before the arrows on the lane for this tutorial you should start off aiming somewhere around the second arrow on the right allowing the ball to roll over this arrow move out to only a few boards from the gutter and then hook from the dry spot of the lane about 38 to 40 feet down on a house shot all the way back to the 1 3 pocket for a left hander this would be the 2nd arrow on the left and the ball would hook to the 1 2 pocket make the swing a 4 step approach is recommended though you can use as little as 1 step and as many as 8 though most steps over 4 are basically just timing steps where your ball doesn t move for a 4 step approach push off the ball on your first step stepping with your right foot first for right handed players have the ball be parallel to your ankle at the 2nd step and start to bend at your knees be at the top of your backswing by your third step bring the ball back through and release by the end of your slide with 5 steps it s basically the same thing only you ll start with your left foot instead and the ball won t move for that first step keep your arm completely straight the entire way through your swing having your arm tucked too far behind you or held too far away from your body will cause a bad angle when you release the ball it s easiest to keep your arm straight if you adjust your push away there are many different styles like bending at the waist a la walter ray williams jr or wes malott or opening your shoulders a la tommy jones or chris barnes when you bring your arm up for the backswing but sticking to the basics is a good idea when first learning how to do this remember you want the ball to hook when it gets to the dry area at the back of the lane but until it gets there the ball should be traveling a relatively straight path varying only a few boards at most again everyone has a different style and you can adjust this as you feel comfortable time your release as you begin to drop the ball out of the backswing make sure that your palm is directly underneath the ball facing upwards now as the ball starts to approach your ankle you want to rotate the ball so that when you release your hand it is on the side of the ball and slightly under it just as if you were holding a football to throw an underhand spiral then follow through as though you were going to be shaking hands with the pins 1 x research source a good way to practice this technique is to actually throw an underhand spiral with a football similar physics are involved you can also practice with a tennis ball if you get it right it ll go straight and then bounce drastically to the side follow through just as important as the release itself is following through with your arm after you let go of the ball after release it is important to follow through outward onto the lane not upward your fingers will create the upward lift without you having to lift upward on the ball 2 x research source an easy way to remember this is the old espn advert roll the ball then answer the phone though hopefully you have better form than the guy in that commercial and remember fluidity here is essential don t do the hand shake pause slightly and then do the follow through it must all be one smooth motion a good follow through is crucial to maintaining consistent ball speed and accuracy make the necessary adjustments once you are comfortable with your release and can execute it properly on a consistent basis you can learn to adjust your footwork in tandem with your release on a house pattern you want to move the direction you are missing for a right hander if your ball hits high to the left of the headpin then try moving your feet a couple of boards to the left and keeping your target on the lane the same as before if you hit the pocket light to the right of the 3 pin try moving your feet a couple of boards to the right and keep your target the same it is important to move your target on the lane when you move your feet otherwise you may end up playing very weird angles once you become more advanced and start playing on more challenging sport lane conditions the left and right moves become more complicated and sometimes speed and hand adjustments are required get the right equipment no matter what you do if the bowling ball can t catch any friction on the lanes it s not going to hook generally you need a ball made of reactive resin or better e g particle load or newer epoxy resin cover stocks for anything but the driest of lanes these are very easy to find and can be bought at relatively little expense though resin is more expensive than urethane cover stock and will be an investment in your game 3 x research source check out your alley how oily are the lanes though most bowling centers do offer house balls they are generally plastic polyester and won t hook very much though they are good for most spares since they will travel very straight having your own plastic ball for spares spare ball and a resin ball for strikes and some spares spare ball is a good idea for any level of bowler as house balls don t usually fit your hand perfectly and won t carry pins very well use the proper grip when you re getting your ball custom fitted to your hand you want to know how you hold the ball your point of axis and how your grip lies grip the ball with the two middle fingers the middle and ring fingers of your dominant hand i e the hand you write with and place your thumb the whole way into the thumb hole 4 x research source there are 2 main types of grips conventional the middle and ring fingers are inserted up to the second knuckle this is seen in most house balls fingertip grip the same fingers are inserted only up to the first knuckle fingertip grips will give you more revs than a conventional grip and are easier to hook a new thing out these days in the bowling community are vacu grips these grips will expand and contract to your finger width this helps if you are going to bowl a lot you will find that most of the pros use a fingertip grip as it allows you to get your thumb out of the ball first allowing you to lift with your fingers creating revs on the ball have your ball s drilled correctly this is a personal thing depending on how and where you bowl so you will need to talk to your local pro shop operator for advice on this one the drilling for the ball is very important if not crucial so make sure the drilling is appropriate for the conditions you bowl on and your own physical limitations obviously it is critical that your own ball is fitted to your hand but if you purchase a ball the pro shop operator will do this as part of the cost of the drilling talk to your pro shop guy about your wants he may be able to recommend things you don t realize you need maybe a fingertip grip a lower or higher rp differential lower differential hooks on pearl or matte coverstock higher on resin or even a different ball or different weight completely,Sports-and-Fitness
how to bowl a strike,do you want to roll turkeys three strikes in a row or string strikes like the pros it is certainly within the physical capabilities of most people all you need is to find your proper starting position develop a fundamentally solid and repeating swing then practice if you are naturally athletic and reasonably proficient at repeating motions much practice may even be required watch out though bowling is addictive,determine whether you will be using a house ball or will be buying your own most people start with a house ball and house shoes as this is the cheapest option there are normally many house balls to choose from and these are supplied free of charge by the bowling alley shoes may be rented for one price which covers your entire bowling session the other option is get your own ball and have it custom fitted to your hand for your individual swing and release the fitting and drilling can often be accomplished on the spot if the resident pro is in the bowling center at the time the pro will be able to advise you on the best ball composition and weight for your skill level budget bowling style and aspirations you might be able to find a bargain ball online or in a local store but you will likely have trouble sorting all the options and should expect to pay the pro to fit you and drill the ball it is not recommended to get your ball fitted and drilled at a box store unless they specialize in sporting equipment and in particular bowling supplies if you buy from the pro shop though you will have free advice and free drilling decide on your grip if you purchase your ball you will have two basic choices the conventional grip where the middle and ring finger go into the ball up to the second joint of each finger this is the only grip option if you are using a house ball in this option a custom ball is drilled to accommodate the natural slant of your fingers in relation to each other and to the radius of the ball don t worry about this though the pro will take care of all the measurements and should make adjustments over your next few bowling sessions there should be no charge for the adjustments but ask just to be sure the fingertip grip in which the middle and ring finger go into the ball only up to the first joint the fingertip grip affords more leverage at release allowing you to put more juice on the shot that is impart more revolutions on the ball per unit time normally with a fingertip grip there will be rubberized inserts in each finger hole these afford a surer grip again the pro will set you up and should make adjustments gratis get your ball fitted and drilled if you are purchasing your ball the pro will take care of measuring your hand have the pro watch a couple of your shots that way the fit will account for your natural delivery style if you have not bowled before you might want to get a bit of instruction before showing the pro your shot if you ask the pro will give you a quick run down on the basics and get you started off on the right foot in the meantime finish reading this article to get a basic idea of the fundamental bowling swing which will get you strike after strike after strike undoubtedly the pro will offer you the opportunity to purchase a bag and recommended accessories you can purchase these on the spot or wait and see what turns up in the local thrift shops often bowling equipment shows up in good shape and you can pick up a ball for the kids and a bag for yourself really all you need at this point is a bowling ball sling also known as a buffer bag pick your bowling shoes it is mandatory that you use shoes specially designed for bowling these have medium soft rubber heels which stop you smoothly but quickly at the release point the soles are of leather and are designed to slide smoothly across the approach boards as you prepare to release your shot rental shoes are available at the desk and are normally paid for when you get your lane assignment 1 x research source if you plan to join a weekly bowling league house shoes are often included with the weekly fees ask about this if your center does not include free shoes for leagues you will save money overall by purchasing your own shoes right away they will be available in the pro shop or you can shop for bargains around town and online a word of caution about the shoes take care not to step in any liquid or spills bowling shoes are designed to slide smoothly right until the release if you step in water for example your slide will stop soon as it starts which is dangerous and may cause injury choose a house ball balls come in various weights which will likely be stamped into the balls alternatively the balls will be color coded for the color coded option the key should be posted conspicuously in the bowling center if not ask at the desk determine the proper starting weight pick a ball which seems fairly light holding the ball cradled in both hands extend your arms fully in front of your chest if you can hold the ball for only a couple of seconds without straining you have found a good starting weight if the ball wants to drop as soon as you push it away from your body the ball is too heavy try something a bit lighter if you can hold the ball at arm s length for quite some time the ball is way too light you want the heaviest ball that you can reasonably control if it is too light you will be able to jerk it this way and that during the swing and you will have inconsistent results select a ball with the proper span support the ball with your non dominant hand underneath insert the thumb of your bowling hand your dominant hand into the largest diameter hole and drape your middle finger and ring finger over the two remaining holes look for something where the crease of the second joint of both fingers is just over the edge of each hole if the finger holes are too far away and the edge of the hole falls between your first and second joint you will not be able to seat your fingers into the holes all the way the span is too great on the other hand if the span is too small the palm of your hand will not rest on the ball surface and you will necessarily adopt a pincher grip this is not a power grip and will result in a weak shot and relatively few strikes take the time to find at least one ball with a proper comfortable span for your hand if you are having a truly difficult time finding a ball of your targeted weight that has the proper span there is a strong possibility that you have picked a weight that is too heavy or light the heavier balls will normally have a larger span so you will need to look at balls that are heavier or lighter according to your needs if you are having trouble ask the bowling center staff for assistance they will help you arrive at a reasonable compromise for weight and span select the best finger hole size if you have identified several balls of the proper starting weight and span look for the one with the snuggest most comfortable finger holes typically the finger holes are drilled over large if you are finding that your fingers do not fit in the balls you have chosen a weight that is too light perhaps a kid s weight with proportionately smaller finger holes you want holes which are fairly snug but release your fingers easily 2 x research source determine your starting distance from the foul line stand with your back to the pins and your heels at the foul line take four and a half normal steps toward the scoring area and note the location where your toe tip ends generally this will be between the five round dots and the start of the approach 3 x research source if you find that your normal steps take you off of the alley your will have to start with your heels hanging a bit off the raised approach area and start with smaller steps building your pace and the length of your steps as you get closer to the foul line in this way you will avoid going over the line which stretches from gutter to gutter at the start of the gutter if you go over the foul line or any part of your body touches the lane past this line your pin fall is not counted and the pins are reset however you still lose your shot two per frame maximum but possibly three shots in the tenth frame only start with the toe of your on the board with the center dot before you start rolling strikes in every frame you ll need to figure out the best possible position from which to start your approach your non dominant foot will be whichever is opposite your bowling hand if you bowl right this will be your left foot put your left foot forward aligned just behind the center dot eventually you can adjust your starting alignment based on your natural tendencies but to start out and gauge your aim try starting in the center aim for the second arrow from the gutter on your dominant side about fifteen feet from the foul line you ll see the directional arrows that help you aim the center of the lane is generally the most oily part keeping the ball somewhat to the side is a good way to maximize your traction on the lane 4 x research source take several practice rolls to see where the ball goes bowl naturally keeping your shoulders parallel with the foul line and swinging your arm forward as straight as possible follow through when you release your hand should extend as if you were going to shake someone s hand pay careful attention to where the ball lands the pocket is the area immediately to one or the other side of the lead pin and is the area you want to hit to consistently roll strikes did you hit the pocket if so you ve found the correct starting position for your swing you ll want to align your non dominant foot with the center dot 5 x research source move in the direction of your miss if you missed right start your next throw a dot to the right of the center point if you missed left do the opposite while this may seem counter intuitive missing to one side means that your ball is hooking too early or too late keep the ball dead on by moving toward your miss after several practice throws you should be able to find your optimum starting position from which to bowl from there you can tweak your throw to improve your chances of hitting a strike every time practice your curve pro bowlers all bowl with some english or curvature on the ball because the pocket you re aiming for is somewhat on an angle the best way to hit it is to curve the ball in toward the pocket from the edge of the lane this is why you aim for an arrow to the side of the center the best way to ensure english on your throw is to maintain good handshake position on your follow through after you release the ball your hand should be up in the air as if you were going to shake the hand of the pin you re aiming toward 6 x research source find the right bowling ball using a ball that is too heavy or too light can drastically affect your accuracy experiment with balls that are slightly heavier than what feels normal and balls that are slightly lighter than you would normally use does your accuracy improve in either direction 7 x research source find the right speed firing the ball from the rocket launcher that is your bowling arm may seem like a good idea at first but it s not necessarily the most accurate way to throw extra force will often leave pins on the floor that softer and more accurate throws will pick up in general though you should throw the ball with as much force as you can throw accurately some modern alleys track the speed of your ball try to reduce the speed of your shot in small increments if you are blowing the pins off the lane slower precise pocket hits will keep the pins on the lane and allow them to mix improving your chance of clearing the deck and producing a strike adjust your grip on the bowling ball gripping too tightly particularly with the thumb can hook the ball in an inaccurate direction insert your fingers into the ball first if you ve got an appropriately fitted bowling ball they should go in as far as your big knuckle use your non bowling hand to steady the ball on your approach you ll typically want the thumb to release the ball a split second before the fingers make sure your fingernails are neat and trimmed to avoid catching on the fingerholes and throwing wonky balls,Sports-and-Fitness
how to practice proper bowling etiquette,proper bowling etiquette is important for many reasons first off it helps make the game a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved whether you are just having fun with friends or on a league second it helps keep everyone and everything safe read this article if you d like to know how you can have proper bowling etiquette next time you go out bowling,wear bowling shoes at all times while in the bowler s area if you wear street shoes you risk ruining the approaches and or the equipment when you are putting your bowling shoes on be sure that you move them as far away from walkways as possible to avoid anyone tripping on them if your street shoes are wet or dirty be sure that you take them off as far away from the lanes as possible if you track water mud or anything else onto the lanes then you run the risk of you or someone else falling flat on their face avoid eating or drinking while on the bowler s area something as simple as a drop of water could easily create a big hazard eat or drink either at a seating area that is usually located behind the general bowling area or simply just away from all of the lanes avoid swearing or shouting even if you were really upset about a missed strike remember that especially if you are at an open bowling session and there are families with children there they can likely hear you and it may cause them to be uncomfortable stay off of the approach unless it is your turn if it is not your turn either go to the seating area behind you or step out of any bowlers ways this can be an annoyance especially if they were in the middle of throwing their ball and you walked in front of them make sure that you have permission to use another person s ball if for whatever reason you need to use it ask them politely and make sure that you have a good reason if they end up saying no respect that and move on if you need to use another person s ball because your ball is stuck then simply let the next bowler on your lane know their ball may hit it or theirs may become stuck too if their ball becomes stuck too go up to a worker and tell them that you have a couple of bowling balls that are stuck it may take awhile to get them back but it may also avoid someone from becoming upset that their ball was used be ready to take your turn immediately most likely there are other bowlers on your lane who would like to bowl too therefore when it is your turn be sure you are walking up to the area immediately to avoid keeping everyone waiting if you need to use the bathroom try and time it out so you have a minute before your turn and go as quick as possible if you feel comfortable doing so you can also designate someone to bowl for you if you do not come back in time so that no one is kept waiting wait until the pin setting machine has finished its entire cycle and the sweep bar is lifted completely before you bowl while you should be ready to bowl immediately when it is your turn wait until that short process is complete because failing to do so could result in you damaging equipment or your ball and it may also result in your ball getting stuck 1 x research source avoid stepping over the foul line it is dangerous to do so because it can result in you getting oil on the approach which can be dangerous for anyone who is walking on it 2 x research source avoid throwing your ball down the wrong lane although you will likely be told if you are about to throw your ball down the wrong lane you may not be therefore it is important that you pay attention to which lane you are on at all times because if you throw your ball down the wrong lane the game will likely be delayed because the score will have to be changed step away from the approach immediately when your turn is finished this will immediately open up the approach so that someone else can bowl right away and it won t unnecessarily delay the game recognize that the bowler on the right is given priority if it is your turn and you as well as the person to the right of you are ready to bowl at the same time let them go first step off of the approach and wait patiently for them to finish,Sports-and-Fitness
how to bowl,bowling is both a fun way to spend time with friends and a serious competitive sport whether you want to know how to be a casual bowler or how to advance your bowling skills you ve come to the right place,understand the bowling lane before you begin to bowl you have to understand the function of the bowling lane a bowling lane is 60 feet 18 3 m long from the foul line the line closest to the bowler to the head pin the pin closest to the bowler there are gutters on either side of the bowling lane if a ball veers off the lane it goes into the gutters and is out of play 1 x research source the approach area is 15 feet 4 6 m long and ends at the foul line the bowler cannot overstep the foul line during their approach or their shot won t count if a ball goes into the gutters and then bounces out and hits the pins it won t count understand the bowling pins ten pins are arranged at the end of the bowling lane at the beginning of every frame they are arranged in a triangle formation with the point of the triangle facing the bowler there is one pin in the first row which is the head pin two pins in the second row three in the third and four in the fourth 2 x research source the locations of the pins are assigned numbers 1 10 the pins in the back row have the numbers 7 10 the pins in the row above the back row are numbered 4 6 the pins in the second row are numbered 2 3 and the head pin is pin 1 all pins will earn the bowler one point if they are hit the numbers are based on location not value learn the lingo before you can call yourself a true bowler you should be aware of a few different bowling terms knowing these terms will also make it much easier for you to understand the rules here they are 3 x research source a strike is when you knock down all the pins with the ball on your first try a spare is when you knock down all the pins on your second try a split is when the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin the pin closest to you but leaves two or more pins that are non adjacent it s tough to hit a spare in this situation especially if you have a 7 10 split which is the hardest split to hit a turkey is three strikes in a row if any pins remain after the bowler s turn it s called an open frame understand how a game of bowling works one bowling game consists of 10 frames each frame is equal to one turn for the bowler the bowler s objective is to knock down as many pins as possible in a frame ideally all of them 4 x research source a bowler can roll the ball twice in each frame provided that they do not hit a strike a bowler gets an extra turn on the tenth frame if they knock down all the pins on the first turn learn the scoring if a bowler has an open frame then they simply get credit for the number of pins they knocked down if a bowler knocked down 6 pins after two turns they simply get two turns however if a bowler hits a spare or a strike the rules get slightly more complicated 5 x research source if a bowler hits a spare then they should place a slash mark on their score sheet after their next turn they will receive 10 points plus the number of pins they knock down with that turn so if they knock down 3 pins after their first turn then they will get 13 points before their second turn if they then knock down 2 pins in their second turn they get a total of 15 points for that round if a bowler hits a strike they should record an x on their scoresheet the strike will earn the bowler ten points plus the number of pins knocked down on the player s next two turns in the following round the most a bowler can score in one game is 300 points this represents 12 strikes in a row or 120 pins that were knocked down in 12 frames a perfect game has 12 strikes and not ten because if the bowler gets a strike on the last frame then they can take two more turns if those two turns are also strikes they will have 300 points if a player rolls a spare in the last frame then they can take one more turn find a bowling alley go online to find a local bowling alley that suits your needs try to find a place that offers bowling lessons or has beginner bowling leagues if you want to go bowling with friends find a place that s rated for having a fun environment and maybe some food and snacks as well go to the bowling alley you ve chosen talk to the fellow bowlers and staff and see if you can even join a game alternately you can go to an alley with a group of friends if you ask a crowd if you can join their game make sure it isn t too competitive you may even make new friends at the alley get some bowling shoes if you re a beginner you can just rent shoes at the alley if you want to kick up your game you can buy a pair of your own shoes street shoes won t work for bowling because they ll either make you stick to the floor instead of sliding naturally or they ll make you slip too much and injure yourself 6 x research source if you don t wear bowling shoes you can also damage or leave scuff marks on the alley floor rent a pair of shoes unless you want to get in trouble before you even start bowling don t forget to wear socks or bring socks to the alley some alleys sell socks but they will be expensive choose the right ball before you can begin to bowl you need to find a ball that is the right weight for you and which is the right size for your fingers the balls will be labeled based on their weight so a ball with 8 written on it will weigh 8 pounds here s how to find a ball of the right size and weight 7 x research source weight a 14 16 lb ball would work for most adults with bigger hands and a 10 14 lb ball would work for most adults with smaller hands generally it s better to have a ball that is a little heavier because it will help you gain momentum a general rule is that a ball should weigh 10 as much as your body so if you weigh 140 pounds you should bowl with a 14 lb ball size of the thumb hole your thumb should fit snugly into the single thumb hole you should be able to take it out of the hole without it snagging or getting stuck but the hole shouldn t be so large that you have to squeeze your thumb in the hole to hang on size of the middle finger holes once you ve inserted your thumb you should lay your middle and ring finger across the other two holes if the span is correct your two fingers should easily and comfortably lay over the two holes so the middle joint lines up with the side of the hole closest to your thumb curl your two fingers into the holes to make sure they fit snugly in the hole like your thumb find your bowling lane once you ve signed up at the alley and put on your shoes you will be directed to a bowling lane if you get to choose your lane pick a lane that is away from loud or noisy people but it s your choice you may be able to bowl better if you re surrounded by other bowlers hold the ball correctly first pick up your ball and head to the right spot in front of the bowling lane place your middle and ring finger in the top 2 holes and place your thumb into the bottom hole 8 x research source hold the ball slightly to your side with your bowling hand underneath the ball and your other hand resting on the bottom side of the ball for extra support keep your thumb on top of the ball at 10 00 position if you re right handed use the 2 00 position if you re a lefty approach the foul line the standard approach consists of standing with your back straight your shoulders centered squarely towards your target and your knees slightly bent your ball arm should hand straight down by your side your back should be tilted slightly forward 9 x research source your feet should be slightly apart and your slide foot should be placed slightly in front of the other foot your slide foot will be the opposite of the hand you use to bowl a right handed bowler will slide with their left foot work on aiming the ball your bowling lane should have a series of dots 7 feet 2 1 m down the lane and black arrows about fifteen feet down the lane if you re a beginning bowler you should aim to roll the ball in the center of these marks once you develop your bowling skills you can aim to the left or the right of the marks when you hook the ball even if you aim your ball through the center of the marks you may not be able to hit the pins because the ball can slow down or roll off toward the gutters just notice where the ball rolls when you do and don t bowl a solid frame and adjust your aim accordingly focus on aiming at the marks not the pins release the ball maintain a straight forward non twisting approach of your body as your ball and hand position should be held relatively the same underneath and behind the ball during the swing swing your ball arm smoothly back and then forward to release the ball release the ball when your arm has moved as far forward as it can go when released properly your thumb should come out first followed by the fingers this should help get rotation on the ball which should help the ball hook and carry once it gets down the lane keep your eye on the target you re aiming towards as you release the ball if you look down at your feet or the ball you will lose balance and won t be able to aim your ball correctly wipe your hands after your turn is over make sure your hands are completely dry before you pick up the ball to start bowl each time use a cloth to wipe your hands or at least wipe your hands on your pants if you don t have one if your hands are still sweaty the ball can slip out of your hands you can also use rosin which can be found in most pro bowling shops to make your fingers and thumb slightly tacky and less slippery keep score throughout the game most bowling alleys will have a computer near the sitting area that allows you to keep score if an alley doesn t have a computer then you will be given a score sheet to record your scores either way the process is the same here s how to keep score the area in the upper left of each frame is to record the first ball and the box to the left is for the second ball and if you have a strike a strike is marked with a x and a spare with a finish close to the foul line the distance between the delivery line and you should be of about 6 inches if you want to have an optimal release this means that the ball is lofted a small distance over the foul line before it makes contact with the lane thus the ball gets further down the lane and it preserves energy when hitting the pins finishing too far from the foul line means you ll have to move closer to it when you start in the stance 10 x research source remember that a strike is 10 plus the next two balls whereas a spare is 10 plus the next ball if you strike in the first ball in the 10th frame you get two more balls to determine your final score 300 is the highest score you can get watch bowling on tv carefully observe the professionals and see what techniques they use you can also watch video clips of expert bowlers online try to imitate the bowler s stances in your own home just remember that you re watching experts and that your bowling technique will be much simpler than theirs ask for advice if you want to really improve your game seek out help from other more advanced bowlers and from coaches it will always help to have a critical eye watching you and you will gain new insight join a bowling league this is a great way to keep up a regular practice and to make new friends read carefully and follow all the specific rules that are posted at the alley while on the lanes wear only bowling shoes don t start bowling until the pin setting machine has finished its cycle allow the bowler in an adjacent lane to play first if you both approach the runway at the same time otherwise the player who arrives first goes first 11 x research source don t step or go beyond the foul line even in casual play bowling is a sport so play fair 12 x research source if you cross the foul line you also risk slipping and other personal injury the ball should be bowled down the lane avoid any throwing or tossing of the ball as it may damage the lane don t play your game on another lane you should have enough space on your own 13 x research source always ask for permission first when using someone else s ball avoid distracting other players while they are bowling check your language and limit swearing as much as you can be ready when it s your turn to bowl try to keep the score accurate almost all alleys have now automated score keeping,Sports-and-Fitness
how to bowl your best game ever,like any other sport bowling takes time and practice but if you master these steps and take the time to make them habits you ll quickly be on the way to your best game ever many people don t know the simple tools like the arrows and dots that bowling alleys have to help you hit any pin you want and once you learn to spin the ball properly strikes will start pouring on the score sheet getting a good score is about smarts technique and picking up spares things everyone can improve on,make sure you have a bowling ball the feels comfortable in your hands bowling balls are all made differently spinning and hooking at different rates you want a ball you can comfortably raise and lower but not so light you could throw it around with ease it s always best to get a ball of your own instead of borrowing it or renting it as you ll have a better fit and better results the average weight for adult men is 14lb and 13lb for women or smaller men children usually start at 12lbs 1 x research source make sure your fingers are firmly in the holes but come out without sticking you shouldn t be squeezing your finger or thumb muscles to keep the ball on your hand just lightly gripping it balls come with a variety of flare potential and rg radius ratings these tell you how likely the ball is to curve back to the middle after a throw the higher the ratings the more the ball hooks think about your throw straight on or hooked and buy accordingly get good bowling shoes your bowling shoes are just like regular shoes they need to be taken care of and it s always best if they are your own good shoes have a smooth regular sole and fit you comfortably get a half size bigger than your regular shoe size so that your feet are comfortable as you bowl start in an athletic upright bowling stance the most important thing is where you hold the ball put your fingers in the holes and balance the ball on your palm around stomach or chest height using the opposite hand to support the weight the ball should be slightly to the right side of your body in alignment with the right seam of your shirt right handed bowlers your knees are slightly bent and your shoulders relaxed and your left foot is on the big dot in the center of the lane right handers keep your wrist strong so that the ball appears like a natural extension of your arm you don t want your wrist to droop down towards the floor 2 x research source find your mark on the lane there are seven arrows on the lane do not aim for the middle as it usually leads to a split if you re right handed aim for the arrow just to the right of the center if you are left handed aim for the arrow just to the left this mark is the best starting place for strikes if it is easier move your feet to the right or left before you start approaching the lane so that your feet are lined up with the correct marker then just throw straight ahead almost all balls will hook at least a little and the lanes are designed for this you want your ball to hit between the first pin and the next one in line behind it for strikes this is called the pocket time your approach so that your opposite foot lands in front of the lane the classic move is the 4 step approach landing with the foot opposite your throwing arm for right handers step forward with your right foot then comfortably walk forward so that your left foot lands within 6 or so of the lane your right foot will then swing out of the way behind your left foot allowing you to throw the ball freely practice a few times without the ball until you find a good starting spot that lets you arrive at the line left foot down every time there are 2 lines of dots along the approach to the lane that are good starting points for you to begin 3 x research source practice taking 4 even steps each time landing your left foot comfortably before practicing the throw you could also start at the foul line beginning of lane and walk four steps backward to determine the best starting spot for you 4 x research source reverse this is you are left handed the foot opposite your throwing arm should be planted at the lane if you are left handed you will land and plant with your right foot push your arm forward on the first step of your approach as you take the first step of the approach push the ball out in front of you so that your arm is extended use your left hand to support the weight of the ball as your hold it in front of you the following steps will be for a right handed thrower remember to keep the ball out to the right side not in the middle of your body drop your arm so that the ball arcs back towards your leg as you take the first step with your left leg the ball will drop so that your right arm and left leg are roughly even keep your grip on the ball and let it fall freely your elbow will be slightly bent but gravity is doing most of the work as the ball comes down let the ball continue arcing behind you and up towards shoulder height as you step again with your right foot the ball will continue behind your body and up reaching its apex as you plant your right foot you will be swinging it back here focus on keeping your wrist strong as you do this not letting it rotate around the higher your arm goes back the more powerful the throw will be do not go too far as this could cause injury swing the ball down as you plant your left foot by the line come down with the ball planning to release it as you pass your leg your right leg should swing behind the left leg getting it out of the way for your shot it doesn t have to swing way out like a pro bowler just out of the way enough that you don t hit it with the ball release the ball by flicking your wrist and fingers up towards your head as the ball leaves your fingers snap them up as if you were closing your hands think of the children s game where you have a quarter in your hand and someone is trying to take it before you close your hand you should release as the ball passes your planted leg at its lowest point 5 x research source look at your mark when release don t look at the pins or you will get distracted and throw off key the arrows are your target and the ball will do the rest remember you are aiming for the first or second arrow to the right of the center arrow follow through to protect your arm continue your arm back up on its arc towards your head think of drinking from a soda can bringing your fingers and wrist up to head height know where you want the ball to hit strikes are most common when the ball hits the pocket the space between the front center pin and the next pin behind it directly for right handed bowlers this means curving the ball so it strikes right between the front pin and the second pin on the right this scatters the front set of pins cascading them into all of the pins behind them 6 x research source more power means the pins scatter faster potentially knocking over more pins curving the ball is essential to hit consistent strikes remember to work on snapping your fingers and wrist as you follow through left handers want to hit between the front pin and the left pin in the second row know how lane conditions affect your throw for strikes an unknown secret of bowling is that every lane is a little different lanes are oiled up so that the ball glides straight over the wood without hooking constantly when the ball is in less oiled or dry areas it tends to hook more taking it off the line you threw it on to make matters even more complicated the lane patterns will change throughout the game but bowling your best game ever requires you to read the lane and adjust your shots accordingly not throwing the same shot 23 times 7 x research source the most common pattern is wet in the front and middle and dry on the outsides and back like a big triangle of oil pointing into the center of the lane this means a throw to the outside will curve back to the middle where a throw in the middle might not curve until the last second this is why you aim out to the side instead of down the center it cause the ball to move out then curve back in right to the pocket as the day goes on oil gets picked up by the balls making the lane drier and causing the shots to hook more many tournaments have alternate oil patterns that force you to change your shots to get strikes ask to see an oil pattern or warm up with different angles and starting positions to find your strike mark 8 x research source find your strike mark while warming up starting in the center and throwing for the arrow just to the right of center right handers is a great starting place to learn strikes but you need to adjust it for your personal thrown make sure you watch the arrow you throw at not the pins if you are hitting your mark but still missing the pocket you should move your starting position 9 x research source if your ball is going too far to the left move 2 3 boards to the left this means your throw will angle more to the right giving it more time to curve back to the left if your ball is moving too far to the right move your feet 2 3 boards to the right this will get your ball out of the oil allowing it to curve more back to the center if you still have trouble or the ball is hooking a ton move your mark to the right or left the closer to center your mark is the less the ball will hook however you should move your starting position first move your starting stance closer to the center as the lane dries up near the end of a game especially with a big group you may notice your normal shots are hooking more to the center and you re missing the pocket as you notice your shots curving more to the center move 1 2 boards to the left right handed throwers and keep throwing at your normal mark the arrow just to the right of the center arrow focus again on having the center of the ball hit this mark not on the pins if you re hitting your mark but still missing pins move your feet starting position to accommodate 10 x research source this extra hook happens because the balls pick up oil throughout the game removing it from the lane and causing it to dry out a dry lane hooks more understand how scoring works to plan your shots well knowing how bowling is actually scored helps you decide which pins to go for and when the basics are easy there are ten pins and each pin you hit is worth a point however spares and strikes are worth more than just 10 pins strikes x are worth 10 points plus whatever you hit on the next two throws spares are worth 10 points plus whatever you hit on the next throw this means a single frame can be worth more than 10 points if you get a strike or spare 11 x research source for example say you throw a strike in the first frame in the second frame you hit 2 pins on the first throw and 3 on the next one for 5 total pins your first frame would be worth 15 points 10 for the strike 2 for the first throw and 3 for the second you still score however the 5 points from the second frame too so your total score after two frames is 20 points 15 2 3 if your throw three strikes in a row your first frame is worth 30 points 10 for the strike plus 10 for the second frame and 10 for the third frame you cannot score you second and third frames until you take another throw spares add to your next shot only so if i throw a spare in one frame then throw a gutter ball immediately after my spare is only worth 10 points 10 0 no matter what i do after that a spare followed by a strike is worth 20 points 10 10 if you throw a strike or spare in the 10th frame you get a free shot at the end making the 10th frame the only one with three potential rolls thus you should always go for the spare in the 10th frame remember that speed makes it easier to pickup spares higher speeds mean there is less time for the ball to react and turn off line practice a straight consistent spare shot and you will beat many a people who throw the same shot every time everybody can strike not everybody spares lower or weaken your wrist on your shot to get less spin and a straighter throw this provides a more accurate shot as less spin means the ball will hook less to weaken your wrist start your shot with your wrist curved slightly down towards the floor on your follow through don t let your wrist and fingers snap up as much this may take some practice but changing wrist positions is one of the most important skills for intermediate or advanced bowlers 12 x research source adjust your starting position based on your spare by adjusting your starting position you can often throw right at your normal mark and still get a spare the boards on the lane thin wooden pieces running to the pins are made to give you a measurement system for aiming if you need to hit a pin left of the center you move several boards to the right and vice verse you then throw at the same mark you aim at for strikes the system is actually pretty easy to learn and is reversed for the opposite direction of throws if you want to hit the first pin to the left of the center move your start position 3 boards to the right if you want to hit the second pin to the left of the center move 6 boards to the right use the middle of the lane when trying to hit the far right and left pins most lanes are the slickest in the middle oil is applied to lanes in complex patterns that determine how much a ball hooks more oil means less hook or a straighter more accurate shot since a right hander going after the far right pins doesn t want the ball to curve to the middle you should throw diagonally across center instead this ensures a straighter flight curving just a bit at the end to avoid the gutter and hitting all the pins for example there may be one solo pin on the far right side of the lane while you could try and hug the gutter the ball will naturally want to spin to the center because the outside of the line is low on oil instead start your walk from the far left of the lane throwing the ball from the left diagonally across the middle to the far right pins aim for the most pins possible during a split unless you are skilled enough to hit the outside edge of a lone pin shooting it like a missile at the pack of three pins in the back corner you should take the sure fire three pins this is especially important if you threw a strike the previous frame because any pins you hit now get counted twice once for the strike and once in this frame if you didn t get a strike in the previous frame you might be more likely to take a risk now trying to get a spare to boost your score for later 13 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to score bowling,most modern bowling alleys are set up for electronic scoring but understanding how to score bowling is important when electronic scoring is not available to make sure you re keeping score correctly you ll first need to practice scoring individual frames then as you go add up those frames so you know your final score at the end of the game keep in mind that some pinfalls like spares and strikes have their own special scoring rules,understand the parts of the bowling scorecard on the far left edge of the bowing scorecard is a column of empty spaces where you can write the names of each player who is participating in the game to the right of the names are 10 scorecard frames each frame is used to total the score of a single turn frame use the scorecard frame that corresponds to the turn you re taking above each column of scorecard frames is a number these numbers proceed from left to right starting with 1 and rising to 10 tally each player s score within the scorecard that matches the frame they are bowling for instance on your first turn use the first scorecard frame on your fifth turn use the fifth scorecard frame and so on write the score for the first roll in the upper left box for that turn each player gets to bowl twice in each turn except in the last tenth frame unless they get all the pins down with their first ball each player will bowl a maximum of 21 times per game it s important that you record each of these rolls individually so record the number of pins you knock down on your first roll in the upper left box for instance if you knock over 2 pins on your first roll write the numeral 2 in the upper left box write the second roll s score in the upper right hand box for that turn after you ve rolled for the second time add that number to your scorecard make sure you only write down the number of pins you knocked down in your second roll not the total number of pins you knocked down for the turn 1 x research source for example if you knocked over 4 pins on your second roll and 2 pins on your first roll you d write the number 4 in the upper right hand corner not the number 6 write an x in the small box in the top right of the scorecard frame to indicate a strike a strike indicates that you knocked down all 10 pins in your first roll while the small box in the top right of the scorecard frame is typically reserved for scoring information that relates to the second roll of your turn scoring rules make an exception for the strike 2 x research source place a forward slash in the small box in the top right corner of the scorecard frame to indicate a spare a forward slash a line connecting the bottom left corner to the upper right corner of the box in the upper right indicates that you didn t knock down all the pins on your first roll but you did on your second roll 3 x research source make sure to indicate how many pins you knocked over in the first roll in the upper center box for example if you knocked down 3 pins on your first roll and 7 pins on the second roll write a 3 in the box in the upper center and a forward slash in the smaller box on the upper right mark a foul by writing an f if you step past the foul line the line beyond which a bowler cannot step on your first roll for that turn place an f in the upper center box if you step past the foul line on your second roll for that turn place an f inside the small box in the upper right of the scorecard frame you re still allowed a second roll if you foul on your first roll of the turn mark the scorecard with a dash if you miss the pins if your ball goes in the gutter or if you otherwise miss the pins indicate the miss with a horizontal dash for instance if your ball went in the gutter on your first roll you d mark a dash in the small box in the top center of the scorecard frame if your ball went in the gutter on your second roll you d mark a dash in the small box to the upper right of the scorecard frame 4 x research source if you miss the pins on one roll but knock some of them over on the other make sure to record the score for the roll where you did knock some pins over add the total number of pins knocked down in your 2 rolls when your turn is complete for instance if your current score is 30 and the numbers at the top of the scorecard frame you just completed are 5 and 4 you d add 9 5 plus 4 to 30 your current score would then be 39 5 x research source write your current score in the bottom of the scorecard frame beneath the numbers for the turn you just completed score a spare by adding 10 to the number of pins knocked down on the next roll a spare occurs when you knock down the remaining pins on the second roll of your turn for instance if you knock down 1 pin on your first roll and 9 pins on your second roll you ve scored a spare a spare can be worth anywhere from 10 to 20 points depending on how much you score in the next roll in order to get the maximum number of points you d have to make a strike on your next roll 6 x research source when you get a spare wait to calculate the score for that turn until you roll your first roll for your next turn then write that score in your previous turn s frame for example let s say you re bowling in turn 2 and you scored 6 points in turn 1 in turn 2 you roll a 3 on your first turn and a 7 on your second you ve rolled a spare instead of adding up 3 7 to get 10 for that turn and adding it to 6 from your previous turn wait until you ve rolled the first roll of turn 3 if you roll a 7 you then add up 6 your turn 1 score 10 your spare 7 your first roll of turn 3 to get 23 note that you still add up your rolls for turn 3 if you rolled a 7 and then a 2 you d add 23 your score in turn 2 9 to get 32 for turn 3 score a strike by adding 10 to the sum of the next turn a strike is when you knock down all of the pins on your first roll for that turn a strike s worth can be anywhere from 10 to 30 points depending on how you roll after the initial strike 7 x research source when you get a strike wait to calculate the score for that turn until you ve completely finished the next turn for instance let s say you get a strike in turn 1 in turn 2 you roll a 2 and a 6 for a total of 8 points once you finish turn 2 your score for turn 1 is 18 10 for the strike 8 in turn 2 write the number 18 in the main square in your scorecard frame for turn 1 then add 18 8 for a total of 26 and write the number 26 in the main square in your scorecard frame for turn 2 note that if you miss all 10 pins on the 1st roll of your turn and then knock all 10 down on the second roll it s still considered a spare not a strike only use the upper right corner box in the 10th turn if you roll a spare or a strike the third box in the 10th turn is known as the fill box which helps decide what your spare or strike will be worth if you roll one in the 10th turn 8 x research source for instance if you knock down 1 pin in your first roll and 9 pins in your second roll you d write 1 in the small box furthest to the left and a in the top center box then you d bowl once more add the number you roll to 10 to calculate your spare for example if you rolled a 7 on your third roll in the 10th turn you d add 1 9 to calculate the spare 7 for a total of 17 for that turn alternatively if you roll a strike on your first roll of the 10th turn roll twice more if you roll an 8 and then a 1 for a total of 9 your score for that turn is 19 if you do score a spare or a strike in the 10th turn tally the total from left to right determine the winner by comparing the final score of the 10th frame for instance if your 10th frame score is 110 and your friend s is 100 you ve won the game congratulations try to get as close to 300 as possible 300 is the perfect score in bowling which means you got a strike in every turn while few players are that good practice your bowling skills to try to get as close as you can to perfect the lowest possible score is zero which means all balls were gutter balls or fouls,Sports-and-Fitness
how to curve a bowling ball,you have the straight shot down and now it s time to look like the pros learning to throw a curve bowling ball takes a lot of time and practice but the effort pays off with the newfound confidence you will have after mastering this skill and improving your bowling score,start with the right stance and grip you want to be several inches from the foul line and preferably at least four steps away from your release some people take longer and that s fine but at least four steps is ideal line your feet up with the arrow on the lane you are aiming for which will depend on how hefty your curve is if you have your own ball you probably know how to grip it however if you re working with a house ball you may need to adjust your style house balls generally have knuckle grips you want your fingers and especially thumb to come out swiftly so don t jam them in there hold the ball so it aligns straight with your wrist hand positions are covered later on in this article it s more important during your swing than before always focus on the arrow on the lane that you want to hit never focus on the pin you are aiming for it is a lot easier to hit a mark that is ten feet in front of you than one that fifty the arrow you want to hit will vary on lane conditions wet vs dry to change the aim it is easier to change where you stand at the start than to change the arrow if you are missing to the left move your starting point to the left and vice versa it sounds counter intuitive but if you move to the left and hit the same arrow the ball will go farther right at the beginning before swinging to left there are dots on the floor to help you adjust moving your feet over just one board can be the difference between a strike and the dreaded 7 10 split start your approach like you would a straight shot your approach is the same as any standard shot the change is in your follow through and mostly in your hand bring the ball back into the swing position while keeping your palm behind the ball just as you normally do be sure to keep your wrist strong if you carry too much of the weight on your wrist or twist it back and forth you could hurt yourself or at the very least wear yourself down before your frames are up release the ball at the bottom of your swing pulling your thumb out before your fingers the idea behind the hook is at the very end your fingers are the only thing containing the ball and they spin it as it releases hence why your thumb needs to get out of the way here are a few hand position options 1 x research source the standard way to hook the ball is to place your two fingers and thumb in the three holes as normal in other words change nothing some people choose to not put their thumb in the ball at all and instead sort of cup the ball on their palm and or wrist as they swing the ball back and release it in the follow through and yet a few choose to only place one finger the index finger in the slot and palm the ball spinning in the same motion on the release however you risk the ball turning in your grip and that can lead to sprained wrists and fingers rotate your fingers up along the outside of the ball as you release directing the ball s spin with your fingers continue moving your hand up on your swing to direct the ball down the lane finishing in a handshake position ideally you want to go from a 4 o clock position to a 7 o clock position the ball should be totally out of your hands by the seven o clock position and your arm should follow through to the 12 o clock position with your hand up by your ear all while your eyes are lock on the arrow you are trying to hit try hard not to subconsciously decelerate your swing in an effort to concentrate on and nail your hook the same power is still needed or if you do account for the differential when you resume your normal throw the hook could be very different learn to control the degree of your curve by varying the ball s position and timing your release to increase the degree of the curve release your fingers from the ball more rapidly your counterclockwise motion could also be more or less drastic 2 x research source with a little practice you will know if you ve thrown a good ball or not by how close the arrow you are if you re not getting it isolate the variables and experiment with each one alone try starting from a different start spot try switching up your footwork heck experiment with different balls it s possible that your wrist and hand positioning is just fine and there s another element that s mixing it up use a tennis ball to practice a great way to practice your hook shot without having to make an embarrassing trip to the bowling alley is to practice with a tennis ball it ll go straight when you throw it but when it hits the bounce it ll veer off to the side if you re doing it right of course 3 x research source another option is a pool ball but the damage potential of nearby objects is a bit more substantial use a bowling ball that is a few pounds lighter than the ball you would normally use as you re learning a lighter ball allows you to focus on learning the new throwing technique while you definitely want to get up to your normal ball sooner rather than later the lighter ball can help you concentrate on what your hands should be doing just don t get too used to it think of it like spiraling a football only upside down if you have experience spiraling a football it s the same general principle just under handed your fingers move along the side of the ball in much the same way just think of throwing a football underhanded trying to maintain the same spin it starts cupped in your hand and the last point of contact is with the tips of your fingers as it spins off if you re using a house ball know that it could be very difficult those balls at the bowling alley are meant for straight shots hooking them could require different more outrageous methodology to get the same natural hook effect so if you don t have your own don t stress it could be your equipment the general rule of thumb is that you choose a ball that s 10 of your body weight if you re 160 pounds choose a 16 pound ball 4 x research source that is if you re of normal health and have no reason why a lighter ball would be more down your bowling alley get a ball with a fingertip grip certain balls most house balls come with knuckle grip where the holes go down to your second knuckle but a fingertip grip is much more conducive to throwing a hooked ball since your thumb and fingers have to come out the actions are a lot swifter and smoother 5 x research source get your own ball with a urethane or resin coating a urethane coverstock on your bowling ball will make your hook shot so much easier they don t absorb oil from the lane and they provide way more friction than your standard plastic ball the house ball those two things combined set that hook up for success 6 x research source a resin coating can actually dig into the oil in the lane upping the chance that you hit exactly where you re aiming for but they re quite an investment and only for the most serious of bowlers if you re considering getting your own ball ask about rg ratings and coverstock a ball with a high differential of rg rating will create a really sharp hook 7 x research source however you could have a ball with a low differential so long as it has a matte finish coverstock to combat lane oil if you re dealing with a dry lane at your home alley that is consider a stiff or pearl coverstock so many options when in doubt explain your situation to the assistant as long as you give them all your variables and what you d like to do they can find the perfect ball for you don t choose a ball drilled to your fingers and with your axis point until you have your hook down as you get better at it your hook changes so wait it out you want a ball that s all your own when you re at your peak,Sports-and-Fitness
how to spin a bowling ball,whether you have watched a professional bowling event at home or you are a casual enthusiast who has paid attention at the alley you have likely noticed that the most successful bowlers know how to consistently spin the ball in order to hook the ball into the pins spin refers to the ball s rotation along its axis as it moves down the lane and is largely dependent on how you release the ball as the ball travels along the boards towards the pins the rotating axis gradually tilts upwards causing a hook delivery that enters the pin deck at an angle and increases your chance of a strike 1 x research source it s not the easiest technique to master but the results make it worthwhile to learn,find a ball with the right grip for you the holes must fit your fingers in such a way that you can hold the ball without having to squeeze and you can let go without your fingers getting stuck because you will be imparting rotation on the ball in the final split seconds that your hand is in contact with it the importance of grip cannot be overstated with the ball resting in the palm of your dominant hand put your middle and ring finger all the way into the two holes that are side by side and your thumb in the hole under them the holes should be the size of the fingers and thumb and you should be able to hold the ball easily in the palm of your hand there shouldn t be tension in the web of your thumb nor should it be slack 2 x research source it should take very little pressure to hold the ball in your hand if you could break an egg with that amount of pressure it s too much identify the type of ball you are using the characteristics of the core or interior weight block of the bowling ball play an important part in the ball s performance while there are a number of different core alignments there are two basic categories into which all balls fit determine which type you are using before you get started 3 x research source look over your bowling ball and see if it has just one pin the spot on the exterior usually of a different color indicating the orientation of the core or a single normal pin plus a second psa indicator mass bias pin if there is only one pin the ball should have a symmetric weight block if you bisected the ball along the axis of the pin you would discover that both sides are symmetric this type of ball may be easier for a beginner to handle a ball with an asymmetric weight block should possess two pins or a pin and an indicator just as the name indicates these balls do not contain symmetric cores and can contain any shape from that of a cube to something resembling the letter l it may prove slightly more difficult for a beginner to attain consistent performance with these bowling balls but practice with a single ball can certainly change that select a ball of the appropriate weight there are two separate guidelines used to suggest the size of ball that should be used one rule of thumb focuses on the sex of the bowler and suggests that adult women should use a 10 14 pound ball while adult men use a 14 16 pound ball 4 x research source the alternate guideline states that a bowler should use a ball roughly 10 of their body weight up to the 16 pound maximum size of the ball for those over 160 pounds in weight 5 x research source it is important to use a ball of the appropriate weight in order to impart the necessary amount of spin a strong individual using a smallish ball could easily impart too much torque and put the ball in the gutter a weaker individual using too heavy a ball could struggle to impart enough spin in order to make the ball hook the weight of the ball should be clearly marked on it determine where the pocket is the pocket is the space between two pins that you want to target with the ball if you re right handed the pocket is the space between the number 1 pin the foremost pin and the number 3 pin the pin just behind and to the right of number 1 if you re left handed your pocket is between the number 1 and number 2 pin the pin just behind and to the left of number 1 grip the bowling ball the style of grip that you use can determine the intensity of the ball s hook in other words at what angle the ball enters the pocket remember that the greater the angle the better your scoring potential a relaxed grip is more likely to produce a straighter roll and thus a minimal hook in this grip the hand is flexed back at the wrist so that as you pass into the forward swing it is on top of the ball for a strong grip the hand bends forward as if to cradle the ball between your palm and inner wrist if seen from the side the angle from your forearm to your thumb should appear to be 90 degrees this grip can provide a greater amount of spin and from that a greater hook a firm grip is an intermediate form that results in a moderate hook in this grip the wrist neither bends nor flexes creating a continuous line from your forearm through your hand 6 x research source decide where your stance should be based on the combination of pocket position and grip as you face the lane imagine its boards grouped into three sections outside left towards the left gutter middle and outside right towards the right gutter keeping in mind the strength of your grip and the anticipated amount of hook it will produce decide which board s your sliding forward foot should align with relaxed grip the ball should travel straight down the lane into the pocket so if you re right handed your stance should be in the outside right and lefties in the outside left firm grip your stance should be in the middle so the ball curves moderately either left or right and enters your target pocket strong grip you want to allow plenty of room for the ball s hook to curve around and enter the pocket if you re right handed you should be on the outside left side if you re left handed you should be on the outside right 7 x research source think about your approach before you begin one of the standard forms is referred to as the four step approach for this approach begin standing up straight with your feet directly under your body hold the ball from underneath with your bowling hand at about mid chest height higher for slower bowlers lower for faster bowlers and support the ball with your non bowling hand as you move through the four steps keep your bowling arm s elbow as close to your hip as possible bend your knees slightly and keep your feet pointed towards the pins your shoulders should be squarely facing front the following directions are for right handed bowlers if you are left handed reverse the sides take one step forward with your right foot and simultaneously bring the ball forward to a position over that foot keep your non bowling hand supporting the ball at this point move your left foot forward as you lower the ball close to a knee level position and then further back behind you making a half circle your non bowling hand will have released the ball at this point take another step forward with your right leg at the same time you should be entering the highest point of your backswing with the ball bring the ball forward as you take your last step toward the line with your left leg your right leg should subtly pass sideways behind your left as you plant your left leg and release the ball lower your hips and shift your weight slightly back bending your torso forward at a 15 degree angle 8 x research source keep your arm and wrist straight during the backswing you will not impart spin by bending or twisting your wrist or arm at this point 9 x research source instead it is through proper delivery and release of the ball that you will impart the spin that results in a hook release the ball as your arm moves between the laces and toe of your forward sliding shoe maintain a constant grip as your hand moves into the forward swing passing the heel of your sliding shoe the left foot for right handed bowlers and then release the ball as it passes the laces this is the optimum point for momentum to carry the ball onto the lane 10 x research source make sure your thumb is the first finger out of the ball the spin comes from your fingers as they release the ball rather than the wrist releasing the thumb first lets the ball roll off the hand which is where it gets the torque it needs for spin rotate your hand just slightly from the wrist at the moment of release a small 15 degree rotation counterclockwise for right handed bowlers and clockwise for left handed helps add spin 11 x research source imagine positioning your hand as if coming into a handshake follow through with the swing continue to move your arm upward and forward toward the pocket as you release the ball and after adjust based on results you must first work on consistency the ability to put all the elements together and repeat them are the keys to success in the process think about things like your stance position or the type of grip that you employ also work on your timing with the four step approach you want to make sure that your foot and the ball arrive at the foul line at the same time try recording yourself bowling to get a better sense of how good your timing is,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hold a bowling ball,bowling is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages holding a bowling ball correctly will give you better aim and this will ultimately improve your game like any sport improving your bowling grip will take time and practice,insert your fingers into the ball if you re using the popular 3 hole bowling ball place your dominant hand thumb in the larger bottom hole and your middle and ring fingers in the two adjacent holes at the top 1 x research source use both hands to hold the ball rest the ball in your dominant hand but use the support of your free hand to cradle the ball from underneath as you move towards the lane this allows you to steady the ball and prevents you causing strain to your bowling hand 2 x research source grip the ball lightly if your grip is too tight you will not be able to release the ball smoothly and this will negatively impact your aim the ball should slide off your fingers with ease 3 x research source test how far your hand stretches once fingers are comfortably positioned in the holes you should be able to lightly fit a pen between the bowling ball and your hand if the pen can lightly touch your hand and the ball with ease your grip is secure don t overstretch your hands or grip bowling balls too tightly 4 x research source try the conventional grip if you are new to bowling place your thumb in the bottom hole until your knuckle and your middle and ring fingers all the way into the two adjacent holes past the second knuckle this grip is the most common grip and is favored by both beginners and mid level bowlers it gives you the most control over the ball and feels most secure while this grip allows for more control of the ball it can prevent you from rolling a hook a hook is when the ball runs down the ramp in a curve and has a better chance of hitting the bowling pins this grip is best for beginners or those using in house balls that are not specifically tailored to an individuals hands 5 x research source try the fingertip grip if you re a more advanced bowler insert your thumb all the way into the bottom hole much like the conventional grip but only insert your middle and ring fingers until the first knuckle this grip is less secure and requires greater strength however it also allows you a greater chance of hooking the ball and therefore striking all the pins this grip is best for more experienced bowlers who ideally have tailor made bowling balls that fit their hands properly 6 x research source try the semi fingertip grip when you ve mastered the previous grips place your thumb in the bottom hole until the knuckle and your middle and ring fingers into the adjacent holes until the point between the first and second knuckle this grip gives you more security than the fingertip grip but also enough flexibility to hook the ball 7 x research source this grip is for advanced bowlers who can easily maneuver the conventional grip and the fingertip grip position your fingers comfortably place your thumb into the thumb hole and remember that whatever grip you choose it should go to the knuckle your thumb should grip the sides of the thumb hole lightly lighter in fact than the finger holes 8 x research source loosen your grip a loose grip will allow your fingers to exit the ball smoothly and this will improve your aim your hands should always follow in the same direction as the ball and your elbow should follow your bowling hand 9 x research source before releasing the ball practice your swing a few times to ensure that your grip feels comfortable and consistent release the ball with a push away motion move your hands and left foot forward at the same time bringing the ball up to chest height then swing the ball backward and use this momentum to create a forward swing release your thumb from the thumb hole just before completing your forward swing this release allows for rotation and will cause your ball to hook when it approaches the pins 10 x research source at the moment your thumb releases the ball it should be pointing towards the bowling pins,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hook a bowling ball,are you a beginner looking to take that next step and improve your bowling game if you want to hook a bowling ball then all you need is to master the proper grip and technique and to follow through oh and you need some time and patience too soon enough your friends will be bowled over by your amazing skills,visualize the line you ll take across the lane depending on the lanes you bowl on this can vary greatly but let s focus on a typical house condition most of the oil is on the inside leaving roughly 8 10 boards of relatively dry lane to be used these boards can be both friend and enemy to you depending on the amount of oil and the way your ball reacts to different lane conditions you will want to line up your feet slightly to the left hand side of the lane once you get more familiar with your hook you can adjust your set up as necessary starting with your right foot on the middle dot on the approach is a good way to test how much the lanes are hooking it is important to keep your feet closely together to maintain alignment stand with your heels several inches from the foul line take the amount of steps in your approach away from the lane to determine your starting position if you have a 4 step approach take 4 steps etc you then want to aim to throw your ball at one of the arrows on the lane the easiest way to aim is to use the arrow markings or the dots that are just before the arrows on the lane for this tutorial you should start off aiming somewhere around the second arrow on the right allowing the ball to roll over this arrow move out to only a few boards from the gutter and then hook from the dry spot of the lane about 38 to 40 feet down on a house shot all the way back to the 1 3 pocket for a left hander this would be the 2nd arrow on the left and the ball would hook to the 1 2 pocket make the swing a 4 step approach is recommended though you can use as little as 1 step and as many as 8 though most steps over 4 are basically just timing steps where your ball doesn t move for a 4 step approach push off the ball on your first step stepping with your right foot first for right handed players have the ball be parallel to your ankle at the 2nd step and start to bend at your knees be at the top of your backswing by your third step bring the ball back through and release by the end of your slide with 5 steps it s basically the same thing only you ll start with your left foot instead and the ball won t move for that first step keep your arm completely straight the entire way through your swing having your arm tucked too far behind you or held too far away from your body will cause a bad angle when you release the ball it s easiest to keep your arm straight if you adjust your push away there are many different styles like bending at the waist a la walter ray williams jr or wes malott or opening your shoulders a la tommy jones or chris barnes when you bring your arm up for the backswing but sticking to the basics is a good idea when first learning how to do this remember you want the ball to hook when it gets to the dry area at the back of the lane but until it gets there the ball should be traveling a relatively straight path varying only a few boards at most again everyone has a different style and you can adjust this as you feel comfortable time your release as you begin to drop the ball out of the backswing make sure that your palm is directly underneath the ball facing upwards now as the ball starts to approach your ankle you want to rotate the ball so that when you release your hand it is on the side of the ball and slightly under it just as if you were holding a football to throw an underhand spiral then follow through as though you were going to be shaking hands with the pins 1 x research source a good way to practice this technique is to actually throw an underhand spiral with a football similar physics are involved you can also practice with a tennis ball if you get it right it ll go straight and then bounce drastically to the side follow through just as important as the release itself is following through with your arm after you let go of the ball after release it is important to follow through outward onto the lane not upward your fingers will create the upward lift without you having to lift upward on the ball 2 x research source an easy way to remember this is the old espn advert roll the ball then answer the phone though hopefully you have better form than the guy in that commercial and remember fluidity here is essential don t do the hand shake pause slightly and then do the follow through it must all be one smooth motion a good follow through is crucial to maintaining consistent ball speed and accuracy make the necessary adjustments once you are comfortable with your release and can execute it properly on a consistent basis you can learn to adjust your footwork in tandem with your release on a house pattern you want to move the direction you are missing for a right hander if your ball hits high to the left of the headpin then try moving your feet a couple of boards to the left and keeping your target on the lane the same as before if you hit the pocket light to the right of the 3 pin try moving your feet a couple of boards to the right and keep your target the same it is important to move your target on the lane when you move your feet otherwise you may end up playing very weird angles once you become more advanced and start playing on more challenging sport lane conditions the left and right moves become more complicated and sometimes speed and hand adjustments are required get the right equipment no matter what you do if the bowling ball can t catch any friction on the lanes it s not going to hook generally you need a ball made of reactive resin or better e g particle load or newer epoxy resin cover stocks for anything but the driest of lanes these are very easy to find and can be bought at relatively little expense though resin is more expensive than urethane cover stock and will be an investment in your game 3 x research source check out your alley how oily are the lanes though most bowling centers do offer house balls they are generally plastic polyester and won t hook very much though they are good for most spares since they will travel very straight having your own plastic ball for spares spare ball and a resin ball for strikes and some spares spare ball is a good idea for any level of bowler as house balls don t usually fit your hand perfectly and won t carry pins very well use the proper grip when you re getting your ball custom fitted to your hand you want to know how you hold the ball your point of axis and how your grip lies grip the ball with the two middle fingers the middle and ring fingers of your dominant hand i e the hand you write with and place your thumb the whole way into the thumb hole 4 x research source there are 2 main types of grips conventional the middle and ring fingers are inserted up to the second knuckle this is seen in most house balls fingertip grip the same fingers are inserted only up to the first knuckle fingertip grips will give you more revs than a conventional grip and are easier to hook a new thing out these days in the bowling community are vacu grips these grips will expand and contract to your finger width this helps if you are going to bowl a lot you will find that most of the pros use a fingertip grip as it allows you to get your thumb out of the ball first allowing you to lift with your fingers creating revs on the ball have your ball s drilled correctly this is a personal thing depending on how and where you bowl so you will need to talk to your local pro shop operator for advice on this one the drilling for the ball is very important if not crucial so make sure the drilling is appropriate for the conditions you bowl on and your own physical limitations obviously it is critical that your own ball is fitted to your hand but if you purchase a ball the pro shop operator will do this as part of the cost of the drilling talk to your pro shop guy about your wants he may be able to recommend things you don t realize you need maybe a fingertip grip a lower or higher rp differential lower differential hooks on pearl or matte coverstock higher on resin or even a different ball or different weight completely,Sports-and-Fitness
how to bowl a strike,do you want to roll turkeys three strikes in a row or string strikes like the pros it is certainly within the physical capabilities of most people all you need is to find your proper starting position develop a fundamentally solid and repeating swing then practice if you are naturally athletic and reasonably proficient at repeating motions much practice may even be required watch out though bowling is addictive,determine whether you will be using a house ball or will be buying your own most people start with a house ball and house shoes as this is the cheapest option there are normally many house balls to choose from and these are supplied free of charge by the bowling alley shoes may be rented for one price which covers your entire bowling session the other option is get your own ball and have it custom fitted to your hand for your individual swing and release the fitting and drilling can often be accomplished on the spot if the resident pro is in the bowling center at the time the pro will be able to advise you on the best ball composition and weight for your skill level budget bowling style and aspirations you might be able to find a bargain ball online or in a local store but you will likely have trouble sorting all the options and should expect to pay the pro to fit you and drill the ball it is not recommended to get your ball fitted and drilled at a box store unless they specialize in sporting equipment and in particular bowling supplies if you buy from the pro shop though you will have free advice and free drilling decide on your grip if you purchase your ball you will have two basic choices the conventional grip where the middle and ring finger go into the ball up to the second joint of each finger this is the only grip option if you are using a house ball in this option a custom ball is drilled to accommodate the natural slant of your fingers in relation to each other and to the radius of the ball don t worry about this though the pro will take care of all the measurements and should make adjustments over your next few bowling sessions there should be no charge for the adjustments but ask just to be sure the fingertip grip in which the middle and ring finger go into the ball only up to the first joint the fingertip grip affords more leverage at release allowing you to put more juice on the shot that is impart more revolutions on the ball per unit time normally with a fingertip grip there will be rubberized inserts in each finger hole these afford a surer grip again the pro will set you up and should make adjustments gratis get your ball fitted and drilled if you are purchasing your ball the pro will take care of measuring your hand have the pro watch a couple of your shots that way the fit will account for your natural delivery style if you have not bowled before you might want to get a bit of instruction before showing the pro your shot if you ask the pro will give you a quick run down on the basics and get you started off on the right foot in the meantime finish reading this article to get a basic idea of the fundamental bowling swing which will get you strike after strike after strike undoubtedly the pro will offer you the opportunity to purchase a bag and recommended accessories you can purchase these on the spot or wait and see what turns up in the local thrift shops often bowling equipment shows up in good shape and you can pick up a ball for the kids and a bag for yourself really all you need at this point is a bowling ball sling also known as a buffer bag pick your bowling shoes it is mandatory that you use shoes specially designed for bowling these have medium soft rubber heels which stop you smoothly but quickly at the release point the soles are of leather and are designed to slide smoothly across the approach boards as you prepare to release your shot rental shoes are available at the desk and are normally paid for when you get your lane assignment 1 x research source if you plan to join a weekly bowling league house shoes are often included with the weekly fees ask about this if your center does not include free shoes for leagues you will save money overall by purchasing your own shoes right away they will be available in the pro shop or you can shop for bargains around town and online a word of caution about the shoes take care not to step in any liquid or spills bowling shoes are designed to slide smoothly right until the release if you step in water for example your slide will stop soon as it starts which is dangerous and may cause injury choose a house ball balls come in various weights which will likely be stamped into the balls alternatively the balls will be color coded for the color coded option the key should be posted conspicuously in the bowling center if not ask at the desk determine the proper starting weight pick a ball which seems fairly light holding the ball cradled in both hands extend your arms fully in front of your chest if you can hold the ball for only a couple of seconds without straining you have found a good starting weight if the ball wants to drop as soon as you push it away from your body the ball is too heavy try something a bit lighter if you can hold the ball at arm s length for quite some time the ball is way too light you want the heaviest ball that you can reasonably control if it is too light you will be able to jerk it this way and that during the swing and you will have inconsistent results select a ball with the proper span support the ball with your non dominant hand underneath insert the thumb of your bowling hand your dominant hand into the largest diameter hole and drape your middle finger and ring finger over the two remaining holes look for something where the crease of the second joint of both fingers is just over the edge of each hole if the finger holes are too far away and the edge of the hole falls between your first and second joint you will not be able to seat your fingers into the holes all the way the span is too great on the other hand if the span is too small the palm of your hand will not rest on the ball surface and you will necessarily adopt a pincher grip this is not a power grip and will result in a weak shot and relatively few strikes take the time to find at least one ball with a proper comfortable span for your hand if you are having a truly difficult time finding a ball of your targeted weight that has the proper span there is a strong possibility that you have picked a weight that is too heavy or light the heavier balls will normally have a larger span so you will need to look at balls that are heavier or lighter according to your needs if you are having trouble ask the bowling center staff for assistance they will help you arrive at a reasonable compromise for weight and span select the best finger hole size if you have identified several balls of the proper starting weight and span look for the one with the snuggest most comfortable finger holes typically the finger holes are drilled over large if you are finding that your fingers do not fit in the balls you have chosen a weight that is too light perhaps a kid s weight with proportionately smaller finger holes you want holes which are fairly snug but release your fingers easily 2 x research source determine your starting distance from the foul line stand with your back to the pins and your heels at the foul line take four and a half normal steps toward the scoring area and note the location where your toe tip ends generally this will be between the five round dots and the start of the approach 3 x research source if you find that your normal steps take you off of the alley your will have to start with your heels hanging a bit off the raised approach area and start with smaller steps building your pace and the length of your steps as you get closer to the foul line in this way you will avoid going over the line which stretches from gutter to gutter at the start of the gutter if you go over the foul line or any part of your body touches the lane past this line your pin fall is not counted and the pins are reset however you still lose your shot two per frame maximum but possibly three shots in the tenth frame only start with the toe of your on the board with the center dot before you start rolling strikes in every frame you ll need to figure out the best possible position from which to start your approach your non dominant foot will be whichever is opposite your bowling hand if you bowl right this will be your left foot put your left foot forward aligned just behind the center dot eventually you can adjust your starting alignment based on your natural tendencies but to start out and gauge your aim try starting in the center aim for the second arrow from the gutter on your dominant side about fifteen feet from the foul line you ll see the directional arrows that help you aim the center of the lane is generally the most oily part keeping the ball somewhat to the side is a good way to maximize your traction on the lane 4 x research source take several practice rolls to see where the ball goes bowl naturally keeping your shoulders parallel with the foul line and swinging your arm forward as straight as possible follow through when you release your hand should extend as if you were going to shake someone s hand pay careful attention to where the ball lands the pocket is the area immediately to one or the other side of the lead pin and is the area you want to hit to consistently roll strikes did you hit the pocket if so you ve found the correct starting position for your swing you ll want to align your non dominant foot with the center dot 5 x research source move in the direction of your miss if you missed right start your next throw a dot to the right of the center point if you missed left do the opposite while this may seem counter intuitive missing to one side means that your ball is hooking too early or too late keep the ball dead on by moving toward your miss after several practice throws you should be able to find your optimum starting position from which to bowl from there you can tweak your throw to improve your chances of hitting a strike every time practice your curve pro bowlers all bowl with some english or curvature on the ball because the pocket you re aiming for is somewhat on an angle the best way to hit it is to curve the ball in toward the pocket from the edge of the lane this is why you aim for an arrow to the side of the center the best way to ensure english on your throw is to maintain good handshake position on your follow through after you release the ball your hand should be up in the air as if you were going to shake the hand of the pin you re aiming toward 6 x research source find the right bowling ball using a ball that is too heavy or too light can drastically affect your accuracy experiment with balls that are slightly heavier than what feels normal and balls that are slightly lighter than you would normally use does your accuracy improve in either direction 7 x research source find the right speed firing the ball from the rocket launcher that is your bowling arm may seem like a good idea at first but it s not necessarily the most accurate way to throw extra force will often leave pins on the floor that softer and more accurate throws will pick up in general though you should throw the ball with as much force as you can throw accurately some modern alleys track the speed of your ball try to reduce the speed of your shot in small increments if you are blowing the pins off the lane slower precise pocket hits will keep the pins on the lane and allow them to mix improving your chance of clearing the deck and producing a strike adjust your grip on the bowling ball gripping too tightly particularly with the thumb can hook the ball in an inaccurate direction insert your fingers into the ball first if you ve got an appropriately fitted bowling ball they should go in as far as your big knuckle use your non bowling hand to steady the ball on your approach you ll typically want the thumb to release the ball a split second before the fingers make sure your fingernails are neat and trimmed to avoid catching on the fingerholes and throwing wonky balls,Sports-and-Fitness
how to drill a bowling ball,if you ve never purchased a brand new bowling ball before you might be surprised to learn that new balls often come without holes drilled in them if you are a serious bowler it s very important that the hole configuration on your ball fits your hand comfortably and is angled for the best grip additionally different hole configurations and depths may alter the way the ball behaves drilling new holes in a bowling ball is usually handled by a professional and in most cases that s probably the best approach however it is possible to do it yourself,choose a ball choose the bowling ball that s right for you based its weight and the materials it is made of bowling balls can be made of plastic the cheapest balls urethane reactive resin or particle each of these different materials provides differing degrees of friction power and control 1 x research source if you can it s a good idea to experiment with different types and weights of balls before selecting one once you drill a ball it s yours for good choose a hole configuration different finger hole configurations will provide differing amounts of control and power choosing the configuration that s right for you will require you to assess your own strengths and weaknesses as a bowler a conventional grip is achieved by drilling holes deep enough so that your fingers and thumb are inserted into the ball up to the second knuckle joint this is the traditional bowling alley ball configuration because it is the easiest to control it is the recommended configuration for beginners and players of moderate skill a fingertip grip is achieved by drilling holes that allow your fingers to be inserted into the ball up to the first knuckle joint this is an advanced configuration that is much harder to control but provides increased lift power and spin 2 x research source a semi fingertip grip is achieved by drilling holes that allow your fingers to be inserted into the ball between the first and second knuckle joint this is a happy medium between the grips described above and is easier to master than the fingertip grip while providing more power than the conventional grip 3 x research source there are also other types of grips such as the sarge easter grip but the three above are the most common measure your span measure the distance from the base of your thumb to the points at which the two fingers you will use to hold the ball will bend some people prefer the forefinger and middle finger while others prefer the middle finger and ring finger 4 x research source for a conventional grip this means measuring from the base of the the thumb to the second crease in the appropriate fingers 5 x research source for a fingertip grip measure to the crease closest to your fingertip using an adjustable bowling ball makes this process much more precise and is strongly recommended adjustable bowling balls have movable holes and various depths of finger inserts a bowling ball manufacturer sports and recreation store or possibly your local bowling alley probably have a measuring ball if you do not have access to an adjustable bowling ball for measuring your grip you can simply place your fingers onto the surface of your un drilled ball and mark around each finger once the placement feels comfortable this isn t as exact but it is comparable alternatively you can also measure your span using a compass or calipers keeping your fingers together and thumb out and then reducing your measurement by about 1 8 of an inch or 1 4 for a fingertip grip 6 x research source to determine the depth the holes will need to be without a measuring ball measure the distance from the edge of your span to the ends of the fingers that will be going into the holes record your measurements write down both your finger depth measurements and the distance between holes for reference when drilling decide on an angle having an angle that fits your hand is crucial for comfort and performance for example if the holes are angled forward the ball will have more lift when released because your fingers will remain inside until the last minute this is a decision you ll have to make based on what s comfortable for you as well as your individual strengths and weaknesses as a bowler clamp the ball in place place the ball into a tight clamp to ensure that it does not move during drilling if the ball moves during drilling the holes may come out uneven making the ball uncomfortable to use or difficult to control mark the ball with an erasable marker or piece of chalk mark the hole configuration placing a mark at the center of the spot you plan to drill each hole use your span measurement to assure the holes will be properly placed when bowling balls are molded they are suspended by a small rod that when removed leaves a hole that must be filled in this is called the pin you should avoid drilling through the pin as this may void your warranty and negatively affect the ball s performance make sure your nearest hole is at least an inch away from the pin the pin should be easy to locate it is usually a different color than the rest of the ball for advanced ball drillers the pin is used to determine properties of the bowling ball s core that can be used to determine the ideal location on the ball to drill finger holes depending on the qualities you want the ball to have 7 x research source this will vary from one model of ball to the next so if you want to try this you should consult the instructions that came with your ball it s a good idea to double check your marks against your span measurements before drilling once the holes are drilled they are permanent select your bits determine the correctly sized drill bits to create comfortable holes for your thumb and fingers you can determine this easily if you used a sizing ball to get your hand measurements as these balls also provide information on your thumb and finger widths if you did not have the benefit of a sizing ball a good way to determine this is to experiment with different bits drilling holes of different sizes into a block of wood and then determining which ones most comfortably fits your thumb and fingers 8 x research source insert the first bit prepare your bowling ball drill with the proper bit for your thumb width it is strongly recommended that you use a bowling ball drill attempting this with an ordinary drill may damage your ball drill your thumb hole drill the hole slowly at your desired angle checking the depth often so as not to drill too deep switch bits and drill the finger holes swap out the drill bit and drill the two finger holes as with the thumb hole check the depths often to avoid drilling too deep sand the holes replace the drill bit with a sanding attachment and sand the interior of the holes until they are smooth and our fingers slide in and out easily and comfortably,Sports-and-Fitness
how to clean a bowling ball,a built up layer of oil on your ball can cause it to react differently with the lane this often causes your ball to lose grip on the lane which can hurt your throw however you can easily remove this oil with a little bit of time and some household products using these products you can clean your ball at home deep clean it at home or you could take it to a pro shop and have it cleaned with an oil extraction machine,prevent the buildup of oil for easier cleaning when the oil is fresh on your ball it ll be easiest to wipe away wipe your ball after every game to maintain its condition keep a ball towel with your bowling gear for this purpose and change it out after every time you play so oil doesn t build up on the cloth and transfer again to the ball your ball towel ideally should be a lint free microfiber cloth microfiber cloths will protect the finish of your ball and lint free cloth will keep threads and pieces of cloth from rubbing onto your ball and influencing your game for the best results and the most consistent throws towel off your ball after every shot during prolonged play you may want to swap in a clean towel at about the halfway point in your play 1 x research source moisten your rag with rubbing alcohol 2 x research source as soon as you finish bowling the ball will be warm from the friction of the lane this heat opens the pores on your ball allowing you to clean the ball better 3 x research source a little bit of alcohol goes a long way so use it sparingly to wet your rag then wipe down the entire surface of your ball after you have wiped down your ball with your alcohol dampened cloth take a dry part of your towel or a fresh towel and wipe free any remaining moisture on its surface clean the ball regularly the longer the oil sits on the surface of your ball the more a chance it has to sink in and become harder to remove this means that by cleaning your ball every time you bowl your ball will stay cleaner for longer 4 x research source this can save you a considerable amount in professional cleaning and help you bowl more consistently wait until you ve bowled a significant number of games this kind of deep cleaning is known among bowlers and pros as pulling the oil out of the ball basically this removes oil that has sunk deep into the pores of your ball over the course of many games the number of games you should wait before deep cleaning will depend entirely on how frequently you play and the lanes you play on when playing on oily lanes regularly you may want to have the oil pulled from your ball every 50 games better regulated lanes might only require your ball to be deep cleaned every 70 100 games when you start noticing the action of your ball on the lane to change it s probably time for a deep cleaning 5 x research source tape up the finger holes on your bowling ball you ll want to use a waterproof tape to do this water that gets into the finger holes of your ball can harm its performance apply the tape over the holes and smooth it so it is flat and there are no gaps in the tape to ensure that no water gets into your finger holes you may want to use an additional piece of tap per hole fill a bucket with hot water and insert your ball oil is lighter than water so it and any accompanying dirt will lift from the surface of your ball when soaked in warm water to allow the water enough time to work into the pores of your ball soak your ball for 20 minutes remove your ball take off its tape and dry it after your ball is finished soaking it should be mostly clean to prevent water on the surface of your ball from dripping into finger holes keep the tape on the ball and use a clean lint free towel or rag to dry the ball when the ball is mostly dry remove the tape and dry it again to remove any remaining moisture take your ball to your local pro shop even if you re a pro bowler it s unlikely that you ll have a specialized ball cleaning machine of your own these machines are essentially tanks of water that heat to open the pores of the ball and remove deeply entrenched oil you should be able to find one of these machines at most bowling pro shops 6 x research source have a pro shop employee clean your ball this service is usually relatively inexpensive and having a professional clean and polish your ball all but ensures a thorough cleaning beyond that your pro will be able to point out damage that you might otherwise not have noticed 7 x research source plan for the wait time until the ball is clean the time it takes your pro shop to clean your ball may vary but you can generally expect ball cleaning to take about an hour and a half if you have a spare ball this is just enough time for you to squeeze a few games in 8 x research source alternatively you could run errands tackle some chores read a book or play a handheld game while you re waiting this way you re not bored while your ball is cleaned bowl like a champion now that your ball is cleaned and polished it should have regained the same lane reaction as it did originally continue to wipe your ball with a towel after throws and clean it after every game to maintain its condition,Sports-and-Fitness
how to bowl with reactive bowling balls,one of the most celebrated advancements in modern bowling equipment is the reactive bowling ball unlike normal bowling balls which are covered in polyurethane or dense plastic reactive balls are coated with a layer of grippy resin this increases the ball s traction on the lane and gives the bowler more control over the speed and angle of the throw 1 x research source most high level bowlers take advantage of this added traction by throwing hook shots which tend to result in more strikes because of their rotation and angle of entry if you ve been trying to improve your bowling game getting a feel for a reactive bowling ball will allow you to pull off shots that would have before been unimaginable,insert your fingers into the ball if you re right handed slide the middle and ring fingers of your hand hand into the upper two finger holes if you re left handed insert the fingers of your left hand the finger holes should come to a stop right around the first knuckle this grip will be most effective for bowling precise angles 2 x research source using any other fingers won t permit you to keep the ball centered in your hand select a ball that doesn t force you to stretch your hand there should be enough room between your palm and the surface of the ball to fit a pencil 3 x research source use your other hand to steady the ball place your non bowling hand flat against the opposite side of the ball you ll use this hand to steady the ball as you initiate the swing relying too heavily on the movement of your bowling hand can cause the ball to sway before the moment of release this will throw off your shot your support hand should remain on the ball until just before you roll remove your thumb from the ball rest your thumb flat against the outside of the ball to get it out of the way unlike a conventional roll where the thumb guides the ball during release a proper hook shot requires the ball to be able to rotate slightly 4 x research source imagine that you re cupping the ball with your thumb rather than pressing against it tuck the ball against your wrist as you raise it behind you to help stabilize it hold the ball loosely keep your wrist straight but relaxed to bowl a strike with a hook shot it s critical that you release the ball at exactly the right time and position if you re too tense you re more likely to neutralize the rotation of the roll or miss entirely 5 x research source try not to bring your arm out too far to the side the ball should move within a few inches of your support leg when you bowl line up your body with the pins before you roll make sure your stance is squared up and your head is facing forward bend your knees slightly to give yourself a solid base any shifting or tilting of the feet waist or shoulders will rob your shot of accuracy 6 x research source start straight and finish straight remember that the angle of the shot depends largely on the angle of your body take a few steps toward the fault line glide smoothly into each step keeping your head level as you travel forward raise the ball to face level then bring it down and back behind you as you prepare to release the ball lower your hips and lean your upper body downward to put you closer to the lane 7 x research source let the ball s natural momentum carry it through the swing don t force it most experienced bowlers take 4 5 steps during their approach any more than this may overcomplicate your throw and take your focus away from your technique 8 x research source flick your finger slightly as the ball leaves your hand just before releasing the ball curl your middle and ring fingers together upward and to the side the motion of these two fingers is responsible for generating rotation right handed bowlers should turn the ball just slightly toward the left before it makes contact with the lane left handed bowlers will twist the ball to the right your fingers should just graze the edges of the holes on their way out when you re first learning to roll a hook keep your rotation minimal as you get accustomed to the motion you can work on making your angles wider and your arc more pronounced follow through for greater accuracy continue extending your bowling arm forwards and upwards even after the ball has left your hand this will ensure that you don t pull back too soon and choke the ball s momentum finish the roll with your arm at about chest level as though you were accepting a handshake 9 x research source a good follow through is critical for a fast accurate roll if your bowling arm is pointed downward at the lane when you complete your roll you re not following through enough line the ball up near the edge of the lane in order for the ball to strike near the middle of the pins following a curved hook you ll need to make sure it begins its path on the far side of the lane as it travels down the lane the inward rotation will cause it to pull in the opposite direction moving it closer to the center 10 x research source approach from the side of the lane rather than trying to reach with your bowling arm try to keep the ball inside the outermost arrow printed on the lane otherwise it may accidentally spiral into the gutter 11 x research source make a clean release keep your head up and your eyes on the pins as you complete your roll let the ball leave your hand in one smooth motion making sure to withdraw your fingers from the holes quickly so that they don t get in the way take care not to drop or fling the ball it should fall no more than an inch or two before making contact with the lane 12 x research source the lower your stance and angle of your upper body the closer your bowling arm will be to the lane because of the increased friction created by the shell of reactive bowling balls it s even more important that your release be seamless 13 x research source target the point between the first and second or third pins when the ball enters from this sweet spot it creates a sweeping action that knocks over the pins in the direction that they re spaced this is a much more efficient path than bowling straight on which often leaves surrounding pins untouched 14 x research source if you re a right handed bowler the ball should enter right between the first and third pins the pin in the front and the one just behind it to the right left handed bowlers should aim between the first and second pins the oblique angle and rotation force of a hook shot makes it easier to clear pins even if your aim is off by a little bit learn to increase the amount of rotation you put on the ball the rotation you apply to the ball allows it to strike the pins at a precise angle and with greater force but it also makes you more likely to miss start by throwing slight curves then work your way toward more exaggerated hooks after you ve refined your control over the ball you ll be able to bowl strikes and spares effortlessly 15 x research source the rotation should come from the movement of your fingers not your wrist arm or shoulder rolls with more rotation need to be counterbalanced by a faster speed to avoid curving off the

how to use a finger bowl,in the past finger bowls were commonly used prior to dessert as a means of cleaning your fingers now they are only rarely used during formal multi course meals despite being uncommon today understanding the etiquette is important during dinner interviews and helpful at restaurants that still partake in this unique tradition,place your new clean napkin under your used one each finger bowl comes with a clean napkin folded in half place the new napkin underneath the one you used during previous courses 1 x research source when you need to wipe your fingers always do so with the top napkin dip the tips of the fingers of one hand into the warm water move them around gently but avoid swirling them harshly you just want to get them wet 2 x research source as you dip your fingers in the water hold your free hand in between the 2 napkins on your lap wipe your fingers gently onto the used napkin raise the used napkin slightly with your hand and dry your wet fingers with the napkin take care to bring your fingers down to the napkin as opposed to moving the napkin to your fingers when cleaning your fingers your napkin should never be visible to other guests at the table repeat the process with the fingertips of your opposite hand hold the hand you finished cleaning in between the napkins on your lap after dipping your other hand into the water bring it down to the napkin and gently dry your fingers always bring your fingers to the napkin never the other way around fold the used top napkin loosely and place it to the left of your plate once you have wet and dried the fingers on both of your hands loosely fold the top napkin and place it onto the left of your plate you should now have your clean napkin on your lap ready for your dessert 3 x research source after placing the napkin onto the left side of your food plate a server will take it away when they come with dessert grasp the finger bowl and place it to the top left area of your place setting if your finger bowl came with a doily a piece of lace paper that acts as an ornamental mat grab it along with your bowl be sure to place your bowl and doily to the left as the right side of your place setting is reserved for coffee if you don t know where to place the bowl look for the area where your bread plate was located prior to being cleared by the server for dessert set your fork and spoon beside your plate if you haven t already if your fork and spoon are not already in their proper positions they should be in front of you place the fork onto the table to the left of your plate and the spoon onto the table to the right of your plate 4 x research source your doily and bowl should now be resting above your fork,Sports-and-Fitness
how to pick a bowling ball,the modern bowling ball is much more high tech and individualized than it was twenty years ago different balls have extremely different levels of performance and the differences are often highly technical even more complicated there isn t t even one best type of ball each ball is designed for a different type of player,pick a comfortable weight bowling balls come in a variety of weights ranging from 6 pounds 2 7 kg to 16 pounds 7 3 kg choose a ball that is heavy enough for you to effectively roll down the bowling lane without straining yourself heavier is not necessarily better remember you will be tossing the ball two dozen times and what seems like a comfortable weight at first might not be so comfortable by the end of the night for practice try swinging a weight at home in much the same way that you would swing a bowling ball if after 23 times your arm is tired that weight level is too high for you you want to have full use of arm strength through the duration of the game as a general rule you should be able to handle a bowling ball around 10 of your own body weight unfortunately the poor grip quality of house balls at bowling alleys can make tossing these more strenuous when working with a ball not specifically fitted to you it might be necessary to use a lighter ball 1 x research source find a ball that fits your fingers each bowling ball has holes for your thumb middle finger and ring finger pick a ball with holes that allow your fingers to be inserted and removed freely without being so loose that you lose control of the ball find a ball for which the distance between the holes span is comfortable for you try out several balls until you have a fit that feels comfortable 2 x research source for house balls the size of the holes typically correlates with the weight on the ball heavier bowling balls feature larger holes whereas lighter balls feature smaller holes the limited range of options can make it difficult to find a ball that has the right weight and finger parameters for you but you should keep on trying until you find the best fit when purchasing your own ball the pro shop should customize the span and finger holes to the size of your hand any quality store should fit a ball precisely to your needs without much effort on your part a pro shop should also sell finger inserts which can be useful when using other people s balls these can be transferred from one ball to another to improve your grip and give all of your balls a consistent feel these have become very popular in recent years 3 x research source choose between a right handed or left handed bowling ball the only difference between the two is that the ring finger is drilled 1 8 inch 3 175 mm further from the thumb hole on a left handed ball the majority of balls available for rental at bowling alleys are right handed balls if you want to use a left handed ball you may need to specifically request one choose between speed and hook if you have trouble getting the ball down the lane at high speeds certain ball types can improve your speed though it will be at the expense of your hook as a rule balls that are shinier produce less friction and thus can move faster balls that have a dull appearance produce more friction and thus are easier to hook 4 x research source to hook a ball is to cause it to swing to the right or the left after tossing it this creates the optimal trajectory for a strike but it is a technique that typically only skilled bowlers can perform correctly urethane balls are good for players who want to increase speed but retain some hook in their throw resin reactive and particle balls are better for grip and hook than speed these are good for experts who have built up a good ball speed and now want to master their hook plastic balls are good for beginners because they tend to go straight without losing control they are not optimal however for either speed or hook 5 x research source at a pro shop balls made of any substance can be polished to reduce friction thus increasing speed and decreasing hook 6 x research source 60 80 of a ball s performance depends upon its coverstock the hard exterior this is the most important customizable feature of the ball pick a ball with the right core for your hook next to the cover the most important feature of a bowling ball is its core the heavier the core the quicker the ball will begin to hook a lighter core will cause the ball to hook further down the lane there is no best core just the core that fits throw core design varies significantly from one ball to another making it a complex issue you should talk to an employee at the pro shop about the core design of any ball that you are interested in 7 x research source the core is an area inside the ball that offsets the weight imbalance created by the finger holes because this is inside the ball you can t actually see it and it can be difficult to understand what effect it has on your throw that is why it is important to consult a professional about the core of your ball pick an appropriate ball for lane conditions determine whether your bowling lane is dry or oily this will help you decide whether to pick a polished or rough ball an oily lane will cause more skidding and if your ball has begun to skid out of control you should switch to a ball that is less polished resin reactive and particle balls have the grip necessary for oiled lanes 8 x research source there is no easy way to determine how the lane is oiled you can ask the staff but often your only real recourse is to toss the ball a few times and see how it skids typically lanes will be oiled unevenly often they are oiled more around the center than the edges this will help the ball retain control before sliding into the gutter sometimes the lane is oiled more in the front than the back of the lane causing the ball to skid earlier thus whether you switch to a ball that produces more friction should also be determined by whether the position of the oil is throwing off your game wipe down your ball before every throw if your lane is oily use a dry towel to wipe your ball select a color bowling balls are available in a wide variety of colors some balls are available in multiple colors swirl patterns or even glow in the dark designs the color of a ball won t physically affect how the ball travels but a ball that makes you proud can give you the confidence you need to play a better game 9 x research source look no further than the alley the house balls at the bowling alley are not high performance balls specifically it is very difficult to get a hooked throw using one of these however these balls can be good for beginners because they have a lot of control and are good for straight line throws if you re starting out and don t want to spend a lot of money these can be an excellent choice even experts will occasionally throw the sort of polyester balls that are used as the house balls at bowling allies specifically professional will use them for picking up spares because when doing that an accurate straight shot is typically preferable to a hook similarly if you re still struggling to keep the ball out of the gutter these are probably the best balls for you 10 x research source imitate other bowlers when you watch bowling pay attention to what professionals are using at the alley talk to some of the better bowlers about their bowling ball choice be particularly mindful of the choices of a bowler who has a style similar to yours the issue with this technique is that there isn t one best ball on the market finding the right ball is about finding one that fits your physique and style so following someone else s lead will only work if you have similar styles alternatively you can also ask bowlers what shop they got their ball at this might be the most relevant piece of information because the pro shop will be responsible for fitting your ball to your hands and should give you a lot of advice about what type fits your style ask around for a shop with knowledgeable staff possibly even employees who were themselves professional bowlers find a good pro shop ask other bowlers and look online for a bowling shop with highly knowledgeable staff many shops will employee staff members who were themselves either successful professional or semi professional bowlers because bowling balls have become so technologically advanced over recent years it is important to have expert advice the pro shop will also customize your grip which can be one of the most important elements for achieving a quality game as late as the 1980s most bowling balls were fairly standardized today bowling balls have different textures and core types which have a substantial impact on play style you should seek expert assistance when determining what type fits your style best 11 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to practice proper bowling etiquette,proper bowling etiquette is important for many reasons first off it helps make the game a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved whether you are just having fun with friends or on a league second it helps keep everyone and everything safe read this article if you d like to know how you can have proper bowling etiquette next time you go out bowling,wear bowling shoes at all times while in the bowler s area if you wear street shoes you risk ruining the approaches and or the equipment when you are putting your bowling shoes on be sure that you move them as far away from walkways as possible to avoid anyone tripping on them if your street shoes are wet or dirty be sure that you take them off as far away from the lanes as possible if you track water mud or anything else onto the lanes then you run the risk of you or someone else falling flat on their face avoid eating or drinking while on the bowler s area something as simple as a drop of water could easily create a big hazard eat or drink either at a seating area that is usually located behind the general bowling area or simply just away from all of the lanes avoid swearing or shouting even if you were really upset about a missed strike remember that especially if you are at an open bowling session and there are families with children there they can likely hear you and it may cause them to be uncomfortable stay off of the approach unless it is your turn if it is not your turn either go to the seating area behind you or step out of any bowlers ways this can be an annoyance especially if they were in the middle of throwing their ball and you walked in front of them make sure that you have permission to use another person s ball if for whatever reason you need to use it ask them politely and make sure that you have a good reason if they end up saying no respect that and move on if you need to use another person s ball because your ball is stuck then simply let the next bowler on your lane know their ball may hit it or theirs may become stuck too if their ball becomes stuck too go up to a worker and tell them that you have a couple of bowling balls that are stuck it may take awhile to get them back but it may also avoid someone from becoming upset that their ball was used be ready to take your turn immediately most likely there are other bowlers on your lane who would like to bowl too therefore when it is your turn be sure you are walking up to the area immediately to avoid keeping everyone waiting if you need to use the bathroom try and time it out so you have a minute before your turn and go as quick as possible if you feel comfortable doing so you can also designate someone to bowl for you if you do not come back in time so that no one is kept waiting wait until the pin setting machine has finished its entire cycle and the sweep bar is lifted completely before you bowl while you should be ready to bowl immediately when it is your turn wait until that short process is complete because failing to do so could result in you damaging equipment or your ball and it may also result in your ball getting stuck 1 x research source avoid stepping over the foul line it is dangerous to do so because it can result in you getting oil on the approach which can be dangerous for anyone who is walking on it 2 x research source avoid throwing your ball down the wrong lane although you will likely be told if you are about to throw your ball down the wrong lane you may not be therefore it is important that you pay attention to which lane you are on at all times because if you throw your ball down the wrong lane the game will likely be delayed because the score will have to be changed step away from the approach immediately when your turn is finished this will immediately open up the approach so that someone else can bowl right away and it won t unnecessarily delay the game recognize that the bowler on the right is given priority if it is your turn and you as well as the person to the right of you are ready to bowl at the same time let them go first step off of the approach and wait patiently for them to finish,Sports-and-Fitness

how to improve your bowling scores for advanced players,how often do you go bowling with your buddies and find that your scores don t quite match up to theirs do you already love the game but are interested in improving your scores if so this guide is for you,if you use a reactive or particle bowling ball and the reaction is not enough try scooting one or two boards to the right keep the same target if you are left handed try moving over one or two boards to the left if the reaction is too much and your ball is over spinning move one or two boards over to the left again keeping the same target if you are left handed move one or two boards to the right if you have no idea what you are doing wrong then have a friend film one or two of your shots with a mobile phone or a small camera then after you have finished your shot watch it over and over until you can figure out what you are doing wrong see if you can t improve your next shot if you are finding that you are leaving a lot of corner pins hitting the pocket and ringing the 10 righty 7 lefty keep everything the same but move one board to the left right to create more angle and this will kick it out if you require more hook you can always cup your wrist this will take time to get used to as you need to quickly go from loaded cupped wrist to unloaded uncupped back to loaded in a split second at the point of release also you could change the angle of your wrist straight almost 90 deg to the inside so left for right handers and right for lefties this will give you maximum side roll and will arc the ball off the break point the lower angle the less side roll and more up the back of the ball you will be practice hitting a mark most bowlers use the arrows for marks but others like to use the dots once you have a mark practice throwing over it remember to not look at the pins until your ball crosses over the mark play a game with yourself and see how many times in a row you can hit your mark give coaching a shot the most recommended type of bowling coach is a usbc certified coach your local bowling center should have information on where to find one join a league this is probably the most practical way to improve your game most leagues are usbc certified and require you to bowl three games once a week but most bowling centers also have just for fun leagues if you re not the competitive type call your local bowling center to get information on the leagues they offer the most advanced and best way to improve your scores is practice remember only you the bowler can improve your game that s why bowling is an individual sport if you re serious about improving your scores you will need to practice at least three times a week,Sports-and-Fitness
how to roll a bowling ball,you grab your ball you square up with the lane you lock your eyes on the pins you take one step then another then another you ease the ball up behind you and let it swing back down like a pendulum in what feels like a perfect arc you watch as the ball creeps straight into the gutter what happened rolling a bowling ball isn t as easy as it looks but with a solid understanding of basic technique and a little practice you ll be knocking them down in no time,pick out a ball that s roughly 10 of your body weight bowling balls range in weight from 6 16 pounds 2 7 7 3 kg if you re smaller in stature or don t have much experience bowling it s best to start with a lighter ball that you can move around with ease until you get the hang of the basic technique 1 x research source if you weight 140 pounds 64 kg for example you would select a 14 lb 6 4 kg ball to practice with heavier balls hit with more force but they can be difficult to swing and maneuver on the flipside lighter balls are easier to manipulate and roll faster but tend to give up some accuracy 2 x research source insert your middle finger ring finger and thumb into the holes in the ball take hold of the ball with your dominant hand this is generally the one that you ll be more coordinated with slide your fingers in as far as they ll comfortably go and gently squeeze the edges of the holes 3 x research source don t jam your fingers in too far there s a chance that they could get stuck especially if you re using a ball that s on the smaller side this is known as a conventional grip centering the ball on your hand in this way keeps it evenly balanced and allows for straighter more precise shots grip the ball loosely with your dominant hand try not to clutch the finger holes like you re holding on for dear life keep your hand firm but relaxed using only enough pressure as it takes to maintain a good connection with the ball 4 x research source the more tense your hand is the more trouble you ll have getting a nice smooth release for the sake of your toes you don t want your grip to be too loose either use your free hand to help support the ball place your palm flat against the side of the ball close to the bottom edge this hand is there to steady the ball during your approach it will also share the load so your bowling arm doesn t get fatigued as quickly 5 x research source always use a two handed grip when carrying your ball from the return to the lane as well as to and from the rack where you originally got it stand on the approach area and line your body up with the center of the lane the approach area is the open space just past the ball return where you ll make your walk up it serves as a kind of starting point where you can gather up the momentum you need to send the ball down to the far end of the lane where the pins await 6 x research source if you re right handed it may help to stand slightly left of the midpoint of the lane so that your ball doesn t travel too far to the right if you re left handed shift over to the right the lane is the oiled strip of wood that you actually roll the ball down 7 x research source raise the ball up until it s poised just under your chin keep it in this position until you re ready to initiate your swing this serves two purposes firstly it allows you to sight the pins over the top of the ball secondly it prevents the ball from bumping into your legs during your walk up hold the ball as close to your body as you can to make its weight more manageable take 3 4 fluid steps towards the lane start with the foot on the same side of your body as your bowling arm for traditional 4 step approach if you think you might be more comfortable with a short 3 step approach lead with the foot opposite your bowling arm instead 8 x research source most bowling instructors and pros recommend a basic 4 step approach but you can add or subtract a step if you like what matters most is that the movement feels natural be careful not to cross the foul line by accident if you do so during an actual game your shot won t count no matter how many pins you manage to topple 9 x research source coordinating your steps will ensure that you end up in a balanced stance upon your release swing the ball back behind you as you move closer to the pins on your first or second step lower the ball down from its ready position and let it travel back up and slightly out to the side continue lifting it until it s roughly at shoulder height from there you ll be ready to uncork a thunderous strike 10 x research source ideally your walk up and your swing should flow together as one continuous motion each action should start and end at the same time keep your eyes on the pins at all times zero in on the center pin to give yourself a wide margin of error for your shot you re essentially relying on hand eye coordination here to carry the ball from one end of the lane to the other with as little deviation as possible 11 x research source don t overthink your aim just focus on your form and let the rest happen on its own once you start to get a feel for your technique you can begin using the target arrows painted on the lane for reference adjusting your release for a slightly closer target will improve your accuracy 12 x research source lower your weight on the last step of your approach to get closer to the lane plant both feet firmly bend the knee of your support leg and lean forward at the waist slightly make sure your hips stay under your shoulders so that your whole body remains in alignment 13 x research source the foot opposite your bowling arm should be in front of you as you begin your release getting low will put you in a better position to release the ball just above the surface of the lane as opposed to dropping or chucking it from higher up that way it won t come crashing down heavily which can kill the momentum you ve built up curl your wrist inward or outward to compensate for varying lane conditions in most cases keeping the wrist of your bowling arm firm and straight is the key to a solid shot if the lane is freshly oiled however loading the ball by curving your wrist towards your forearm just a tad will allow you to cup the ball more firmly and give you a little more control similarly you can unload the ball by bending your wrist back to create more snap when the lane looks especially dry 15 x research source loading and unloading both require subtle changes in technique if your wrist is bent more than about 45 degrees in either direction you may just sabotage your own shot it s good to get in the habit of inspecting the lane up close before you start your first game just like in golf the conditions of your playing surface can have a huge influence on the way you bowl 16 x research source let the ball slip off your fingers as it comes parallel with the lane simply uncurl your top two fingers and allow the momentum of your swing to carry the ball away from your hand a delicate release will guarantee the smoothest possible transition to the lane 17 x research source as your thumb leaves its hole point it in the direction that you want the ball to go to help steer it a bit 18 x research source continue extending your bowling arm upwards for greater speed and precision rather than dropping your arm as soon as you release the ball keep following through to generate even more power end your throw with your hand over your head palm facing towards you 19 x research source if an exaggerated follow through feels awkward aim to finish with your arm at around waist level as though you were reaching out to shake someone s hand don t alter your stance or posture until the ball has left your hand completely as the slightest shift could throw off your shot try out a fingertip grip if the ball is getting stuck on your fingers the fingertip grip is almost identical to the standard conventional grip instead of sliding your middle and ring fingers all the way into the holes though only insert them up to the first knuckle a shallower grip will ensure that the ball has no difficulty leaving your hand 20 x research source in general it takes more finger strength to hold and manipulate the ball with a fingertip grip than with a conventional grip 21 x research source the fingertip grip is considered an advanced technique which means that it may make it harder for you to bowl accurately if you haven t yet mastered the conventional grip learn to throw a hook when you get comfortable with straight shots if your goal is to score big you ll eventually need to advance to the hook shot to throw an effective hook rotate your wrist inward sharply at the moment of release if you do this just right the circular motion will cause the ball to curve in a gentle arc 22 x research source the straight shot is the first technique that every bowler learns but its use is somewhat limited in competitive play since it s prone to creating splits or areas where the pins are separated by a gap splits can be tough to pick up even for experienced bowlers adding the hook shot to your repertoire is a must if you want to be able to bowl strikes consistently the curved ball path gives you access to the pocket or the sweet spot between the 1 pin and 2 or 3 pin where all 10 pins are most likely to fall if struck hard enough 23 x

how to tell the difference between a kayak and canoe,for people new to water sports the difference between a canoe and kayak can be quite confusing canoes and kayaks are both normally lightweight boats propelled and controlled by people using paddles but each boat is unique in its own way while both can be used for recreation as well as water sports fishing and traveling there are a few key differences to look out for when distinguishing one from the other,learn the basic classifications canoes and kayaks are classified by letters and numbers the letter refers to the type of boat being used and the number refers to the number of paddlers in the boat while there are various kinds of canoes and kayaks for different water activities water conditions and skill levels the boat classifications generally stick to a common letter and number system for example a typical canoe with one paddler would be defined as c1 solo a canoe with two paddlers would be defined as c2 tandem 1 x research source while typical canoes have an open deck meaning the top of the boat and consequently the inside of the boat is open to the elements some canoes used in competitions or harsher water conditions can have a closed cockpit therefore altering the classifications in this example a typical canoe could be classified as oc1 whereas the closed cockpit canoe could be classified as c1 2 x research source a solo kayak would be signified by k1 whereas a tandem kayak would be k2 and k4 would signify a four person crew note the differences in purpose in the recreational boating world canoes tend to be the pickup truck whereas kayaks are tend to be more like a sports car metaphorically speaking canoes are considered practical versatile and easily manageable these features make canoes great for leisure paddling with family on relatively calm water kayaks on the other hand normally carry fewer people and they can usually travel faster than canoes which is why they are favored for competitive and challenging water conditions note the differences in design as mentioned earlier typical canoes normally have an open deck whereas kayaks normally have a closed deck the differences in the two decks are essentially obvious open decks expose the top and inside of the boat to the world while closed decks cover the top and inside of the boat accordingly a canoe with an open deck gives the paddler s the opportunity to move freely whereas a kayak with a closed deck surrounds the paddler s and provides protection and secure seating 3 x research source for rougher water like sea kayaking or white water class 3 and above the enclosed deck combined with a spray skirt is significantly beneficial a spray skirt is a covering material that surrounds the paddlers to help keep water out from the inside of the boat 4 x research source note the differences in seating positions paddlers in a canoe normally sit one of two ways sitting or kneeling when sitting the canoe paddler sits on a seat and places their knees against the top edge and rim of the boat when kneeling the canoe paddler positions themselves closer to the front of the seating and wedges their knees against the sides of the boat for stability paddlers in kayaks usually sit lower to the hull bottom of the boat in a cockpit and have their legs stretched forward inside the kayak with their knees resting on supportive thigh braces note the differences of the paddles in a canoe the paddler typically uses a single blade paddle 5 x research source kayak paddlers usually use double bladed paddles because kayak paddlers are generally seated lower than canoe paddlers with their seated position just above the waterline as opposed to sitting way above the waterline in a canoe a single paddle doesn t provide efficient propelling some advantages to using a double bladed paddle are its easy to learn technique and its quicker pace 6 x research source some advantages to using a single blade paddle are energy conservation and minimizing zigzagging in the water 7 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to canoe,if you ve never canoed before you might be worried about not being able to steer the boat or even tipping it over fortunately these problems can easily be avoided by learning how to paddle by getting in and out of the boat properly with a paddle a life jacket and a good partner you ll be ready to have an enjoyable canoeing experience that hopefully won t end with you in the water,pack the canoe close to the water that way you won t have to carry a heavy canoe to the launching point put lighter items in the front and back of the canoe pack heavy items at the center of the canoe make sure everything is securely in place so it doesn t shift during your trip 1 x research source tightly pack things under the seats in the canoe to help keep them from shifting when you re on the water designate a bowman and a sternman the bowman sits in the front of the canoe and the sternman sits in the back make whoever wants to be on look out duty the bowman the sternman will be responsible for steering the canoe the bowman should alert the sternman of any obstacles in the water so the sternman can steer the canoe around them the sternman is responsible for letting the bowman know when to switch sides with their paddle put on a life jacket it s important you wear a life jacket any time you re canoeing make sure your life jacket fits properly it should feel snug when you put it on never put a child in an adult sized life jacket if you re canoeing with children make sure they have child sized life jackets that fit them snugly 2 x research source secure the canoe before you get in if you re launching off a dock tie both ends of the canoe to the dock using a rope if you re launching off a shoreline have your partner hold the canoe steady while you get in get into the canoe carefully bend your knees and grab onto the side of the canoe closest to you set one of your legs into the center of the canoe and grab onto the far side of the boat with your hand carefully bring your other leg into the canoe if you re the bowman sit on the bench at the front of the boat push off to launch the canoe if you re launching from a dock untie the canoe from the dock once the bowman and sternman are both in carefully push off from the dock with your hand or paddle if you re launching from shore the sternman will need to push off as they re getting in so the canoe goes into the water 3 x research source to launch from shore start with the front of the canoe in the water and the back of the canoe up on land once the bowman is seated the sternman should place one leg in the canoe then the sternman should push off with their other leg as they bring it into the boat 4 x research source hold the paddle so your inside hand is on top your inside hand is your hand furthest from the side of the boat you re paddling on your other hand should be positioned around 2 3 feet 0 6 0 9 meters down from the top of the paddle for example if you re paddling on the left side of the boat your right hand would be your inside hand you would hold the top of the paddle with your right hand and your left hand would be lower on the paddle insert the end of the paddle into the water in front of you you want to bring the end of the paddle as far in front of you as you can without having to get up from your seat for example if you re supposed to be paddling on the left side of the canoe you would insert the paddle into the water in front of you to the left of the boat 5 x research source bring the paddle back in a smooth sweeping motion the end of the paddle should remain underwater push with your top hand and pull back with your bottom hand to move the paddle backward when the paddle is behind you and you can t go back any further lift it out of the water and gently swing it back around in front of you to where you first put it in the water repeat the process to move the canoe forward paddle on the opposite side of the canoe your partner s paddling on this will keep you on a straight course and prevent the canoe from going in circles for example if the bowman is paddling on the left side of the canoe the sternman should be paddling on the right paddle in sync with the other person both of your paddles should be going in and out of the water at the same time the bowman at the front of the canoe should set the pace and the sternman should adjust their paddling to match them use a j stroke to steer the boat a j stroke is a small backward stroke through the water if you want the canoe to go left the sternman should do a j stroke on the left side of the canoe to go right the sternman would do a j stroke on the right side of the canoe the larger the backward stroke the sternman does the more drastic of a turn the canoe will make do a draw to make a hard turn a draw is when you extend a paddle out away from the boat holding it vertically so just the flat end of the paddle is in the water then you pull the paddle in toward the edge of the boat if you ever need to make a sharp turn both the bowman and sternman should do a draw on opposite sides of the canoe to make a hard left turn the sternman should draw on the right side of the canoe to make a hard right turn the sternman should draw on the left side of the canoe don t panic if you tip the canoe if you tip over tuck the paddles and any of your belongings under the seats in the flipped canoe holding on to the canoe swim toward the nearest shore if you re canoeing in a river with a strong current don t try to swim against the current hold on to the canoe if you can and wait for the current to slow down so you can swim to shore if you re far from shore try flipping the canoe over with your partner it helps if you both get under the flipped canoe and lift it up with your arms before you try flipping it paddle toward a landing point if you re landing on shore steer the canoe so the front is pointed at the shoreline if you re landing at a dock turn the canoe so it s parallel with the side of the dock slow down as you approach the landing point 6 x research source land the canoe gently on shore or at a dock when you re landing a canoe on shore the front of the canoe should gently go up onto the land and the back of the canoe should remain in the water to land at a dock get as close to the side of the dock as possible so the side of the canoe is parallel with the side of the dock steady the canoe before you get out if you re landing at a dock tie the front and back ends of the boat to the dock with rope if you re landing on shore have the bowman hold the canoe steady 7 x research source get out of the canoe one at a time decide who s going to get out first and let that person get completely out of the boat before you do anything else if you re getting off on shore the bowman should get out of the canoe first so they can hold it steady for the sternman keep your body low and centered in the canoe and step out with one foot first after you ve steadied yourself lift your other foot out of the boat 8 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to paddle a canoe,with its slim tapering design and open top the canoe hasn t changed much since its invention by the indigenous people of north america yet it s still one of the most popular boating choices for casual paddlers and serious enthusiasts alike 1 x research source compared to alternatives like kayaks learning to paddle a canoe can take some practice however once you get the hang of it you ll have a free environmentally friendly way to visit undisturbed swathes of wilderness alone or with friends not a bad deal,buy or rent proper safety equipment before starting like all aquatic activities safety is very important while canoeing so make sure you have the proper equipment before you set off on your canoeing adventure though rare hazards like drowning are tragically no joke below are bare minimum equipment recommendations contact your local outdoors authority like for instance a park ranger s office for specific information regarding the area you plan on canoeing in also see the things you ll in addition you ll want to be at least a reasonably competent swimmer as capsizing having the canoe flip over can be a frequent problem for beginners maintain a low center of gravity to balance in the canoe your very first time you climb into a canoe you re likely to immediately notice that balancing is difficult and that every small movement seems to shift the boat more than expected to counteract this rocky feeling stay as low as possible you can even sit or kneel in the bottom of the boat until you feel more stable most canoes seats should provide fine balance as long as you aren t moving around or standing up if you are paddling by yourself sit in the back stern with your gear at the front bow so that you ll be able to steer the boat if you don t have much gear you may find it easier to balance by sitting in the center try to sit up as straight as possible in your seat keeping your body perpendicular to the surface of the water usually this means straight up and down gives you the stablest balance 2 x research source don t worry the boat will be more stable when paddle s are in the water as the resistance from the moving water helps to keep the boat upright grip the paddle with one hand on top and the other a few feet down seated securely in the boat grab a paddle with both hands put one hand on top of the end of the handle there should usually be a rounded portion here if there isn t grip the handle near the top this will be referred to as your boat side hand use your other hand to grab a lower point on the handle that s comfortable for you usually this will be at least a foot or so above the flat part of the paddle gripping right next to the flat part isn t advised as it forces you to work harder turn your hand so that your lower palm is facing toward the boat this will be referred to as your water side hand reach forward with your paddle it s time to begin your stroke start by twisting at the torso so that your water side shoulder shifts forward move the paddle forward out of the water then plant it in the water so that the blade of the paddle but not much of the handle is submerged keep the shaft of the paddle as close to vertical as possible for greater strength 3 x research source don t forget your body position as you paddle you want to reach as far ahead as you can without moving from your seat or leaning too far forward this will put you off balance pull the paddle back towards you turn the blade of the paddle so that it is perpendicular to the boat and the direction of travel use your arm and core muscles to pull the paddle through the water in a straight line parallel to the centerline of the boat try to keep the paddle close to the boat as you make your stroke some sources even recommend keeping the inside edge of the paddle touching the canoe having a wider stroke can inadvertently make the boat turn 4 x research source muscle discipline is important for efficient paddling you want to be using mainly the core muscles of your body for power not your back muscles as using the latter can leave you sore and uncomfortable after your boating trip restart the paddling motion at your hip stop applying power to the paddle when the blade reaches your hip begin to bring the blade up and out of the water turn the paddle so the blade is parallel to the surface as you move it forward for the next stroke you are now back at your starting position simply repeat the steps above to continue paddling the canoe should gather momentum and move forward at a good speed however if you paddle only on one side of the boat you ll start going in circles see below for information on cross paddling switch the side you paddle on every few strokes if you ve ever seen someone paddle in a canoe you ve probably noticed that she will pull the paddle out of the water every few strokes and start paddling on the opposite side this is to keep the canoe going in a straight line paddle on only one side and you ll notice yourself start to turn to the side opposite your paddle to cross pull the paddle out of the water when it is at your hip lift it perpendicular to the boat and bring it across while switching the position of the top and bottom hands this should feel natural insert it into the water and paddle as before try practicing this a few times to get a feel for the rhythm of when to switch sides for most switching after every few strokes is best the exact number will vary depending on your paddling form and how hard your strokes are if you re paddling tandem i e with two people in the canoe you ll want to coordinate the switch with your partner see below for information on paddling with a partner paddle on one side continuously for gentle turns the simplest way to turn a canoe is probably the most intuitive assuming you are sitting in the stern rear or center of the canoe simply paddle as you normally would on one side to eventually start turning in the opposite direction that is to turn left paddle on the right side and to turn right paddle on the left side you should notice the course of the boat change slightly with each stroke this method is great for gentle corrections in course because while it doesn t turn the boat quickly it doesn t slow you down either for instance if you see a sandbar jutting out of the water 100 meters ahead it s probably appropriate to use this turning style to get around it you re in no hurry use j strokes for more controlled turns while canoeing you ll eventually find that while paddling on one side of the boat is an effective way of steering in many situations there are plenty of times when quicker turns are required one of the simplest ways to turn is called a j stroke to use this technique you ll ideally want to be sitting in the stern of the boat to do a j stroke put your paddle into the water behind you so that it is nearly flat against the side of the boat which it should be almost touching as you do this twist your torso so that your shoulders point parallel with the sides of the boat use your core and torso muscles to turn back to a forward facing position this should make the paddle turn out to the side a little and the boat should turn to the same side as the paddle is on just like if you were using a rudder avoid over using this stroke while it will make you turn quickly it will also slow down your forward momentum use large back sweeps for sharp turns the j stroke discussed above is actually just a smaller version of a special paddle technique called a back sweep by increasing the size of the back sweep you ll increase the speed at which you turn however larger back sweeps will also make you slow down more so you ll want to reserve them for situations when you need them or you ll have to paddle hard to build up speed again to do a back sweep start out with your paddle behind you as you would for the j stroke this time as you straighten your torso let the paddle swing out completely to the side it should be perpendicular to the side of the boat when you finish the motion you should immediately notice the boat turn to the same side as the paddle is on alternatively use draws for sharp turns another technique for making sharp turns in your canoe is called the draw this technique is effective but since its form is different from any of the other strokes it can be more awkward to execute while moving unless you re an experienced paddler try testing it out at slow speeds before using it in a serious situation to do a draw plant your paddle in the water directly out to your side your arms should be as straight as possible the paddle should be as vertical as you can keep it and your boat side arm should be over your head pull the paddle toward the boat until it touches or is very near to it keeping its blade parallel to the side of the canoe as you do so assuming you are sitting in the stern the canoe should turn to the side opposite the paddle remove the paddle from the water by slicing it backward out of the water without changing the orientation of the blade from here you can transition easily into a standard forward stroke or a j stroke sit at opposite ends of the canoe paddling in tandem with a partner is similar to paddling on your own with some crucial differences when two people are sitting in the same boat it s important to keep the boat trim that is to make sure it sits balanced in the water thus you ll want one person sitting at the bow front of the boat and the other at the stern back this should be the sitting arrangement that feels most natural and balanced if one person is significantly heavier than the other you may want to consider putting more of your gear at this person s end of the canoe to evenly distribute the weight in traditional canoe terms the person sitting at the bow is called the bowman and the person at the stern is called the sternman let the bowman set the pace when paddling as a team you want to synchronize your strokes start and finish them at the same time to get maximum power since the bowman is facing forward and can t see the sternman the bowman sets the pace this means it is up to the stern man to match his strokes to the bowman s not the other way around of course both paddlers can and should talk to each other to figure out a comfortable pace good communication is key for a quick happy voyage let the sternman handle steering the person sitting in the stern of the boat will almost always have an easier time determining the direction of the boat than the person in front thus the sternman is responsible for making sure the boat is going in the right direction she should use her normal strokes as well as special techniques like j strokes and sweeps to keep the boat pointed forward the bowman may assist in turns but will not usually be able to take a leading role the reason that the sternman has greater control over the boat s steering has to do with the force of resistance the water puts on the boat essentially since the bow of the boat is responsible for cutting through the water it is constantly feeling the resistance of the water that it pushes out of the way the stern on the other hand doesn t have this problem so it usually feels less of a push from the water around it making it easier to turn synchronize your side switching to travel in a straight line when traveling forward having both people paddle on opposite sides of the canoe generally gives the straightest result to make sure you don t accidentally start paddling on the same side of the boat and cause it to turn make sure to switch sides at the same time generally the sternman calls out switch when it is time to do so note that since the sternman has greater control over the direction of the boat the canoe will usually gradually turn away from the side the sternman is paddling on even if the bowman is paddling on the opposite side this is why switching sides is important be aware of differences in steering techniques for the bowman with the addition of a second paddler steering a canoe becomes slightly different while all of the stern man s steering techniques described in the section above will work as normal the bowman s efforts to steer can work differently because of his position at the front of the boat if the bowman understands these differences he can assist with the steering of the boat below is a summary of techniques the bowman can use to help steer paddling forward works normally the boat will turn away from the bowman s paddle draws work backwards the boat will turn towards the bowman s paddle instead of doing back sweeps bowman usually use a technique called the front sweep to help steer this is essentially the opposite of a back sweep the bowman reaches forward with the paddle then pulls it back and out to the side in a wide arc along the surface of the water this works like a stronger version of the ordinary forward stroke turning the boat away from the bowman s paddle,Sports-and-Fitness
how to paddle a canoe alone using the j stroke,people often think of canoeing as a two person activity believing a canoe to be unmanageable by one person while a full size canoe is a bit harder to handle alone than a kayak canoeing alone is by no means impossible with the help of a handy technique called the j stroke you can ensure that your canoeing fun is not dependent on finding a partner to get out on the water with you just follow these steps to propel your canoe in a straight line without the hassle of switching your paddle to the other side every few strokes,unload your canoe into the water guides on this can be found elsewhere seat yourself in the canoe when paddling a two person canoe alone you should sit in the bow seat the one closer to the middle of the canoe facing backwards toward the stern this position prevents the other end of the canoe from rising too far out of the water due to your weight steering a canoe with one end out of the water is extremely difficult especially in windy conditions some people recommend kneeling in the exact middle of the canoe but this actually makes steering much more difficult since most steering strokes will simply push the canoe sideways rather than turn it when sitting in this position grip your paddle one hand should be gripping the top of the paddle with the other hand gripping directly above the blade use whichever hand feels comfortable to you preference for paddling on one side or the other actually seems to be independent of which hand is dominant reach forward with the paddle on the side of the canoe corresponding to your lower hand until your bottom arm is fully extended 1 x research source dip the paddle into the water until the blade is totally submerged 2 x research source pull the paddle back until your lower hand is slightly behind your torso 3 x research source rotate the paddle ninety degrees so that the face of the blade is parallel with the side of the canoe 4 x research source push the blade out away from the canoe by using the edge of the canoe as a fulcrum and pulling the top of the paddle in the opposite direction 5 x research source pull the blade of the paddle out of the water and return to step 4,Sports-and-Fitness

be uneven and have high riverbanks pick up a river guide in your area and read about the river easy sloped banks sand bars and flat level camp sites will make your trip more enjoyable select your tent the upside of camping with a canoe vs backpacking is that it affords you the ability to take a great deal more camping equipment the downside is you may be tempted to take too much you should pay particular attention to your tent a comfortable tent is very nice on the river however if you go too large you may have difficulty finding a place to put it a tent between 7 and 11 2 1 3 4 meters

some rivers contain potable water so you might be okay to take from the river but it is always a good idea to bring drinking water and a filter pump try to cool anything that needs cooling before putting it in your cooler meats that you won t be eating on the first or second day can be frozen a great tip for some of your water is to freeze 20oz water bottles and put them in your cooler they keep your other stuff cool and when they melt you have drinking water four days is about as long as a run of the mill cooler can keep things chilled try to find block ice 1 or 2 blocks will last longer than ice cubes don t drain the water unless you re resupplying your ice or the trip is over you ll only be replacing cold water with warm air and your ice will melt faster prep the kitchen you ll want some kind of gas stove whether propane or white gas for cooking vegetables heating water for coffee or tea or just to have warm water to wash dishes a roll up table or two and a stove stand make cooking much easier and much more enjoyable paper plates and bowls help keep the clean up low as they can be tossed on the fire after you ve finished your meal bring as many paper goods as possible and only bring a cup a coffee mug and silverware that require cleaning for pots and pans you can bring anything you have bring some pots designed for camping or if you have some pots and pans you ve retired from the kitchen avoid cast iron on the river as it will most likely get wet and start to rust which may ruin it for coffee try a manual drip coffee maker there are many styles to choose from some very inexpensive which will give you a cup of coffee as good as you get from home without electricity or having to resort to backpacking techniques bring clothes and personal items while summer camping is usually warm you should bring extra clothes just in case most years you ll only need a bathing suit and t shirt but a pair of sweat pants and sweat shirt can really be nice if the weather turns cool choose your bedding on the trail it may be prudent to bring a therm o rest on which to lay your weary bones but you have a canoe so bring that queen sized air mattress and the electric pump to fill it use dry bags a good dry bag is best for keeping your stuff dry in rough conditions they re specially designed to keep things dry even if submerged don t trust ordinary trash bags they ll only keep it dry if it s a light rain and they are easily punctured if the rain is severe or you dump your canoe everything will get soaked you ll be glad you made that 20 or so investment when you re soaked and your bedding and extra clothes are still dry pack common items in a trunk a dry trunk is just a plastic trunk or container of some kind into which everyone puts their common camping items common camping items are things like pots pans coffee pot mug cup camp saw stove stand paper towels paper plates bowls cutting board knife bug spray matches lighter emergency space blanket extra batteries lantern mantles sponge camp soap silverware bottles of stove fuel hiking stove etc these are some things that you can leave in the trunk from one year to the next and know that all you have to do is pack that plus your tent bedding and personal items and you re ready to go you can even bring more than this but it is the minimum for a decent camping trip select one that fits your canoe well and has some method of latching the top closed if you dump you don t want it spilling all your gear over the bottom of the river empty 5 gallon paint buckets about 6 with lid at home repair centers are a great dry place to store small items like backpacking stoves extra fuel small lanterns flashlites charcoal radios etc bring something that you can store all your trash in and make sure its sealable you don t want to litter and you don t want any sticky things spilling on you bring a toilet and shovel this is where canoe camping becomes more like backpacking sooner or later you re going to have to take care of business and leaning against a tree or squatting simply isn t that much fun a portable toilet system allows you to dig a hole in the soil set up over it and do what needs doing when it s time to leave you simply pack the potty up and fill in the hole you dug you might want to get a kit that has a nice shelter to give you privacy but it is pricey there are less expensive options you can choose that will work just as well but go for a product with good durability for a shovel any good folding shovel will do the job test pack your canoe the night before there are two objectives here one is to pack efficiently so that the gear isn t sitting too high above the gunwales the other is to balance out the canoe so it doesn t list to one side once you have it packed you ll want to develop some system of tying everything into the canoe a small tarp with criss crossing ropes works well or just threading the rope through handles or other openings is a good idea anything that will keep the gear with the boat if you dump it bring extra paddles tie extra paddles to your boat in case you go over and lose the ones you re using use a motor purists may not like this one but an electric motor can be a lifesaver and a timesaver this is an expensive option though so if you re trying to go on the cheap you may want to avoid this as you ll need the motor a battery for the motor and registration for the canoe bring a chair and table a sling chair and accompanying table makes life on site so much more comfortable bring an umbrella for about 14 you can purchase a beach umbrella with a 6 1 8m spread these are great if you need to get out of the sun or keep rain off of you you can keep it in the boat so if it rains while you re traveling downstream you can throw it up quickly and stay dry you can also use it at your campsite for the same purpose it can also be used as a sail when there is a light breeze in the right direction wear water shoes no matter how soft sand feels it s like sandpaper on your feet flip flops and sandals aren t as good as flip flops fall off when walking in the water and sandals tend to get small stones between your foot and the sole if the river is known to be rocky like those in central us missouri arkansas tennessee you ll want water shoes with hard stiff soles rather than flexible soles like those found on aqua sock type shoes what ever you use you ll want it cover your toes and be secured on your heel otherwise when wading or lining your canoe in shallow areas a foot injury or lost shoe is likely use your imagination this is what makes canoe camping so much fun you can do it very simply and bring very little or you can bring a screen house a self standing hammock an 11x11 tent and everything else

how to plan a canoe trip,hopping in a canoe and spending a few days paddling a river is a great way to get out of the city for a while relax and appreciate the beauty of natural wetlands preparations for this kind of excursion are similar to those for backpacking but the added presence of the living river changes the game in a few very important ways,find a river consider your skill level and do your homework do you feel up to tackling rough waters are there dams on the river you will need to port pick your canoe up out of the water and walk it to the other side of the dam get a canoe assuming you don t already own one lots of rivers that are navigable will have multiple canoe liveries that can not only rent you a canoe and the proper equipment but also shuttle you to a convenient drop off point and pick you up where you want to end your trip plan your trip a good livery will be able to give you a rough idea of how long it will take to travel down different portions of the river what obstacles you might face during the trip dams rough water etc and who you will need to talk to for the proper permits get a map even if the river is a straight shot from one end to the other you will probably want to know where you are at some point there are a few detailed maps published that you can purchase through amazon com for more common waterways but the easiest and cheapest way to get a river map is to find it with a mapping tool like google earth just locate the river and print out the portion you plan on canoeing it is a good idea to get a few good close up images of important sections campsites forks in the waterway entry and exit points etc to help you identify landmarks a gps unit can be helpful to keep you on course too food is a must have plan your snacks and meals out and bring only as much food as will be consumed remember that you will probably have to pack out any opened cans or plastic garbage and keep them to a minimum it s best not to bring perishables like eggs meat etc on multi day trips but if you must then use a small cooler with a block of ice in the bottom and cubed ice up to the top tied closed and to the canoe with bungee cords plan to use the most perishable items first water is important to stock up you will probably or at least should drink a great deal of water much more than you normally do since you are exercising and exposed to the elements throughout most of the trip bring a sports style water bottle for each person and a gallon of clean drinking water in a jug to get started this probably won t be enough however to get potable water from a river you can a filter it with a pump style water filter b clean it chemically with iodine tablets and neutralizer or c boil it weather and time of year there is usually a distinct lack of shelter while paddling down a river check the local weather the day before you leave to get an idea of how to pack but always expect at least one cold night one hot day and rain always bring a raincoat and some lightweight tarps in case of rain sunblock and sunglasses for lots of sun and a light jacket and pants for cool evenings fire equipment pack all of your fire making tools in a water tight container like a plastic jar or dry bag pick up a fire starting product that says it will light even when wet since you might have trouble finding dry tinder lying around plastic bags all clothing bedding and food should be kept in plastic garbage bags the clear ones are best these won t help if you dump the canoe but they will keep important things dry if it starts to rain or your canoe gets splashed pack an assortment of extra zip locks and garbage bags to replace ones that have ripped open,Sports-and-Fitness

exhale should be slow and measured and part of your regular pattern 3 x research source 4 x research source aim well in order to throw a truly powerful punch that has the effect you want it to have you need to aim well however as there are a number of types of punches you can throw you ll have to aim accordingly based on the punch when punching make sure to close your fist all the way at the last possible second this helps to cause maximum damage always punch through the target as if there was something behind them you were aiming for punches should always be done with proper wrist

target make sure to rotate your body torso as you throw your punch your punch should come from your shoulders which should stay relaxed and should be raised slightly your hands should tighten up into a solid fist immediately before throwing your punch 6 x research source move your body not just your arms and fists in order to punch with power you ll have to be able to move your body with your arms this is because if you move your body and your arms you ll be able to fully put the force and weight of your body into your punch if your arms are advancing a foot in distance to make a punch make sure your body does as well avoid just moving your arms forward if you do this you ll lack a lot of force that would otherwise make your punch more powerful be careful of getting too close when advancing with your body timing is extremely important so watch for the perfect opportunity to advance with your arms and your body 7 x research source take advantage of your legs make sure to take

arms if you overextend yourself you won t be able to take advantage of the weight of your body this will result in a weaker punch proper extension of your arms depends on your body type and arm length a good rule of thumb is to avoid extending your arms straight out instead they should always have some sort of bend in them 9 x research source practice punching drills as you would expect one of the best ways to build a power punch is to practice punching as much as you can in your punching drills you ll practice throwing your punches slow and deliberately practicing your punches will help you

first set can be 12 your second 10 and your third 8 adjust sets reps and weight as you progress a timed training routine boxing rounds last for about 3 minutes 5 minutes for the ufc so workout for 3 5 minutes then take a 1 minute break try 3 repetitions while light weight training works well you may also want to consider heavier weights to build more power a few good weight training sets for building punching power include hack squats dumbbell snatches deadlifts box jumps quarter squats and squat jumps consider 3 sets to starts 12 x research source 13 x research source train with a medicine ball while lifting weights helps with the mass for the punching power it s nearly useless if you want to achieve proper hand speed and coordination instead train with a medicine ball training with a medicine ball will work out many of the muscles you ll need to improve your speed agility and coordination consider the following workout hold your medicine ball at shoulder height standing in front of a wall then lower your knees in a squatting position and explosively throw the ball into the air catch the ball with your hands and throw it explosively at the wall quickly pick up the ball

execute your techniques appropriately and take advantage of everything you ve built on and learned in training do not let emotions ever rule you always stay cool and level headed if you abandon your training and follow your emotions you ll slip up and wind up throwing weak and inaccurate punches always keep your eye on your goal whether your goal of throwing power punches is to win a single match

breathing your punches will get sloppy and weak 16 x research source avoid telegraphing telegraphing is when you pull your hands back slightly before you throw your punch this is a tell that lets your opponent know that you are getting ready to throw a punch telegraphing can enable your opponent to dodge your punch telegraphing may enable your opponent to counter punch in a more effective manner to avoid telegraphing video tape yourself when you practice this way you ll be able to review the recording and see if you telegraph or give any other tells of your actions or strategy 17 x research source know that speed is not power some people falsely equate punching speed with punching power this is not the case in order to punch with power you ll have to be able to distinguish between speed and power fast punches will not pack power unless they have power and force behind them punching fast in succession may undermine your ability to be able to deal out powerful punches punching fast may make you vulnerable to a counter punch that will hurt you and prevent you from dealing the power punches you want to throw 18 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness

your fingers straight until you have brought the wrap between them close your hand into a fist then wind the wrap down around your wrist bring the wrap around your palm to your thumb pass the wrap between your thumb and index finger again wrap diagonally downwards towards the edge of your wrist then complete a full loop around it the wrap roll will be back at your thumb when you re done 7 x research source flex your fingers to test the wrap make sure it feels secure but not restrictive secure your remaining fingers by passing the wrap between them you will need to repeat the previous motions a total of 3 times start by bringing the fabric between your middle and ring fingers wrap diagonally towards to your wrist then go all the way around your wrist so the wrap ends up near your thumb then do this for the remaining sets of fingers 8 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 remember to close your hand into a fist every time you pass the wrap between 2 fingers make sure the wrap is at the proper consistency before continuing bring the wrap around your wrist and secure it in place if you haven t already take the wrap around your thumb and down to the edge of your wrist below it you won t have much wrap left only enough to pass around your wrist 2 or 3 more times press the adhesive end against your wrist to hold the wrap in place then give it a good test before getting into the ring 9 x research source the wrap should stop about 3 4 of the way up your forearm 10 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 to test the wrap close your hand into a fist check that your knuckles are level with your fingers make sure your wrist looks straight in the wrap so it doesn t bend while punching this is the traditional wrapping style used by many experienced muay thai fighters some fighters prefer a boxing style wrap which may be a little bulkier but still effective select an elastic wrap that fits comfortably on your hands basic hand wraps are made with cotton and held in place with a patch of velcro the most useful type of wrap you can get are elastic wraps also called mexican hand wraps the elastic fibers make these wraps easier to put on and more comfortable to wear 11 x research source non elastic wraps are also an option these wraps tend to be more durable than elastic wraps so they re particularly good for training sessions the most important part is comfort pick a wrap you are most comfortable using and get spares so you always have a clean pair available choose a wrap that is long enough to fit over your hand a standard wrap is about 180 in 460 cm long this is an ideal size for most adults however wraps are available in all sorts of sizes including junior sizes you can only learn what size is right for you by trying on wraps of different lengths 12 x research source choosing a wrap length is a personal process the length you need depends on how you wrap your hands and what feels best to you if you can t finish wrapping your hands by bringing the fabric around your wrist a few times you need a longer wrap similarly if you have a lot of material left when you re done wrapping try a shorter wrap hold your wrist straight while wrapping your hand bending your wrist makes it more prone to injury your wrist needs to be level with your hand and forearm at all times if you bend your wrist at all the wrap will hold it in a bent position undo the wrapping and start over to avoid any problems 13 x research source make sure your wrist feels comfortable in the wrapping if it feels bent hitting something can cause it to bend further never begin sparring unless you are sure your hands are well wrapped pad your fingers around the first knuckle when your hands are well wrapped your fingers are cushioned but still free to move independently this is done in muay thai by taking the wrap between your fingers and around your wrist avoid wrapping your hands beyond the first knuckle since the wrap will restrict your fingers 14 x research source for protection make sure the wrap is thick around each knuckle as well as your wrist when you wrap your hands correctly the wrap will feel snug enough to stay in place but it won t feel tight enough to hinder your circulation,Sports-and-Fitness
how to become a better kickboxer,whether you are a beginner who is ready to leave behind the shadow boxing and start sparring with other fighters or a more experienced fighter looking to perfect your style there is always room for improvement in kickboxing since a lot of the initial training focuses on building your offense balancing these skills with a strong defense and footwork is key but regardless of what areas need the most work the most important thing is to approach your sparring sessions with a studied approach and clear aims,start slowly once you are ready to graduate from training on your own to practicing with real live partners resist the urge to treat sparring sessions as actual matches instead utilize these sessions as what they are practice begin sparring at a pace and volume that suits your abilities at the current moment rather than launching into an all out bout right from the get go 1 x research source don t rush into sparring work with your coach to develop good fundamentals like control balance and leg strength 2 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 as an upcoming match draws near increase the intensity to match level during the week leading up to it to prepare yourself for an actual fight allow a day or two of rest immediately before the match to recuperate and avoid injury slow things down again once the match has passed so you can continue to work on new techniques or improve on those that need more work find the right partner team up with people who are willing to stick to a given pace and volume avoid those who may escalate the intensity of your sparring out of boredom disrespect or competitiveness before you begin each session have a conversation with your partner about how hard you wish to spar and then agree to stick to that level of intensity 3 x research source things to consider when discussing the parameters of your sparring include the length of each round where and where not to hit and the acceptable force of impact ideally find a partner who is either on the same level as you or better a partner with equal abilities will allow the two of you to grow together while a more experienced partner will most likely have better control over their level of intensity remain vigilant once the two of you start sparring be on the lookout for the first steps of escalation even when you have a well meaning partner one quicker or more powerful strike than agreed upon can easily lead to an even quicker or more powerful strike from the other and from there the intensity will only continue to mount 4 x research source if you find the pace and volume growing beyond what was discussed beforehand or slackening off speak up rein the both of you back to the agreed upon level of hardship 5 x research source expect a sparring partner with more experience than you to possibly overestimate your abilities and or regress into their own performance level without realizing it expect a partner with less experience to have a more difficult time resisting the urge to give it their all try to avoid trading blows it might be effective for a short time to absorb a strike in order to give one back but as the fight goes on it will start to wear on your body 6 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 spar with specific goals in mind there are far too many different types of strikes and combos to use effectively all at once right from the start ease up on your expectations of yourself take baby steps before you spar determine which techniques you need to work on the most choose one or two to focus on in any given session learn how to do each one well before broadening your scope and incorporating other techniques 7 x research source punches cross hook jab uppercut 8 x research source kicks front hook round side spinning back combos 1 front kick cross hook 2 left jab left side kick right cross round kick 3 double left jab cross hook round kick seek feedback treat your sparring partner as a teammate not an opponent use them as a source for pointers on how to improve your techniques after each session especially if they managed to dominate you throughout or delivered any surprises that took you off your feet ask them what openings they saw that allowed them to score points on you utilize their eyes to spot any weaknesses or habits that you may have shown so you can work at hiding them from future opponents 9 x research source remember teamsmanship is a two way street so reciprocate be honest with your feedback when your partner asks about their own performance and volunteer advice when you catch them making mistakes that they may not be aware of in order to ensure that they will do the same for you find more partners spar with a variety of people who range in size body type speed etc go up against tall fighters short fighters scrawny ones bulky ones those who are lightning fast and those who rely less on speed and more on brute force seek out right handed and left handed fighters to learn how to adapt your own stance and techniques to both situations develop strategies to counter each opponent s strengths and take advantage of their weaknesses 10 x research source for example say you are very quick on your feet while your partner is much larger but slower use your speed to get in and out of striking range as quickly possible with just enough time for you strike but not enough for them to do the same now let s say the opposite your opponent is much quicker to you back them into corners so they have no room to retreat wear weights wear three to five pound wrist and ankle weights during sparring sessions as well as during other training grow accustomed to having to work harder to accomplish strikes blocks and footwork effectively develop the necessary speed and power with this extra weight in order to increase your endurance during live matches when your hands and feet will be that much lighter without the weights 11 x research source this will also make it easier for you to keep your hands up to block strikes despite growing tired over the course of particularly long or brutal matches be aware that consistent use of ankle and leg weights have been linked to injuries due to the extra strain they place on your joints such injuries are not universal among all users but play it safe anyway avoid using them all the time and discontinue immediately if you begin to feel pain in nearby joints tendons and ligaments 12 x research source you can also use a weighted vest to strengthen your legs when you re doing exercises like sprints and lunges 13 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 use focus pads take time out from sparring to practice your offense ask a partner to hold up pads for you to punch and kick use this opportunity to perfect your strikes without having to worry about being struck in return focus on delivering your strikes with optimum force and minimal effort so that doing so comes more naturally to you in the midst of a match keep your head mobile hold your hands up to block strikes as instructed but do not rely on this alone to keep your head protected in a match in addition to raising your hands and arms for cover make your head a moving target so that your opponent s strikes are less likely to connect stand in front of a mirror imagine that you have a marker fixed to the top of your head now practice moving your head as though you were writing a specific letter of the alphabet on the ceiling over and over again 14 x research source stick to letters that are simple in design like t v c s and l be sure to practice their mirror image as well don t bother with more intricately designed letters like a b and r or any other letter that continues to feel awkward in practice since these head movements have little practicality in a match once each movement feels natural after practicing them alone in front of a mirror incorporate them one by one into sparring sessions to learn which works best as an evasive maneuver against certain strikes try using a slip ball to help you work on your reactions and head movement 15 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 volunteer to hold pads when you pair off with a partner to practice strikes don t cheat yourself by placing too much emphasis on your turn as striker use the role as strike to improve your defense since you don t have to worry about getting hit anywhere other than your pads seize this opportunity to strengthen skills beyond the offense 16 x research source take the time to analyze your partner s stances and techniques develop your skill at identifying their weaknesses and habits in the moment so that you will be quicker to recognize the same weaknesses in other opponents during live matches since you have fewer things to do with your hands use this opportunity to concentrate your footwork learn how to dictate the fight with your feet alone focus on how you can alternate your speed footing and direction to disrupt your partner s tempo and back them up in directions they don t want to go grow accustomed to being struck getting hit can literally be a blow both physically and mentally face the reality that this will happen don t define the perfect fighter as someone who never gets hit 17 x research source instead aim to be the perfect fighter who bounces back from blows instantly embrace every strike that sneaks by your defenses in training as an opportunity to grow that much more acquainted with the sensation of being struck when it is your turn to hold pads when practicing strikes with a partner focus on your blocks and shields to further normalize the feel of receiving blows so that they are less of a distraction in live matches 18 x research source use medicine balls to acquaint your core with being struck ask a partner to stand beside you while you lay on the floor and do crunches sit ups ab pikes or similar exercises in which your back is on the ground in between each rep before you begin agree to the amount of force your partner will use then in between each rep when your back is flat on the ground let them drop or even hurl the medicine ball straight at your abs keep your eyes open the closer your opponent is to you the more likely either one of you can deliver a strike in the blink of an eye so don t blink avoid missing an incoming strike or an opening on their part that you can take advantage of keep your eyes peeled as long as possible when you are in close and blink rapidly to make up for it when you are spread well apart from each other keeping your eyes open for as long as you can is a technique that you can easily practice both in and out of the ring jog 19 x research source build physical endurance that will carry over to matches within the ring at the same time grow accustomed to having to move your feet a lot during matches to avoid overexerting yourself and risking injury start off with daily jogs at both a pace and a duration that you can manage easily so that you are able to converse with a partner without becoming too winded 20 x research source if needed alternate between jogging and walking in the beginning if your endurance is low at first set off at a jogging pace for one minute then fall back to walking for four minutes repeat three times for a total of 20 minutes as this grows more comfortable increase the time spent jogging and reduce that spent walking period by one minute each from run to run until you are able to comfortably jog for 20 minutes without stopping from there add additional increments of five or ten minutes to your runs as they become more manageable 21 x research source run sprints 22 x research source once you are able to jog for a fair amount of distance work on increasing your speed improve your ability to burst into motion at maximum speed so you can move around the ring quickly hit the track and run reps on the 100 meter straightaway again start small in order to avoid overexerting and hurting yourself 23 x research source keep to only a handful of reps at first start off with a less than full sprint that you can maintain from start to finish of each rep so that your last rep matches the same speed as your first as each workout becomes easier increase your speed to a full sprint then add a rep or two to each workout be sure to go for a short jog first to warm your legs up and reduce the chance of injury alternating long distance running and sprints will help you improve your stamina and recovery while also preparing you for the chaos of a boxing match 24 x expert source david engel muay thai instructor self defense trainer expert interview 5 may 2020 charge hills 25 x research source after warming up with a brief jog run intervals up the slope of a low steep incline or if all of the hills in your area are all incredibly high mark a finish line along the slope that you can reach in about eight to twelve seconds sprint up the hill with short strides walk or jog back down and then repeat develop the ability to spring off your toes with this workout which maximizes the most amount of muscles in your legs 26 x research source as with all interval training take baby steps at first to familiarize yourself with the physical demands of this workout ease off the pace in the beginning aim to run a consistent speed in each rep throughout the workout once you can manage to run that pace from start to finish increase your speed with the next workout jump rope improve your balance while you exercise your feet and legs with a variety of jump rope workouts jump with both feet for three minutes at a slow pace until this becomes nearly effortless then alternate between fast and slow with 30 second intervals of each speed for a total of three minutes 27 x research source in other rounds stick to jumping on just one foot for a total of ten steps then switch to the other until your three minutes are up avoid sticking to just one pace or style from workout to workout so you can better adapt to quick changes in your opponent s speed in the ring do box steps find a step sturdy box or other elevated surface that will support your weight use one that is about a foot high or roughly shin level when you stand next to it do step workouts at sprint speed do one steps returning each foot to ground level before stepping up with the other foot double steps bringing one foot up then the other before returning each to ground level or a combination of the two to increase speed and force 28 x research source consistency is key so start off with moderate intervals of 30 seconds each until you are able to perform each at an even speed with no missteps then gradually increase your reps by 10 or 15 seconds in future workouts practice backing up set up a minimum of four traffic cones or other suitable obstacles in a straight line place them evenly with enough room between each for you to weave between them stand at the head of the line with your back to the cones then keeping your heels off the ground jog backwards and weave around each cone at the end of the line about face by pivoting on the ball of one foot and then repeat increase your confidence in retreating from your opponents without tripping over your own feet or having to look behind you 29 x research source whatever objects you choose in lieu of traffic cones make sure they are relatively soft or otherwise unlikely to cause injury should you make a few missteps in the beginning,Sports-and-Fitness
how to counterattack,counterattacking in a fight can save you a lot of pain and energy this guide will explain several counterattacking moves as always you should only be fighting in the first place in self defense,first counterattacking doesn t necessarily work for those who are the strongest and fastest if you do everything correctly it should work out fine now the first step is to be calm if you aren t calm and you re panicky countering is much less likely to succeed wait for the attacker to make a move if he attempts a tackle just dodge it by moving to either side as fast as possible if he goes for a move with his arms or hands such as a punch intercept the blow as soon as you can next as quickly as you can twist his arm and attempt to bring it behind him when you re done you should have a hand firmly on his arm with it pressed against his back this places you behind him and is rather painful if he is quick or strong throw your arm around his neck and put him in a headlock of sorts further stabilizing yourself the next move is up to you if he tries to kick you block the attack first this will probably stagger him and make the counter easier grab his leg and rip as hard as you can in any direction but going towards you can work well if he falls try to bring his leg up and close to his back as fast as possible sit on him if you have to but keep his leg held if he reverses the counterattack get out of there and recover if he starts a leg choke you re done for unless you re lucky or very fast and strong if he attempts a grapple you can dodge or you can let him get you the second option can be better in some cases keep in mind that untrained grapples are much much easier to counter than someone who s trained in brazilian jiu jitsu for half of his life still even if you re fighting a complete noob you have to be careful first break his grip this can be done many ways but simple grabbing his arm and tearing it away can work if it doesn t strike the inside of his arm and aim for the elbow joint if you hit him hard enough not only will it hurt like hell for him but he ll probably let go in the split second of confusion is when you make your counter snatch his arm and do something similar to a punch counterattack or you can try a new move place an open palm with your fingers together on the outside elbow joint then grab his wrist the backs of your hands should be facing you then with one foot planted solidly put your other leg in front of him like you re going to trip him because you will now throw him from the arm you have seized and he should fall quite naturally from here you have him on his stomach with his arm pulled out and back he is pretty helpless you can hold him there even better by putting the foot you tripped him with on his back from here you can inflict pain by pressing on his joint be careful though you can easily break his arm unintentionally or intentionally for punches strike his forearm as he is about to hit you defend the other side of your head with your arm and then follow through with a punch of your own with the arm you just deflected with give him a hook to the cheek your arm should already be in a position where it will seem more like a haymaker then you can back away and wait for him to attack again or you can go in and continue pummeling him take whatever he gives you if he kicks grab his leg and knock him off balance if he punches or grabs you hold his hand to your body he will become distracted with losing his hand and will be open to punching or kicking if you catch his leg pull him towards you and you should be on top from there you can punch his stomach or face if you fail to catch his leg several times go to plan b wait until the kick hits and then charge him tackling him he should fall down rather easily from there you can beat on him from above if he attempts a grapple there is one simple move you can do put your hands on his shoulders push down and knee him on the nose while he s going down this move is crippling and if you do several in a row he will probably be done if you can t knee him in the nose then just fall on top of his body and pin him down this will stop his body from moving unless he is strong enough to pull back from your fall,Sports-and-Fitness
how to learn the basics of jar kai,jar kai is more of a technique or a tactic than a true lightsaber form it revolves around the idea of using more than one lightsaber in combat,choose your blades most jedi prefer to wield a shoto a short 60cm blade lightsaber in their off hand as it is easier to maneuvre you can wield two shotos or two full length lightsabers if you prefer some jedi used a guard shoto a shoto with a handle coming out of the side like a police baton choose your grip you can wield both blades with either a standard or a reverse grip or do one of each as the shoto is easier to maneuvre if you have one i would recommend using it for the reversed grip practise the basic forms ataru and niman are particularly suited for dual blades but they can also be applied to the other forms start slowly so that you don t stab yourself with your own lightsabers then build up speed when you re more confident don t become reliant on your second blade if you lose your second blade you ll be in big trouble practise with only one blade at least as much as you practise with both understand the limitations of dual blades if you use dual blades you cannot use a two handed grip this means that your blocks and attacks will be weaker than usual if you re inside dual blades are harder to maneuver within the confines of the walls don t hit your lightsabers together one of the worst things you can do in jar kai is accidentally block your own attack with your second blade practise practise practise saberstaffs are harder to master than dual blades most of the moves of the main forms you will have to adapt or you ll end up slicing yourself in half with your second blade take up quarterstaff training to help don t focus on both blades this is a mistake that many people make with a saberstaff the blades form a straight line therefore if you know the location of one of the blades you should be able to infer the position of the other understand that a saberstaff is no better than a regular lightsaber in fact a regular lightsaber may be better if you re attacking somebody in front of you with a saberstaff the second blade is pointing behind you so you can t attack with two blades at once saberstaffs are far more unwieldy indoors than a regular lightsaber most of their value comes from the fact that as they are very rare it can be quite shocking to suddenly find yourself facing one practise spinning your saberstaff with both hands because a saberstaff is longer and heavier than a regular lightsaber it has a higher moment of inertia basically you have to apply more force to make it spin at the same speed use both hands at the centre of the handle although you can t attack with both blades at once you can defend with both saberstaffs are much better than regular sabers for defence as there is more blade to defend with try practising soresu or niman as one of your main forms understand what is meant by paired blades paired blades are like the ones asajj ventress wields dual blades that can be attatched and detached to form a saberstaff practise with just one lightsaber use the main forms this is important because if you detach your lightsabers and then lose one you only have one blade left practise with your sabers in both dual blade and saberstaff modes learn which is best for each situation learn when to change modes if you change modes partway through a battle it can surprise your opponent this can work out to your advantage,Sports-and-Fitness
how to understand the basics of standup fighting,many styles of fighting have the same very basic moves there are only so many ways you can kick for example here we will cover the basic moves common to many different fighting styles,learn your stance keep your hands up in front of your face at least above your chin and keep your elbows in have your left foot forward and your right foot back if you are right handed the opposite if you are left handed understand that with a left foot forward stance your left hand will be your jab and your right will be your power and the opposite if you have a right foot forward stance bend your knees at all times more power and reach come from your legs and butt clench your fists with your thumb curled under your fingers not loose on the outside or you may break it master basic punching extend your arm and make sure the back of your hand is facing the sky your elbow should be pointing out to the side and slightly down for your power punch right hand if your right handed and left hand if your left handed do the same basic thing as your jab but since this is the hand that should be in the back because of the way your stance is one foot forward you must use your shoulder power and move your shoulder forward so you are getting more power into it put even more power into your punch by turning your foot and rotating your body towards your target this will give you three powerful points to your punch the shoulder turn the body turn and the elbow extension remember to lead with your jab and return it quickly back to your stance use it more frequently to set up the big knockout shot that you use with your back hand understand the basic round kick most kicks come from your back leg in all round kicks you will be hitting your opponent with your shin not your foot stand in your stance and lift your back leg up so your knee is bent rotate your hips in the direction you want to kick extend your leg and chop down at the area you want to kick make sure you rotate your foot when you kick just like when punching to get full power into your kicks learn the three main side kicking areas that will inflict the most damage the leg the midsection and the head hit the thigh of your opponents leg right above the knee if you hit your shin against theirs it will be painful to the both of you so condition yourself to give pain aim for right below the opponents ribs where the kidneys are for the midsection kicks learn the best strike zones for a head kick the jaw and on the temple head kicks are only good if you are flexible enough to reach your target without falling stretch and practice learn the clinch hold the clinch hold is important if you want to take the fight to the ground or prevent going to ground clinching is when both opponents are locked up standing but holding on to each other the martial art that focuses on strikes from the clinch is muay thai thai boxing locked in a neutral clinch position each person will have an underhook an underhook is when you have your arm hooked under your opponents bicep or armpit having two under hooks is an advantageous position other types of clinching include when you have your arms lock around your opponent s waist you can transition to this position from double underhooks by lowering yourself and locking your hands clinching 2 from the arms locked around waist position your opponent can knee you but even if they do you have a huge leverage advantage over them and can actually lift them up if you have any strength at all and your opponent is within 25lbs and drop them matt hughes the previous welterweight ufc title holder was famous for ko ing people just with this slam also from that position you can knee your opponent in the calf remember to keep your front foot steady so you don t fall when kneeing any opponent shoot your hips forward while kneeing kneeing is just as much in the hips as it is in the knees as you should as you follow through with the knee clinching3 perhaps the most dangerous strike that has been used in nhb fighting is the elbow it has been used to knock out opponents from the ground and practically anywhere else all punching power comes from your legs butt and hips bend your legs this is called sitting in your punches you should point your toes in the direction your punch is being thrown and put your hips into it this is how you get your body behind your punches get your opponent up against a wall fence or ring and transition your lead forearm up against their chest or if possible the neck this should hold them in position for at least a couple of seconds the exact position you will be your lead forearm against their neck and your back arm up against their shoulder your lead shoulder should be up against their shoulder trapping their arm quickly free your other arm from holding him against the wall and elbow your opponent in the face it should be a quick fluid motion that follows through than quickly returns after it makes contact the arm used for elbowing should be immediately returned to holding your opponents shoulder against the wall so he doesn t escape,Sports-and-Fitness

how to train for fighting with isometrics,your muscles can contract in a variety of ways including isometric contractions eccentric contractions and concentric contractions isometric contractions are where nearly all of your muscle fibers are activated by tensing the entire muscle without changing its length like when you re pushing against a wall 1 x research source isometric exercises reduce your exercise time frame and require little or no equipment 2 x research source when you re training for fighting martial arts or boxing isometric activities can be effective exercises to include in your training,use proper form for isometric exercises proper form is important for all exercises cardio and strength training combined however isometric exercises are somewhat unique and should be performed carefully for any isometric exercise you need to hold the required position as these are static exercises in addition you need to tense all muscles involved both the agonist muscles those that help you hold the position and the antagonist muscles the ones that oppose the position 3 x research source for example in a squat you d squat half way down and hold that position in addition you need to tense the front of your thighs in addition to the back of your thighs abs and glutes also advance slowly when trying to increase the reps or length of your contraction start with 3 reps of a 6 second contraction once this becomes easy add one rep per week and slowly advance the time spent holding the contraction 4 x research source do decline static holds abdominal workouts are incredibly

body forms a slight u shape you should feel your shoulders back glutes and leg muscles all tensing to hold this position hold the superman pose as long as you can and repeat 2 3 times do shoulder flexion exercises this particular isometric exercise will help strengthen your shoulder muscles 9 x research source stand straight facing a wall bend one arm at a 90 degree angle and make a fist with that hand press your fist to the wall as if you were trying to push the wall away from you although this exercise mainly works your arms and shoulders tense your back muscles and abdominal muscles for support hold this position as long as you can and repeat 2 3 times try adding in a split squat this exercise is great because it strengths and works multiple joints it combines hip flexion hip extension core stability and lower body strength all great for boxers or fighters to begin this exercise position yourself in a half kneel position this is similar to when you re lunging forward with one leg and have dropped your back knee until it s almost touching the ground make sure your front knee is bent at a 90 degree angle and your knee tracks over your ankle also keep your torso straight up and rigid squeeze your thighs glutes and core as your hold this position repeat 2 3 times on each side include a static chin up with your hands facing you chin ups can be a difficult exercise they work your arms shoulders back and core muscles this is another great exercise for fighters start this exercise as you would with any typical chin up place your hands on the bar with palms facing you at about shoulder width apart slowly pull yourself up and stop once your chin is just over the bar hold your body here this position requires you to contract many muscles at once but ensure your core is also tight repeat this position 2 3 times to make this position more difficult while you re holding the chin up extend your legs straight out in front of you so they are parallel to the floor squeeze your hip flexors and thighs to help stabilize this position perform pull ups with an overhand grip this exercise will work your back and biceps with more emphasis on your back place your hands on the bar slightly wider than shoulder width apart with your palms facing away from you slowly pull yourself up and stop when your chin is just above the bar pause then slowly lower yourself back down all the way 10 x research source repeat for 3 sets of 12 include adequate cardio boxing is not necessarily considered an aerobic sport it actually uses the anaerobic system more than the aerobic system however it s still important to include cardio to round out your training running a low amount of miles 1 2 a few times a week is recommended if you re boxing sprinting 1 2 times a week is recommended alternating between jogging and sprinting for a hiit high intensity interval training workout is good for fighters as this taxes both the aerobic and anaerobic systems 11 x research source try jumping rope this is a fun and higher intensity form of cardio that s great for fighters or boxers it can help increase speed agility and coordination 12 x research source balance isometric exercises with other forms of strength training while isometric exercises are great to round out your strength training workout include other forms of training to ensure you re working your body appropriately include training with weights for compound exercises this type of strength training will recruit multiple muscle groups and joints to build both strength and mass 13 x research source plyometrics is a type of strength training that can aid fighters especially boxers it relies on power generated through muscle contraction before an explosive and forceful movement 14 x research source it can help improve reactive strength which is important to the sport examples of plyometric exercises include box jumps jumping jacks and clap push ups include rest and recovery days like all exercise rest and recovery days play an important part in your progress take ample time off from you isometric exercises during the week some fitness professionals recommend only doing isometric exercises a maximum of 3 4 times per week 15 x research source many isometric exercises don t leave you feeling sore however do fatigue your central nervous system this needs to be rested as well after being taxed with isometric exercises 16 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to win in an unarmed combat situation,social situations especially those involving alcohol have the potential to turn ugly should conflict arise street fighting is not a pretty business and conflict of this sort can end badly if one is caught unprepared with the right knowledge a fight in the street can be controlled and handled effectively leaving you relatively unharmed and safe from prosecution,first of all it is imperative that you assess your situation going into a fight blind will never end well assess why your adversary is picking a fight and if he is alone intoxicated or armed if possible defuse the situation by keeping calm and backing down it is better to keep a fight verbal as opposed to physical under most circumstances while you are talking to your prospective opponent walk away from him take the argument outside which not only puts distance between you two but will draw a crowd you need witnesses to testify that you didn t start the confrontation or escalate it into violence you will also lessen the probability of him having easy access to a weapon of opportunity pool stick bottle when you get outside do not let your opponent get near you keep a halo of around 3 feet 0 9 m around yourself which will keep you out of striking distance move around walk around but do not allow yourself to be backed into a corner don t walk backwards which can lead you to trip or fall but instead walk sideways so you can see where you are going while still keeping your opponent in your sight keep your body language passive with your hands unclenched and your voice low and calm shouting and clenching your fists is pretty much asking for a fight if your opponent advances quickly towards you a fight is imminent as soon as he breaks your halo strike and strike decisively do not give him the opportunity to hit you first landing the first blow gives you a semblance of control over the situation and will put your opponent off guard and on the defensive there are no rules in a street fight if the opportunity presents itself strike below the belt a solid kick to the groin followed by a knee or fist to the face of your bent over opponent will end the fight do not worry about looking pretty or trying to box the idea here is to incapacitate your opponent and to stop him from causing you harm not to show off in the real world fights do not look like they do in the movies assume you will get hit it will hurt it will scare you and put your body into survival mode the best thing you can do is take the punch somewhere where it will not take you out of the fight or cause you real harm take a punch to the top of your head your arms or your forearms get in close to lessen the force and the impact of the blow while giving yourself leverage to counter attack if you are not trained in martial arts or some sort of self defense system do not under any circumstances try to replicate what you may have seen on tv or the movies attempting complex holds chokes or strikes without proper training will only leave you open should your opponent have a working knowledge of counters or reverses always assume that your opponent is trained to fight never underestimate him once you have incapacitated your attacker get away the idea is to buy yourself time to get away from a potentially serious conflict not to beat your opponent senseless once he is out of the fight get away and stay away if you are stopped either during the fight or immediately after by law enforcement you have a much better case for self defense if you only used the necessary force to secure your safety,Sports-and-Fitness
how to stop wrist pain when punching,throwing a punch can do a lot of damage to your target but if you re not careful it could hurt you as well whether you re sparring defending yourself or practicing on a punching bag using the wrong form when you re punching can lead to wrist pain or even injury in addition to paying close attention to your technique you can also incorporate wrist strengthening stretches and exercises into your workout routine,keep your thumb outside of your fist when you re making a fist for punching start by folding your fingers into the palm of your hand then wrap your thumb around your knuckles it will likely rest on the first knuckle of your middle or ring finger depending on how long your thumb is 1 x research source close your hand tightly enough that your fist will stay closed when you hit but don t squeeze so tightly that your hand shakes or you cut off your circulation never wrap your fingers over your thumb the force of the punch will put intense pressure on your thumb joint and you could break or dislocate your thumb don t put your thumb on top of your second set of knuckles either since that s where you ll make contact with your target always be sure that your pinky finger is tucked into your palm if it s sticking out when you throw a punch it could also be broken or dislocated hold your fists up in front of your face before you throw a punch raise your forearms so they re almost vertical with your hands near your face not only will this help you defend yourself but it will be easier to maintain good form during your punch if you start in this position 2 x research source check to make sure that your arms form a straight line from your elbows all the way to your knuckles generate power from your legs when you punch instead of using your arms to punch as hard as you can move your dominant foot slightly away from the target which should turn your body at a slight angle bend your knees slightly and as you start punching pivot on your back foot then push off with it 3 x research source this will help propel you forward and will create some of the power for the punch since you won t have to swing your arm quite so hard you may be less likely to feel pain in your wrist afterward do not bend your wrist as you hit keep your arm and wrist as straight as possible while you re swinging at your target when you make contact don t let your wrist buckle or bend if your wrist is at an angle when you hit your target you could injure yourself 4 x research source try squeezing your forearm slightly just before you contact your target this will help stabilize your wrist however don t tense up your shoulder arm or wrist before you throw the punch or it will throw off your accuracy and power 5 x research source keep your elbows in close to your body as you re hitting and don t overextend your body that can help you feel more in control of the punch so you might be less likely to hit too hard and hurt your wrist strike with your first 2 knuckles as you re throwing your fist aim so that you hit your target with the knuckles on your first and index fingers these knuckles are stronger than your ring and pinky fingers so you re less likely to injure your hand and you ll also get more impact with less force so the hit will be easier on your wrist 6 x research source if you re keeping your wrist straight as you strike hitting with your first 2 knuckles should feel natural you can hold your fist so your fingers are vertical or you can rotate your hand inward at about a 45 angle pull your fist back quickly after you make contact don t try to drive your fist all the way through your target that s going to put extra pressure on your wrist instead try to keep your punches snappy connect with your target then quickly pull back and move your hand back in front of your face 7 x research source in addition to helping protect your wrist this technique allows you to land multiple blows rapidly snapping your punches will also help you get your hands back up to protect your face more quickly even if you re working with a punching bag or another stationary target it s a good idea to practice defending yourself warm up with wrist stretches before you start training stretching your wrists before you workout can help you avoid injuries while you re practicing your punches in addition you can do stretches in your free time to help you strengthen the muscles in your forearms and wrists here are a few stretches to try wrist rotations close your hands into fist then make small circles with your wrists first go clockwise for about 30 seconds then reverse directions and rotate counterclockwise for 30 seconds 8 x research source prayer stretch press your palms together in front of you similar to the way you might pray then lower your hands until you feel a stretch in your wrists hold that stretch for about 30 seconds then release wrist flexor stretch hold one arm out in front of you with the palm up then bend your wrist backward until your hand is pointed at the floor use your other hand to gently press on the hand that s bent until you feel a stretch hold that for about 30 seconds then switch hands wrist extensor stretch this is the same as a wrist flexor stretch but you start with your palm facing down bend your wrist forward until your fingers are pointed straight down then use your opposite hand to press gently on the back of your hand until you feel a stretch hold the stretch for 30 seconds wrap your wrists to stabilize them loop an elastic hand wrap around your thumb then wrap it behind your hand and around your wrist 3 times next pass the wrap between your thumb and forefinger and around your hand 3 times loop back across your wrist and under your thumb once more then bring the wrap over the back of your hand and between your pinky and ring fingers 9 x research source protect your fingers by crossing the wrap between your thumb and index finger then make an x by wrapping all the way around your wrist beneath your thumb and back up make the same xs between your ring and middle fingers and your middle and index fingers as well finish by passing the wrap around your thumb then around your knuckles 3 times and back down around your wrist once more hold the wrap in place by securing the velcro fastener right at your wrist most adults need a wrap that s about 180 in 460 cm long if you have very small hands however use a 120 in 300 cm wrap wear boxing gloves on top of your hand wraps for more protection there are a lot of different types of boxing gloves out there but if you re just getting started it s a good idea to start with a basic training glove these gloves are versatile so you can use them to protect your knuckles thumbs and wrists for both sparring and bag training 10 x research source boxing gloves are sold by weight training gloves are sold in sizes from 12 18 ounces a 16 oz glove is a good weight that will suit most people but talk to your trainer if you re not sure what s right for you wear mma gloves if you d prefer more direct contact mma gloves are fingerless gloves that come down just far enough to cover your first knuckle they ll protect your knuckles and provide some stability for your wrists as you re hitting but you ll have more freedom of movement than if you re wearing boxing gloves 11 x research source because they re designed to help you condition your hands and wrists these gloves won t protect your wrist as much as wraps or boxing gloves be sure to start out slowly when you first start wearing them take breaks between rounds when you re training it can be easy sometimes to get caught up in what you re doing however it s important to remember to take a 1 2 minute break after each round of sparring or bag training that will give your hands and wrists time to recover so you may have less pain afterward 12 x research source for instance if you re in a sparring match with a partner you might box for a full 3 minute round then stop for 1 minute prioritize exercises that will improve your grip strength working your grip will strengthen the muscles in your hands and forearms this can make your whole wrist area stronger as well which could help prevent some wrist pain when you re punching 13 x research source for example you might try farmer s walks where you hold a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells at your side then walk 50 100 ft 15 30 m other exercises include pull ups chin ups deadlifts chest presses and shoulder presses you can also use a hand grip strengthener which is a device that you squeeze repeatedly this is a great way to improve your grip strength in your downtime like when you re watching tv perfect your form with a punching bag working on a punching bag is a great way to condition your hands and wrists to be stronger while you re hitting don t worry about hitting the bag as hard as you can instead focus on improving your speed by keeping your punches as snappy as possible if you do that you ll increase your hitting strength over time 14 x research source be sure to use proper form when you re hitting the punching bag do wrist curls to strengthen your forearms holding a 3 5 lb 1 4 2 3 kg weight in your hand sit on a chair or bench turn your palms face up and rest your forearms on your thighs then slowly raise and lower the weight by bending your wrist repeat this for 3 sets of 15 reps 15 x research source you can do this with both hands at once or you can isolate one hand at a time if you prefer try wrist rolls to strengthen your grip hold a wrist roller in front of you a commercial wrist roller looks almost like a pair of handlebars with a cord attached to the center with a weight dangling from the end of the cord grip the roller firmly then rotate your wrists to roll the cord around the handle keep wrapping the cord until the weight touches the handle then unroll it slowly by rotating your wrists the other way 16 x research source do this first one way then the other for about 3 5 reps to make your own wrist roller take a sturdy rod like a broomstick be sure not to use anything flimsy that might snap then tie a strong string to the center of the stick and tie the other end to a 5 10 lb 2 3 4 5 kg weight,Sports-and-Fitness
how to rack a pool table,so you wanna play pool racking the billiard balls in correct fashion will help you play the game right and let you feel in command as the game begins although racking is relatively simple there are some rules and tricks to racking properly read on for more information on how to rack a clutch of billiard balls the right way,start off with the 1 ball at the front of the rack this is also called the apex of the rack 1 x research source make sure that the 8 ball is in the center of the rack the center of the rack is the middle of the triangle this should be the third row down counting from the top 2 x research source make sure the bottom corner balls are a stripe and a solid it doesn t matter which is which as long as you ve got one stripe and one solid 3 x research source place all the other balls at random make sure the 1 ball is at the apex the 8 ball is in the middle of the rack and both a stripe and solid are at the bottom corner but line up all the other balls in random fashion if solids and solids are together or stripes and stripes that s okay one variant of this step in amateur play is to vary the edges of the rack so that the pattern is stripe solid stripe solid etc this will result in the two corner balls being the same i e either both stripe or both solid another variant of this step in amateur play is to order the balls down and from left to right according to their number this will always result in the 1 ball being at the apex the 11 and 15 being at the bottom corners and the 5 ball being in the 8 s customary position line the apex the first ball up with the middle diamond on the side of the pool table the center of the first ball should be in the middle of the table at one quarter of the length some tables have this spot marked with a small dot 4 x research source make sure that the balls are tightly packed together a tight rack makes for an infinitely better break preserving the tightness of the rack lift the rack from the balls you re ready to start your 8 ball game if possible get a diamond shaped rack for 9 ball since the racking technique is different in 9 ball from 8 ball a different rack is preferred the pattern of a diamond is 1 2 3 2 1 the traditional triangular rack may be used for racking a 9 ball game but it will produce a looser rack 5 x research source in all variants of 9 ball keep the 1 ball at the apex and the 9 ball in the center the 1 ball is always at the front of the rack and the 9 ball is always directly in the center 6 x research source place all other balls in random order around the 1 and 9 ball like in 8 ball traditional rules state that all other balls are placed randomly 7 x research source one amateur variant of 9 ball is that the billiard balls are placed in sequential orders down and from left to right excepting the 9 ball which stays in the middle if done properly the 1 ball will be at the apex and the 8 ball will be at the bottom,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hold a pool cue,if you want to be a pool shark or just to impress your lady with your skills on a date then the first thing you have to know is how to hold a pool cue properly if you don t hold it correctly you can end up hitting the ball way off the mark or even off the table so it s important to get the basics down before you become a pro,hold the pool cue at your hip with your dominant hand place one hand at the point on the stick close to the rear where it is balanced there will usually be tape there place your hand approximately 4 to 5 inches 10 2 to 12 7 cm back ideally your back hand should be at a 90 degree angle with your cue 1 x research source most beginners start off by gripping the cue too tightly your grip should be relaxed and yet controlled your body should be in line with the cue ball this will help you aim your shot correctly hold the stick using your thumb and index finger and add your middle finger if you d like a bit more power lower yourself to the table once you grip the cue with your dominant hand and find your shot you should lower your body toward the table so you re staring down the line of the cue ball you won t be able to make your shot if you re stiff and upright 2 x research source keep your legs relaxed slightly bent and at least a few inches apart make an open bridge with your other hand place your other hand about 6 8 inches 15 20 cm away from the cue ball down on the table the closer you are to the ball the more precision you ll have with your shot once your hand is down you will make a bridge or a cradle with your hand that will allow you to balance the cue on your hand and hit your shots though certain bridges work better in certain situations it s best to be familiar with the most common bridge the open bridge first 3 x research source for the open bridge a bridge is formed by placing your hand on the table and spreading your fingers apart slide the cue between your index and middle finger knuckles or in the v that is formed between your thumb and index finger the pool cue is supported by the v between the index finger and thumb you can adjust the height of the cue tip by raising or lowering the arch of the hand this allows the cue to slide as you aim it at the ball hold the cue steadily as you eye up the target ball lean forward and mentally place the cue on the spot on the cue ball that you want to hit techniques for hitting the cue ball in the right spot for specific shots can be perfected later ideally you should hit that cue ball in its center or on the sweet spot of the ball so it goes where it needs to go make sure you can see a direct line between the cue ball and the object ball the ball you re aiming for hold the pool cue at the balance point and take your shot slide the cue forward while aiming steadily if you feel uncertain about the shot then you can gently move the cue back and forth on your bridge to feel more steady and balanced before you take your shot instead of trying to take your shot right away remember that you want to strike the ball not poke it follow through with your shot by continuing your motion slightly after taking the shot 4 x research source keep your body low to the table until you ve finished taking the shot grip the pool cue in a loose and relaxed manner don t tighten up during the shot if the grip is too tight the cue may jerk and change the direction of your shot hold the pool cue with your hand gripping it from the outside and use your thumb on the inside as support this provides you with better control use your thumb index and second finger of the other hand to hold the cue in place use the closed bridge the closed bridge is a more advanced technique that can be used for more accented shots needless to say it will also help you look more like a pro but it s important to do it right here s what you need to do place your front hand on the table while making a fist spread your pinkie ring and middle finger while leaving your index finger tucked lift your index finger and slide the thumb underneath it slide your index finger over your thumb to create a loop place your cue through the loop while keeping the tip of your thumb pressed against the tip of your index finger use a rail bridge when the cue ball is 4 6 inches 10 15 cm away from the rail this bridge can be helpful when you don t have enough room to make a traditional bridge because the ball is too close to the end of the table here s how you do it place your hand on the rail itself lift your index finger over your thumb and place it on the other side of the cue stick so that your thumb is on one side of the stick and your index finger is on the other use the rail for bottom stability take your shot use a rail bridge when the cue ball is just 1 2 inches or so 2 5 5 cm away from the rail if the ball is so close to the rail that even the traditional rail bridge is not possible then you can use a different version of the rail bridge to make your shots here is what you can do place your palm against the edge of the rail place your index finger flat over the rail guiding the cue on one side place the tip of your thumb on the other side to guide the cue on the other side this time your thumb and index fingers will be in their normal positions with the cue in the middle take your shot using the rail for bottom support use an elevated bridge to elevate over a ball this can help you hit that cue ball when it is being nearly blocked by another ball here is all you have to do to hit this shot plant your index finger down on the table almost perpendicular to it plant down your pinkie finger while tucking your middle and ring fingers under forming a tripod lift your thumb upwards forming a v channel between your thumb and index finger in the air place the cue between your thumb and index finger and take your shot use a mechanical bridge the mechanical bridge is perfect for shots where the ball is too far out of reach they can be much more useful than trying to overreach and missing that shot because you re off kilter don t be discouraged by the affectionate alternative names crutch or granny stick there s absolutely nothing shameful about using a mechanical bridge here s how you use it place the bridge flat on the table behind the cue ball place the cue in the groove that will give you the best shot hold the butt cap of the stick with your thumb index and middle finger place your head down into the line of the shot and take your shot,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play pool like a pro,to play pool like a pro you need a good pool cue a fluid stroke and precise aim whether you re a casual pool player or you want to become accomplished this article will give you the basic toolkit that you need to become better at billiards,check your hand position hold the thick end of the cue in your dominant hand with your palm facing upward find the spot on the wrap where the cue evenly balances grip your cue about 1 behind that spot make a circle with the thumb and index finger of your non dominant hand put the cue through the circle and rest it on the top of your middle finger behind the knuckle spread out your pinky ring and middle finger tips to create a tripod like support place the ridge of your hand should on the table lift the other side of your hand a bit higher assume the proper stance place the foot that is on the same side as your non dominant hand in front position your other foot about 2 feet 60 cm behind the front foot turn your body slightly away from the table so that it doesn t interfere with the shot position yourself close to the table but not too close to it you want to lean into the shots a bit for more control proper form requires the cue stick to be directly below your chin during a stroke if you compare the form of a professional pool player with that of a novice pool player the professional player will always keep their head down also known as being down on the ball with the cue directly below his or her chin during the stroke chalk the cue tip before every shot as though you re brushing the chalk on with a paintbrush avoid twisting the chalk on top of the cue hold your cue parallel to the table for maximum control accelerate gradually as you approach the ball imagine that you are moving your arm through the water in a swimming pool instead of hitting the ball with a quick strike a longer stroke imparts more momentum to the ball keep your follow through straight and relaxed the cue should continue on its course and almost hit the table ahead of the ball s starting position your cue shouldn t slow down until the tip has actually hit the ball stay down after the shot this position allows you to analyze the angle of the ball and the direction of every other ball that it strikes it also ensures that you don t cause the shot to deviate by accidentally introducing a jumpy motion practice your stroke without actually striking balls until it feels comfortable imagine an invisible ball next to the ball that you want to sink into the pocket place your cue above the target angle the cue so that it creates a parallel line from right above the cue ball to the target back your cue up and place the tip on the table where the center of the invisible ball the one you imagined next to the real ball would be maintain the angle that you just made when you lined up the ball and the pocket keep the cue tip on the table pull the rest of the cue around to the right or left until the cue is positioned over the white ball you now have the angle at which you need to hit the white ball to sink the other ball set your shot up at the angle you just calculated strike the center of the white ball so that it makes contact with the other ball start playing with your non dominant hand all the time until a little after the time you become ambidextrous it will make you less likely to win the current game but more likely to win future games sometimes in pool you get a shot that would be an awkward angle with your dominant hand but your non dominant hand will gain skill faster for those awkward shots if you play with your non dominant hand all the time than if you just do it for those shots in fact skill transfers somewhat from one task to another task to your non dominant hand will gain skill for pool faster if you you do everything with your non dominant hand than if you just play pool with your non dominant hand like in other activities feel the wrap or butt of the cue choose a larger wrap if you have large hands and a smaller wrap if you have small hands the most important point is to find a wrap that feels good in your hands if your hands sweat choose a cue wrapped in irish linen for absorption otherwise choose a leather wrap or a cue with no wrap check the shaft most shafts have a diameter of 12mm to 13mm while 13mm is the most commonly selected size a smaller shaft can make the bridge position more comfortable for people with smaller hands measure the pro taper the shaft maintains its diameter for 10 to 15 before it starts to taper toward the cue a shorter taper gives you a firmer hit know the cue weight most players choose a weight between 19 and 20 ounces check cue length most cues are 57 or 58 long but you can special order different lengths pick your cue tip cue tips are made of leather and generally rated medium to hard a tip that will wear well gives you better control of the ball make sure no parts are loose any loose parts will absorb the energy from your shots and will hamper your ability to strike the ball well,Sports-and-Fitness
how to disassemble a pool table,disassembling a pool table takes the right tools and a fair amount of muscle a standard home pool table has a wood frame heavy slate bed and leather drop pockets coin operated tables tables with ball return mechanisms and tables with a fiberboard surface are much harder to take apart,detach the pockets from the table remove the pocket liners if present remove the screws or staples that attach the pocket straps to the table if you don t have a staple remover pry the staples out with a flathead screwdriver leave the pockets in place for now this is usually easier from under the table wear goggles to protect against falling staples 1 x research source remove the rail bolts underneath each rail there are usually three or four bolts under each rail 2 x research source remove them with a socket wrench old pool tables may have special bolts with two holes to remove these order a forked tool from a pool table supply store remove the rails and pockets pull apart any rail sections that detach easily and set them aside if two rails are attached at a corner flip them over onto the table with another person s help then pull apart the two sections set aside the pockets as well set the rails down carefully when flipping them and take care to avoid bashing the side pockets 3 x research source detach the felt from the slate bed the felt is usually either glued down or stapled to the wood backing of the slate if it is stapled remove each staple carefully to avoid tears if glued pull the edge of the felt backward very gently never up or forward working your way around the table 4 x research source once you ve removed the felt fold it carefully to avoid wrinkles and creases do not press the fold lines 5 x research source if the felt is wearing out consider tearing it off and installing new felt during reassembly remove the slate screws with a drill these screws are usually at the corners of the table but could be along the sides and center beam as well 6 x research source if you find beeswax or putty over the screws carefully scrape it off with a screwdriver to reveal the screw head without scratching the slate lift each slate and place to the side most tables have a playing surface made from three slate slabs and each one can weigh 250 lbs 110 kg 7 x research source get a couple friends to help out and move them as carefully as possible a scratch or chip in one slate could ruin the table requiring an expensive replacement for all three slates 8 x research source one piece slates can weigh up to 800 lbs 360 kg 9 x research source enlist several strong people to help you move these disassemble the frame flip the table over and unbolt the legs take apart the final lightweight pieces and you re ready to go transport the slate carefully the most difficult part to transport is the slate tabletop which is both heavy and fragile recruit several strong people to load the slate onto a furniture dolly on its side fasten the slate in place tightly with a furniture strap if transporting by truck fasten the strap around the slate and onto the truck slats 10 x research source if at all possible load it into the truck using a liftgate if you put the pool table in storage choose a climate controlled storage unit or a room with minimal variation in temperature and humidity lay the slate onto plastic sheeting and tape more plastic sheeting over it store the carefully folded felt in a sealed plastic bag and all other components in moving blankets or other protective materials remove only the rails and legs from a coin operated table remove the rail bolts with a socket wrench and detach them from the table if two lengths of rail are connected at a corner you may need to flip them over before you detach them gently carefully flip the table over and unbolt the legs do not attempt to disassemble the rest of the table without professional help since removing the coin operated mechanism can make reassembly difficult or impossible some valley dynamo coin operated tables have a metal trim covering the rail bolts remove the screws holding the trim in place slide the trim toward the corner then lift them up and out use caution with ball return systems most tables with a ball return system are also coin operated but some tables from the 1970 s or 80 s have a simpler mechanism 11 x research source in some models removing the mechanism without damaging the table is difficult 12 x research source unless you have a manual for your model leave the ball return mechanism attached during transport you can usually disassemble the rest of the table as described in the standard slate table instructions transport non slate tables in one piece if your pool table surface is made from fiberboard mdf wood or any other non slate material it is most likely a low cost disposable table these are not usually meant to be disassembled not even by a professional 13 x research source transport the table in one piece some of these tables have folding legs to make transport easier,Sports-and-Fitness

for a small dot or triangle in the lateral center of the felt about a quarter of the way down the length of the table this is where you will place the cue ball to begin the game the line that runs through this point is called the head string 2 x research source rack the balls find the triangular pool rack and place the 1 15 balls inside arrange the rack at the opposite end of the table from the head spot with one corner of the triangle facing the break make sure that the rack is laterally centered along the foot string then when you are ready to play remove the racking frame so that only the balls remain place the point of the triangle three quarters down the length of the table at the foot spot the dot on the tabletop that corresponds to the head spot if the head string marks the 1 4 point from the head of the table to the foot then the foot string is an imaginary line that marks the distance 3 4 of the way from the head to the foot the food spot is located at the exact midpoint of the foot string line 3 x research source set the 8 ball in the center of the triangle put the 1 ball at the point of the triangle facing the break place a stripe ball in one back corner of the rack and a solid ball in the other corner learn the lingo pool is rich with unique terminology that can be difficult for new players to understand reference the terms as you learn to play if you aren t sure what something means ask a veteran pool player to clarify object balls the striped and solid balls numbered 1 15 every pool ball but the cue ball the object balls are the balls that you are trying to knock into the pockets pocket the baskets along the rim of the pool table there are six pockets one in each corner and one at the midpoint of each long side pocketing is the act of knocking one or more numbered object balls into a pocket rail the bank along the side of the pool tabletop scratch when a player accidentally knocks the cue ball into a pocket if you scratch remove one of your sunk balls from a pocket and place it back in the center of the table your opponent now has the chance to shoot from his or her chosen spot at the top of the table open table the table is open when the choice of groups stripes or solids has not yet been determined when the table is open it is legal to hit a solid first in order to make a stripe or solid foul penalty opposing player gets the cue ball in hand this means that the player can place the cue ball anywhere on the table to take his or her next shot break the rack one player lines up the cue ball behind the head string and aims at the rack knock the cue ball into the triangle of balls with force and precision to execute a legal break shot the breaker must either pocket a ball or drive at least four numbered balls to the rail when the breaker fails to execute a proper break it is a foul 4 x research source know what to do in case of a scratch or foul if the breaking player scratches on his or her shot then the game has only partially begun in the case of a foul the incoming player has two options accept the table as is and take the next shot or re rack the balls for a redo of the opening break the incoming player gets to choose whether to personally break or to allow the original breaker to try again 5 x research source if a player scratches on a legal break shot all balls pocketed remain pocketed the shot is a foul meaning that it is now the other player s turn to shoot the table is open meaning that the first player to sink a ball without scratching chooses that ball type stripes or solids as his or her objective for the game if a player jumps a numbered ball off the table on the break shot it is a foul the incoming player has two options accept the table in position take the next shot and continue the game take the cue ball in hand behind the head string shoot or break again as necessary if the 8 ball is pocketed on the break then the breaker may ask for a re rack or have the 8 ball spotted and continue shooting if the breaker scratches while pocketing the 8 ball on the break the incoming player has the option of a re rack or having the 8 ball spotted and begin shooting with ball in hand behind the head string choose groups before groups are chosen the table is open the first player to sink a numbered ball effectively chooses to aim for that group of balls throughout the rest of the game if you are the breaking player for instance and you sink the striped 13 ball then you are stripes look around for other striped balls that are easy to strike your goal is to pocket all of the striped balls and then the 8 ball before your opponent pockets all of the solid balls and the 8 ball 6 x research source make it clear who is who if you make a stripe call out i m stripes if you make a solid call out i m solids if you are the first player to pocket a numbered ball but you sink both a stripe and a solid at the same time you have your pick between the two groups choose the group that looks the most immediately advantageous keep shooting until you fail to pocket a ball if you are shooting on stripes and you make the striped 12 ball then it is still your turn try to pocket another striped ball if you successfully pocket another striped ball on your next shot then you can shoot again as soon as you scratch or miss the pocket however it immediately becomes your opponent s turn there is no rule against combination shots in which you sink two numbered balls from your group with one shot however the 8 ball can not be used as a first ball in the combination unless it is the shooter s only remaining legal object ball on the table otherwise it is a foul pocket all of the balls in your group if you are shooting solids then try to make all of the balls numbered 1 7 so that you can pocket the 8 ball if you are shooting stripes then make all of the balls numbered 9 15 if you make your opponent s ball then your turn ends in a scratch call your shots in many official pool games players must call each shot they take in order for that shot to be legal this means before each shot announce which ball you are going to knock into which pocket you might say 4 ball corner pocket and indicate with your pool cue to make it clear which pocket you mean 7 x research source if you are playing a casual game of pool with friends then there is no need to call your shots pocket the 8 ball you can only legally shoot at the 8 ball once you have made all of the other numbered balls in your group stripes or solids make sure to call your pocket look over the table and decide which pocket will be the easiest place to sink the 8 ball then announce where you are going to pocket the 8 ball before you shoot if you are the first to legally pocket the 8 ball then you win the game 8 x research source for instance say 8 ball corner pocket and indicate which corner pocket you mean if you call your shot but you do not make the 8 ball into a pocket it is now your opponent s turn to shoot you have neither won nor lost unless you make the 8 ball or scratch while trying to make the 8 ball finish the game a game of 8 ball pool ends when a player legally sinks the 8 ball after pocketing all of the numbered balls in his or her group however a player can also lose the game by committing certain infractions a player loses when he or she pockets the 8 ball at any point after the break pockets the 8 ball on the same stroke as the last of his her group of balls jumps the 8 ball off the table at any time after the break pockets the 8 ball in a pocket other than the one he she has called or pockets the 8 ball when it is not the legal object ball,Sports-and-Fitness
how to felt a pool table,replacing the felt or more accurately the pool tablecloth is often left to professionals but the tools used are not expensive or complicated the reason some consider it difficult is the exacting requirements of a pool table a stretch in the wrong direction or a little dust left on the table can make your final playing surface bumpy or unpredictable you can minimize the chance of this happening by working slowly and carefully and finding an assistant to stretch the cloth as you fasten it,begin disassembling the pool table remove the pocket liners from each pocket first if any are present next find the bolts on the underside of the table keeping the railings in place and remove them move the railing carefully to a safe storage space where it won t get scuffed or damaged or interfere with your movement around the pool table the railing may be composed of one two or four pieces if the railing does not divide into four pieces you will likely need an assistant to transport it safely some pool table pockets are bolted or screwed on separately from the railings remove the old felt felt can be attached in more than one way use a staple remover if the felt is stapled to the table if it is glued you can simply rip the felt off but be careful not to damage any felt in the pockets unless you also plan on replacing those portions as well level the table optional you may wish to use a level to test whether your billiards table is flat if it is not use a small pry bar to lift the lowest leg and add a wooden or metal shim clean the slate use a dry clean cloth to remove dust do not use any water or cleaning solutions if old glue or other residue has built up scrape this off with a putty knife or other flat blade especially where it may block pockets 1 x research source seal the seams with beeswax if necessary most pool tables are constructed from three pieces of slate on an old pool table the seams between these may have lost some of the wax that fills them in to create a flat surface if the wax needs replenishing heat the slate around the seams with a propane hand torch then drip wax into these seams spread the wax evenly across the seam line let it cool for no more than thirty seconds then scrape excess wax down to the level of the table surface using a paint scraper 2 x research source it s better to remove too much wax than too little since excess wax can be difficult to remove once dry if your pool table is kept in a warm location you may wish to use putty specifically formulated for pool tables there is a great deal of disagreement over which of these synthetic products produces the best quality table so you may wish to consult a local expert familiar with your climate measure your pool table before purchasing felt measuring will take the guesswork out of sizing your felt resulting in a faster process and a cleaner result when you purchase the felt or more technically the pool tablecloth for your table make sure it is at least 12 inches 30 5 cm longer than the table on all four sides this ensures that you will have plenty of cloth for the railings as well as the table surface note that pool felt is actually a special type of cloth and while it is commonly referred to as felt it is usually sold as pool tablecloth pool cloth or billiards cloth you cannot use ordinary felt to cover your pool table woolen pool cloth is the pool felt most players are familiar with worsted cloth allows for greater speed but is rarely used outside of professional tournaments due to its lessened durability and price other varieties such as snooker cloth carom or polyester cloth are only suitable for certain uses 3 x research source use this method if there is a wooden or particle board backing many tables have a wooden or particle board layer beneath the slate allowing staples to be attached you can check whether this is true of your table by examining the perimeter or vertical edge of your table if there is only slate use the instructions for gluing the felt instead note you will need a hammer tacker or manual stapler or a staple gun cut the felt into pieces for the table and railing typically the felt comes in one large piece and includes instructions for removing pieces to fit each railing follow these instructions carefully or the cut pieces may not fit your table with some felt you can make a one inch 2 5 cm cut then rip the felt by hand in a straight line 4 x research source other felt may require cutting with a razor blade or box cutter roll the felt out face up over table look for a sticker or other label that tells you which side is face up if it is unlabeled and you cannot easily tell which side is the playing surface consult a professional different types of felt have a different feel so it s best not to guess if you are not familiar with the feel of that type hang more of the extra felt over the foot end and not much on the head end where you will begin installation check now for rips scratches or other defects that could require you to get a refund or replacement stretch the felt across the head end and staple it on the vertical edge in several places use your hammer tacker or staple gun to attach the felt to the wooden or particle board lining of the table at one corner of the head end have an assistant help you stretch the felt across the head end until there are no wrinkles present keeping the overhang parallel with the table edge staple about every 3 inches 7 5 cm along this stretched edge ending at the second corner professionals play on a very tightly stretched surface which allows for greater speed this is not necessarily desirable for most players however who may enjoy playing on a slower table always stretch at least tightly enough to remove all wrinkles however repeat the process on the left side move to one of the long sides of the table and have an assistant help you pull the felt taut along its length staple at roughly 3 inch 7 5 cm increments but make sure to staple on either side of the side pocket pulling the felt over each pocket when stapling on either side will give you extra material to work with when lining the pockets staple on the foot end then the right side pull the felt tight from the last unstapled corner pay special attention to this as an inconsistent pull can cause wrinkles in your table if the previous staples make it impossible to create a flat surface with this pull with the overhang parallel with the table end you may need to remove a couple staples with a staple puller and try again once this is pulled to a smooth surface with the desired tightness staple the short foot end and remaining right sides along their lengths 5 x research source 6 x research source remember to staple on each side of the side pocket trim the material at the pockets and staple it inside make three slits in the felt directly over each pocket then fold the loose felt down into the pocket and staple it inside the pocket once this is done use a pair of scissors or a razor blade to snip off the excess felt use specialized spray adhesive if the table cannot be stapled if your table has no wooden or particle board backing underneath the slate surface you ll need to find a specialized adhesive to glue the felt to the slate instead if you do see that backing follow the instructions for stapling the felt instead 3m super 77 multipurpose adhesive is a popular option cover the sides of the table with newspaper protect the edges of the table from spilled glue with a layer of newspaper overhanging the edge 7 x research source remove newspaper from each edge just before you lower the glued felt cut the felt according to the manufacturer s instructions felt usually comes in one large pieces along with instructions for cutting off strips for each railing follow these instructions to ensure you end up with pieces of the correct size identify the playing surface and place the felt over the table if the face up surface is not labeled try to identify it by feel or consult a professional your felt playing surface may be smooth or it may have a nap in one direction depending on the type you may need to have an expert identify the face up side if you are not familiar with the material arrange the felt over the table leaving only a couple inches a few centimeters of overhand on the short head end make sure each overhang is as parallel to the table edge as possible fold the head end of the felt up and apply glue fold the head end of the felt over onto the table exposing the underside that will hang over the vertical side of the slate spray that portion of the underside heavily with the adhesive and spray the slate where it will be attached as well 8 x research source let this sit until it becomes tacky according to the adhesive manufacturer s instructions carefully attach the felt to the table starting at one end align the glued felt carefully with the slate press down then move along the glued end pulling tightly as you attach it to the table you may need an assistant to ensure the material is taut especially at the beginning of the process the felt should be tight enough to prevent all wrinkles but an ultra tight surface is not necessary unless you want to practice for professional tournaments most importantly you should pull the felt with the same pressure throughout this installation repeat the process with the far end and the long sides the gluing process is identical for each of the remaining three sides wait at least a couple minutes between each side or however long the adhesive manufacturer recommends to create a strong initial bond carefully pull each side taut before you apply glue making sure there are no wrinkles on the cloth and you are pulling with the same force on every side trim the felt and use the excess to line the pockets trim the excess felt overhang on each side one one side cut a one inch 2 5 cm wide strip of material for use as pocket liner cut off the material stretched over the pockets then cut this strip into smaller pieces gluing them over the vertical circular surface of the slate to protect it from the pool balls remove old felt from rails use a staple puller or flathead screwdriver to remove the staples from the ends of the rails cut the old felt along the top of the rail if it does not come off immediately 9 x research source gently remove the wooden feather strip each rail has a thin wooden featherstrip running alongside it which is typically not attached by any adhesive or nails if it won t come up easily use a thin flathead screwdriver to pry it up without breaking it place a new strip of felt over the rail unlike the table top this felt should be face side down keep an overhang of at least 4 inches 10 cm on each end and 1 2 inch 1 25 cm over the feather strip groove 10 x research source use a tapping block and hammer to wedge in the center of the featherstrip lay the featherstrip back in position but do not press it down have an assistant stretch the felt tightly between the center and one end of the railing place a tapping block over the featherstrip then use a hammer to gently tap the block pushing the featherstrip down into the stretched portion of the felt but stop about 2 inches 5 cm from the end where the corner pocket will be located 11 x research source stretch the other half of the felt and repeat this process for the remaining length of the featherstrip again stopping 2 inches 5 cm away from the other end do not strike the featherstrip directly or you may dent the table pull felt toward the cushion and tap in the ends of featherstrip pull the felt at the ends of the table toward the rubber cushion then tap in the remaining portion of the featherstrip until it is firmly in place trim and fold the felt as necessary to remove excess material and cover the ends of the cushion reassemble the outer rails once all your rails are complete bolt them to the table again if you re having a hard time finding where the bolts should go you can push a screwdriver through the bolt holes as guidance never try to cut holes in the playing surface from the top of the table as you may cut in the wrong place,Sports-and-Fitness
how to rack in 8 ball,there are a number of variations to the game of 8 ball pool but all of them begin the same way first you rack the 15 numbered balls inside a triangular rack and then one of the players shoots to break them getting the balls in the right order might seem confusing but it s actually fairly simple when you know the rules,let the player who will break first rack the balls in a recreational game toss a coin or do a lag test to determine who will break and rack to do the lag position 1 ball on either side of the table and have each person shoot to the other end cushion the person whose ball hits the cushion and bounces back closest to the spot where they shot their ball will pick who breaks in a professional game the player with the lowest official standing in the league always breaks first if possible you can have a player who isn t playing rack the balls and act as a referee for the game locate the black and white dot at the end of the pool table most pocket billiard tables are marked with a foot spot in the center of one end of the table about halfway between the corner and side pockets the foot spot is the spot furthest from the end of the table where the players stand during the break shot 1 x research source if the table doesn t have a marked foot spot use the markings around the edge of the table to determine where it would be the spot should rest on the centerline of the table when you re standing at a short end the spot will align with the 2nd mark on the edge of the table between the corner and side pockets place the triangle rack with the top point over the foot spot the rack is an equilateral triangle so it doesn t matter which point you put over top of the foot spot make sure you can see the black and white dot touching the top of the interior of the triangle this spot is called the apex of the rack 2 x research source ensure the center of the ball that is placed in the apex of the rack will be exactly in the middle of the dot there are other rack shapes like the diamond but those aren t used for 8 ball pool position the rack so that the base is parallel to the short end of the table once you have the apex positioned on top of the foot spot make sure the bottom of the triangle is straight the corners of the rack should be equal distances from the corner pockets on their side of the table if the base is crooked this can cause one of the sides of the rack to have a greater chance of going into a pocket place any ball other than the 8 ball inside the triangle at its apex pick any one of the 7 striped or 7 solid balls and position it on top of the foot spot inside of the rack many players like to use the 1 ball at the top of the rack but there are no official rules regarding which ball should go at the apex this is different from 9 and 10 ball pool which both require the 1 ball to be at the apex of the rack place a solid ball in one corner and a striped ball in the other corner pick any one of the remaining striped and solid balls to put them in the corners to provide an equal chance of one of them going in a pocket it doesn t matter which number the ball has on it as long as it isn t the 8 ball if one of the balls goes into a pocket on the break the player can choose to keep shooting for that type of ball or they can choose the other type for instance if the solid 6 ball went in the pocket the player would be able to keep shooting solids or they can choose to shoot stripes instead if both the striped and the solid balls go in a pocket on the break the player who shot first gets to choose which type of ball they d like to continue playing for fill in the space between the corners with the rest of the balls place the balls in any order of solids and stripes filling in any of the open spaces and making sure not to move any of the previously placed balls most players position a solid and a stripe in the lower 2 spots of the inner triangle 3 x research source some players choose to alternate between solids and stripes as much as possible to make sure both solids and stripes have an equal chance of going in the pocket on a break place the 8 ball in the center of the third row of the rack this is done to reduce the likelihood of the 8 ball being pocketed on the break skip a row under the apex ball and place the 8 ball so that it s vertically aligned with the apex ball 4 x research source if the 8 ball is pocketed on the break the player who didn t break would receive an automatic win for the game placing it in the center of the rack reduces the likelihood of this happening roll the rack up and down to ensure that it is packed tightly push your fingers into the rack under the bottom row of balls and then slightly push the rack forward pull the rack back again so that the apex ball is aligned with the foot spot and the base is parallel to the back of the table if the table has flaws that prevent you from placing the apex ball directly over the foot spot the upa s rules allow you to place it within a dime s radius half the width of a dime of the foot spot lift the rack up off of the table without moving the balls take your fingers out of the rack and place them on either side of the rack lift the rack directly up off the table to avoid touching or shifting the balls if you re having trouble try lifting the back end of the rack and pushing the apex forward and away from the balls before you lift it up this will give you more space to move as you lift the rack,Sports-and-Fitness
how to level a pool table,a pool table must be level for the balls to roll evenly across the felt an uneven pool table will prevent accuracy in players shots and will allow the balls to roll to one side or area of the table with a few items from a home improvement or hardware store such as a carpenter s tool and some shims you can level your pool table use these tips to level a pool table,use a carpenter s level if you ve noticed your billiard balls making strange curves measure your pool table for level the best way to do this is with a basic carpenter s level analog or digital levels both work fine analog carpenter levels usually have bubbles that will orient between two lines when the surface is level and will skew to one side when the surface is crooked these are great for telling not only whether or not your table is crooked but by how much and to what direction 1 x research source if you don t have one there are free or very cheap apps you can get on most smart phones with quite accurate level functions use one of these instead and just lay your phone on the surface you want to check for level measure the mid line of the pool table set the carpenter s level in the middle of the pool table oriented long ways if the pool table is balanced from end to end the bubbles in the carpenter s level will be situated between the two lines in the middle of the glass tubes 2 x research source if the bubbles in the glass tubes are above or below the middle lines you will need to raise or lower one of the shorter ends of the pool table measure the shorter mid line of the pool table turn the level the opposite direction in the middle as well perpendicular to the long sides of the rectangle and even with the shorter sides this will help you measure the side to side level of the table take a measurement if the bubbles are above or below you ll also need to adjust the legs in that direction to make the table flat 3 x research source set the carpenter s level on each of the sides of the pool table most of the time the problem with pool tables is that one leg or multiple legs is lower than the other three legs on the table to find it put the level close to the edge of each of the four sides of the pool table to get a more accurate reading move to each side and each corner of the pool table checking with the level for the severity of the lean the corner with the most lean is the one you re looking for in some cases you ll get weird readings because the floor of the house may be less than level if that s the case you can still make adjustments in the same basic way it ll just take a little more troubleshooting to get it right use a ball to check for practical balance roll the cue ball over a section of the table as straight as possible move your eye even with the plane of the table to look along the path of the ball see whether the ball rolls off course towards one particular side of the table or if it moves true repeat the process on a few sections of the table adjust the table if the ball is rolling off course towards a particular side if necessary this method requires that you move the ball extremely straight which is somewhat difficult and less accurate than a level if you try this check your results against a carpenter level to be sure use a flat piece of glass and a marble to calculate balance another way of checking for level that doesn t involve a level is to set a piece of glass in the middle of the pool table and let a marble roll across it place a marble on the middle of the piece of glass the ball should stay in place if the pool table is level adjust the table if the ball rolls off of the glass towards a particular area of the table 4 x research source repeat the process on every side of the table place the glass and marble 2 to 3 inches 5 to 7 6 cm from every pocket on the pool table find the lowest corner the level should dip or the ball should move in the same direction at both corners on the same side if the level dips in one more than the other that s the corner you need to adjust if the level doesn t turn it the other way and check for level on the perpendicular side when you locate the lowest corner put the 8 ball in that pocket so you ll be able to remember which one it is consult your owner s manual if you have it most pool tables are made to be adjustable so you can make them level regardless of what surface they re on some pool tables may have metal plates which can be added or removed to raise or lower the sides other pool tables have adjustable legs with feet that can be screwed clockwise or counterclockwise to raise or lower that side your owner s manual will provide specific information about your pool table if you don t have the manual just look at the legs to see how they re put together and whether or not they have adjustable components if your pool table does not you can still use shims and other tiny adjustments to level the table if the table features screw in feet or legs they ll usually be raised by turning them to the right and lowered by turning them to the left but always defer to the owner manual to be sure tighten all attachment screws under the table sometimes the bolts and screws used to assemble a pool table can loosen slightly over time resulting in the table becoming off level if you tighten up all the attachment screws you can sometimes level out the table without even adjusting the height pool tables involve any number of different screws and screwdrivers to tighten look at the screws themselves to figure out what you need or consult the owner s manual raise the lowest table leg one degree if your pool table is adjustable raise the lowest corner of the pool table by one degree the least it can be adjusted leave the carpenter s level on the pool table and check for the change if that was too much and the table has been unleveled in the wrong direction lower it back to where it was and use shims to make smaller adjustments more on this in the next section adjust the other table legs if necessary sometimes you ll have to make lots of little tweaks on different sides to get the top of the table completely level it s partially a trial and error process so don t get discouraged leave the level on the top of the table and check for level after every adjustment you can also leave the over adjusted leg as it is and use shims on the over levels if you d rather it s partially a trial and error process use shims to fine tune the level shims are small tapered shards of wood that you can use to fill gaps and adjust the height of things like pool tables they re commonly sold in the carpentry sections of any hardware or home goods store usually in packages with variable sizes 5 x research source you can trim the shims to fit underneath the feet of the table if necessary to make sure that they don t show if the feet are big enough though you may not need to worry about it get a few helpers if you need to add shims have one or more assistants lift the corner of the table that needs to be raised carefully place a shim underneath the leg lowering the foot onto it gently use the carpenter s level to check the balance of the pool table see how the shim has affected the level of the top continue to add shims underneath the legs until the pool table is balanced move to other corners if necessary to make other adjustments quit while you re ahead pool tables don t need to be absolutely flat for them to work well enough to play on if you can get it close enough but not totally perfect don t keep adding and removing the same shim over and over roll a couple balls to see how true they move if it looks good to you go with it do the marble and glass test again if it sits still you ve got a playable table,Sports-and-Fitness
how to move a pool table,moving a pool table takes a lot of effort if you are moving it around your home and will be most easily accomplished by several able bodied people working together moving a pool table to another house or storage area will require the help of others as well but you will also the right tools and patience,acquire four wooden dollies these wooden wheeled wonders make moving heavy objects a cinch you ll want to wrap the edges of your dollies in carpet or fabric this will prevent the legs of the pool table from being scratched 1 x research source 2 x research source position your equipment distribute your dollies around each corner of your pool table to prepare each for being slid under its legs clear the area around the pool table so that there are no objects that might get caught in the wheels and make it difficult to slide the dollies into place when clearing objects from around under your pool table don t forget to remove any throw rugs which can bunch and hamper the rolling of your dolly lift one end of your pool table up you should be able to do this alone but since pool tables are heavy a friend can considerably lessen your effort tilt the pool table off the ground from one of the longer sides 3 x research source lift with your legs to prevent injury to your back move your dollies into place if you are doing this alone snag the dolly with your foot and push it into place beneath the pool table be sure not to overexert yourself in this maneuver or lose your grip dropping your pool table can damage it if you are working with a friend have him roll the wooden dolly into place repeat this process for both legs of the end of the pool table that you are lifting brace your dollies when you raise the other end of your pool table you will be applying force to the pool table that might cause it to roll backwards on the dollies you have just placed you ll want to prevent this by locking the wheels or by placing an object to jam the wheels of your dollies rendering each stationary lift the other end of your pool table into a raised position double check that your dollies are within foot reach or that your friend is ready to slide the dollies into place then lift the other side of the pool table move the other two dollies beneath both legs of that end of your table free your braced dollies and prepare to roll unlock or unblock the two dollies now you should walk the path on which you plan on wheeling your pool table measure all doors that you ll have to pass through and check these measurements against the width of your pool table move carpets and other items that might bunch or otherwise jam the wheels of your dollies a jammed wheel can jostle your table and do damage to it you a wall or one of your possessions 4 x research source apply firm steady pressure you want to control the speed at which your table rolls due to the considerable weight of your pool table if it gains too much speed it will be nearly impossible for you to stop if you have a friend each of you should push the pool table from opposite corners of the same side and in a controlled fashion move it through your home if you are doing this on your own you ll want to take a more central position probably at the end of the longways side between the two corner pockets the weight of the pool table will make it difficult to turn corners take this into account when moving it through your home brace a set of dollies you ll want to remove the dollies opposite your braced dollies first before you do anything check the position and alignment of your pool table once you take the table off the dollies it will again become difficult to move retrieve your dollies lift from the middle of the long side of your pool table and have your friend quickly pull the dollies free then you should carefully lower it to the ground if you are doing this alone you should be able to easily kick the dollies free and then slowly in a controlled fashion to prevent damage lower your table once one set are removed you can unlock the wheels of the dollies at the opposite side and remove these in the same fashion remove the pockets every standard pool table with have 4 corner pockets and 2 side pockets depending on the design of your pool table these could be attached to the table in various ways though usually you ll find staples attaching each to the table lay on your back underneath the pocket and pry the staples out with a flathead screwdriver or staple puller to prevent an errant stable falling into your eye you do not lie directly under the pool table and you might consider wearing some kind of eye protection detach the rails again the part holding the rails to your table depends on your table but chances are good that bolts will be holding these in place you can remove these bolts easily with a regular socket wrench 5 x research source 6 x research source slide each rail free if the rails are attached in sections you may need a helper to flip them over all at once and disconnect them free the felt this is the most delicate part of the process as a tear to your felt can ruin it completely if the felt is held in place by staples a staple puller may help prevent you from incurring damage to the felt glued felt can be removed by gently pulling it backwards never upwards or forwards taking care not to rip it 7 x research source if you are planning to reuse the felt fold it up to prevent wrinkles separate the slate from the table there will likely be screws holding the slate of your pool table to its frame these can be most effectively removed with a power drill that has been fitted with the right type of bit in some cases beeswax is used on the screws to prevent damage if this is the case use a flathead screwdriver to scrape off the beeswax before unscrewing the slate place the slate in your vehicle the rock that forms the level surface upon which you play pool must remain unblemished to protect the integrity of your future games slate usually comes either in a solid piece or three pieces 8 x research source lift the slate off the pool table legs and set it in your transport vehicle it s safe to stack the pieces of slate on top of each other but be sure each are properly fastened and don t jostle against anything the might cause damage to make sure that your slate is undamaged you should wrap it in a blanket drop cloth or some other covering remove the legs now that the delicate parts of your pool table have been removed and stowed away taking the legs off the frame shouldn t pose a problem likely your trusty drill will come to your aid again and with a proper bit soon the legs will be off 9 x research source load the frame you can set the frame on top of the slate in your vehicle if you have a finished table with lacquered wood you may want to wrap the finished surfaces with a drop cloth or some kind of padding to protect against damage transport it to its new home any remaining parts should be manageable at this point and shouldn t require any further disassembly finish loading these parts into your transport vehicle and move your table to to the new location scope out the new location you should take measurements so you can be sure your table will fit comfortably wherever you move it but even more important you ll want to clear the area in which you are setting up the pool table and the path to this room getting tripped up by a throw rug when you re carrying the slate is a good way to ruin a perfectly good pool table 10 x research source rebuild your table in reverse order you will want to take great care when assembling your pool table improper installation can leave it unlevel which will affect your game starting with your frame and legs begin reassembling your table for specific issues dealing with leveling warping and cracked or damaged slate please see the section on troubleshooting place the slate the slate is one of the most difficult and delicate pieces in your pool table due to its weight any damage done to the slate can ruin your pool table single pieces of slate will install more easily since you ll only have to slide it into place for pool tables with three piece slate parts move each piece to your mostly assembled table setting each atop it with space between the pieces then check to see the pieces haven t been damaged and fit together neatly are the dowel pins that connect the pieces bent or warped if so you may have to make a trip to the hardware store to buy a few new dowels slide each of the three slate pieces together with the proper connectors between and slot the assembled slate into its place on the table take care to not get your hands caught between pieces of slate this can cause serious injury to hands and fingers check for twists or frame tension especially with older pool tables where the frame may be difficult to deconstruct over the course of your move you may have caused the configuration of the frame to shift this could create difficulty when inserting the slate use a level to check that the frame is still properly shaped you may also want to use a carpenter s square to check the corner angles of your table 11 x research source take warps in stride older tables or tables that have sat in one location for a long time may have experienced warping or may have conformed to the natural contours of the home in which it lived this might mean that you need an additional piece separate from the parts of your pool table to balance it and negate any rocking you may notice once the table is moved when choosing a piece to balance a rocking pool table you need to choose a material that won t compress under the weight of it scrap steel or a sturdy tile might do the trick re level the table buildings frequently have a slight pitch to them and pool tables to combat these potential angles will often have adjustable feet after you ve taken care of the frame configuration and any major imbalances you can move on to leveling the table have a friend hold the level atop a flat part of the frame and take the level reading if the table isn t level lift the end that needs adjusting have a friend adjust the leg in the appropriate direction set the pool table down check the level reading again and repeat if necessary fix the slate significant damage to the slate of your pool table is likely to require a professional repair or even replacement but small chips or cracks might be within your ability to mend for small cracks or chips mix some plaster of paris and apply it to the area while larger cracks can be patched with automotive body filler after your patch has hardened you ll need to sand your patch level level slate in a warped frame there is little you can do to your table if the entire frame has warped to the point that the slate now sits in its mounting on an angle the slate on the other hand can be adjusted after fitting the slate together and fixing any damage you can cut thin wedges of wood called shims and use these to level your slate 12 x research source know how to handle antique rails some older pool tables will use special bolts to connect the rails to the narrow edge of the slate to remove and attach the rails of an antique pool table a t bolt wrench will make the process much easier,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play pool like a mathematician,billiard balls collide with nearly perfect elasticity this means that the kinetic energy in their motion is almost completely preserved and very little of it dissipates into heat or other energy sinks this makes pool and billiards a great sport to analyze mathematically if you have perfect control over how you strike the cue ball and where to aim it you can always predict what will happen,understand the law of reflection many pool players already know this simple mathematical lesson since it comes up every time you carom the cue ball off a rail this law tells you that the angle at which the ball strikes the rail is equal to the angle the ball bounces off at in other words if the ball approaches the rail at a 30º angle it will bounce off at a 30º angle as well the law of reflection originally refers to the behavior of light it s usually written the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection 1 x research source set up the cue ball and object ball equidistant from the rail in this scenario the goal is to carom the cue ball off the rail and have it return to strike the object ball now set up a basic geometry problem as possible imagine a line from the cue ball to the rail intersecting at right angles now imagine the cue ball traveling to the rail this path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by your first line and a section of the rail now picture the cue ball bouncing off and hitting the object ball mentally draw a second right triangle pointing the opposite direction prove the two triangles are congruent in this case we can use the angle angle side rule if both triangles have two equal angles and one equal side in the same configuration the two triangles are congruent 2 x research source in other words they are the same shape and size we can prove that these triangles meet these conditions the law of reflection tells us that the two angles between the hypotenuses and the rail are equal both are right triangles so they each have two 90º angles since the two balls started equidistant from the rail we know the two sides between the ball and the rail are equal aim at the midpoint of the rail section since the two triangles are congruent the two sides that lie along the rail are also equal to each other this means the point where the cue ball strikes the rail is equidistant from the two starting positions of the ball aim for this midpoint whenever the two balls are an equal distant from the rail use similar triangles if the balls are not equidistant from the rail let s say the cue ball is twice as far from the rail as the object ball you can still picture two right triangles formed by the cue ball s ideal path and use intuitive geometry to guide your aim 3 x research source the two triangles still share the same angles but not the same lengths this makes them similar triangles same shape different sizes since the cue ball is twice as far from the rail the first triangle is twice as large as the second triangle this means the first triangle s rail side is twice as long as the second triangle s rail side aim for a point on the rail ⅔ of the way to the object ball since ⅔ is twice as long as ⅓ learn the basics most shots in pocket billiards are angle shots or cuts meaning the cue ball does not strike the object ball dead on the thinner more glancing the collision is the greater the angle the object ball will travel at relative to the trajectory of the cue ball estimate the fullness of the hit an excellent way to estimate this effect is to sight along the planned trajectory of the ball at the moment of collision how much will the cue ball overlap the object ball from your perspective the answer tells you how full the collision is a dead on shots overlaps completely you could say it has a fullness of 1 if the cue ball covers ¾ of the object ball the hit is ¾ full predict the angle based on the fullness the graph of these two quantities is not quite linear but it s close enough that you can estimate by adding 15º every time you subtract ¼ fullness alternatively use these more accurate measurements 4 x research source 5 x research source a direct hit fullness 1 results in a cut angle of 0º the object ball continues along the same path as the cue ball a ¾ shot sends the object ball out at 14 5º a ½ shot sends the object ball out at 30º a ¼ shot sends the object ball out at 48 6º use caution for very thin shots past ¼ fullness it becomes difficult even to estimate how much of the ball is covered more importantly the cut angle rises more and more steeply so tiny errors can have large effects these glancing shots require plenty of practice and good technique even once you ve figured out where to aim if you can look for another shot you can take aim with the ghost ball method instead if the description of fullness doesn t help you try the ghost ball approach 6 x research source imagine a straight line segment from the pocket to the center of the object ball extend this line slightly past the object ball imagine a ghost ball at this spot squarely on this line and touching the object ball to hit the object ball into the pocket you should aim at the center of the ghost ball follow the thirds rule for kiss shots a kiss shot involves caroming the cue ball off ball a so it can strike ball b if you re playing a game that allows kiss shots remember this rule if ball a is touching a rail the desired cut angle is ⅓ of the angle formed by the three balls 7 x research source for example if the angle with ball a as the vertex is about 45º the cut angle you want to achieve is about 15º the fullness rule above tells us that a ¾ full collision should produce this angle perfect your stroke first consistent stroke form and aim should be your first priorities when you start to take pool seriously english is a very useful technique but it has complex effects and you need consistency to practice it you ll have trouble narrowing down the effects of english side spin if you re not also controlling the amount of overspin and slipping these effects are determined by the height you strike on the cue ball slipping is completely eliminated at 2 5 of the distance between the center and the top of the ball but in practical terms 1 5 of this distance is often a better measure for optimal control and speed 8 x research source 9 x research source avoid english when in danger of sinking the cue ball as long as there is no english the cue ball will come to a dead stop after a perfect head on collision practice head on collisions striking the ball with your cue at the midpoint of its horizontal axis once you can get the cue ball to stop dead every time you have enough control to introduce english to your game practice different amounts of english there are several types of english but this article sticks to the most basic form if your cue hits the cue ball left of center the ball will spin along this axis this is left english when this spinning ball strikes a surface the spin will cause it to rebound further to the left than a ball with no english 10 x research source similarly striking the right side imparts right english and moves rebounds further to the right the further from center you are the more dramatic this effect 100 english or maximum english means you strike halfway between the center and the edge of the ball this is the farthest from the center you can strike and reliably avoid miscues 50 english means you strike halfway between the maximum point and the center ¼ of the way from the center to the edge of the ball you can use any other percentage of english by striking at different points between the center and the maximum point understand gearing when two balls collide the object ball starts rotating around a particular axis determined by the angle and the amount of english if you achieve gearing this rotation occurs along the axis of movement in other words the object ball s motion is not affected by spin it will travel exactly along the line of centers or the line drawn between the centers of the two balls at the moment of impact 11 x research source the term comes from the analogy of two gears meshing smoothly together transferring the motion perfectly adjust your english to achieve gearing for any cut once you ve aimed your angle shot using the fullness or ghost ball approaches from the last section you d like to ensure that the object ball doesn t pick up any funny spin and ruin your shot here s where a chart can save you a lot of trial and error all numbers below are for outside english meaning you move the cue to the side of the cue ball farther from the object ball 12 x research source if the cut angle is 15º use slightly more than 20 english remember the cut angle is the angle between the cue ball s original path and the path of the object ball if the cut angle is 30º use 40 english if the cut angle is 45º use about 55 english if the cut angle is 60º use about 70 english as the cut angle approaches 90º increase english to 80 know the effects of a collision without gearing if you use less english than the gearing amount listed in the last step the cue ball will slide forward during the collision transferring side spin to the object ball the object ball will move slightly to the right of the expected cut angle if you use more english than the gearing amount the object ball will move slightly to the left of the expected cut angle instead 13 x research source this effect is called cut induced throw the cut angle transferred a spin which threw the ball off the expected path you can use this to your advantage to make seemingly impossible shots if your only clear shot would put the ball slightly too far to the right increase the amount of outside english to throw the ball into the pocket,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play 9 ball pool,the simple rules and straightforward goal of 9 ball pool make it easy for new players to learn more advanced pool players might enjoy this fast paced change from other pool games and the opportunity to show off precise positioning skills all you need to get started is a standard set of pool table equipment,choose teams 9 ball is usually played one on one if you have more than two people divide into two teams in a friendly game you can play with three or more teams this is not recommended if some of you are much better at pool than others decide who goes first you can just flip a coin but lagging is a more entertaining way to decide the first player on an empty table every player places a ball just behind the head string each player hits his ball at the same time the goal is to have your ball touch the far end of the table then bounce back as far as possible without touching the near end or the sides whoever gets closest gets to break see below try again if two of the balls touch each other or if no one manages to hit the end without touching another side set up nine balls inside the rack pick out the nine balls numbered 1 through 9 and place them inside the rack arrange them in a diamond shape with the 9 ball in the center and the 1 ball closest to the shooter place balls in the rest of the diamond at random the rack goes in the usual place with the closest point on top of the foot spot if you can find a diamond shaped 9 ball rack use it if you have to use a triangular 15 ball rack just make the diamond shape as tightly packed as you can break have the first player set down the white cue ball anywhere behind the head string that player hits the cue ball at the 1 ball to break the break should pocket one ball and or send at least three balls to any rail side 1 x research source if neither of these happens set up the rack again and let the next player break instead take your turn until you fail to pocket a ball whenever you pocket a ball you get to take another shot continue taking shots until you fail to pocket a ball or you foul when this happens play passes to the next player this includes the break if the person who broke pocketed a ball they get to take another shot just like 8 ball you can only hit the cue ball usually a white ball with no numbers know your objective in 9 ball pool whoever pockets the 9 ball wins the game you can even win on the break this way of course there are other rules that makes this goal harder than it sounds aim for the lowest numbered ball every time you take a shot the cue ball must hit the lowest numbered ball still on the table before it hits any other balls if it hits a different ball first or if it doesn t hit any balls the shot is a foul see below for more info on fouls you can pocket any numbered ball without a penalty for example the cue ball can hit the 1 ball then bounce off and knock the 7 ball into a pocket this is a legal shot you can even pocket the 9 ball this way to win the game avoid soft hits after hitting the lowest numbered ball at least one ball must hit a rail or enter a pocket if this does not happen the shot is a foul 2 x research source place the ball anywhere if your opponent fouls if a player commits a foul the next player picks up the cue ball and places it anywhere on the table before making her shot 3 x research source as mentioned above fouls include hitting the wrong ball first or failing to drive any ball into a pocket or rail obey standard pool rules standard pool fouls also apply knocking a ball off a table pocketing the cue ball scratching touching a moving ball or hitting the cue ball out of turn are all fouls the next player gets to move the cue ball anywhere on the table if the 9 ball is knocked off or pocketed during a foul spot it back to the foot spot or as close behind the foot spot as possible other numbered balls that leave the table illegally stay out of play accidentally touching a non moving ball is not a foul but the other players get to decide whether to leave it in the new position or move it back play several games compared to other types of pool 9 ball plays ends quickly typically the players agree to play until one person or team has won a certain number of games try playing first to three games if you are new pool players or first to seven if you are intermediate or advanced add this rule for more competitive play the push out rule gives the players a little more control over the starting position following the break this adds more strategy to competitive matches in a friendly game involving beginner pool players this rule is not necessary declare push out right after a break the push out rule only applies on the first shot following a break the player about to take the second shot can choose to announce a push out if he does not announce it then play proceeds as usual if the shooter pocketed a ball on the break he may announce a push out since he s about to take another shot if he did not pocket a ball the next player gets the option to push out instead ignore the 9 ball rules for the push out on an announced push out shot the shooter does not have to hit the lowest numbered ball and does not have to send a ball at a rail or pocket 4 x research source if the push out pockets a 9 ball spot it back to the foot spot any other numbered ball stays in the pocket other foul rules still apply let the next player choose whether to play after the push out the next player chooses whether to play or to pass the turn she gets to make this decision even if the push out pocketed a ball after this decision play proceeds as usual if a foul occurred on the push out follow the usual foul rules instead the next player places the cue ball anywhere and takes a shot,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play bumper pool,pool also called pocket billiards is an indoor game of skill played on a large table the table used is so large that few private residences can accommodate a pool table to allow the play of pool in smaller areas the game of bumper pool was created it is played on a compact multi sided table upon which balls are struck using cue sticks to drive the balls into target pockets the sticks used in bumper pool are about half the length of full sized pool sticks as the shots would not be challenging over such short distances obstacles called bumpers are affixed to the surface of the table these bumpers must be circumvented for a player to get a ball into the objective pocket for that player use these tips to learn how to play bumper pool,prepare for play the game

how to choose a pool cue,if you need to buy a new pool cue there are a few ways to make sure you get the right one for you you ll need to establish a budget and decide between a one piece or two piece cue you should always hold a pool cue in your hand and check a few things before you buy it choosing a wrap selecting a cue weight checking the cue s straightness and testing the cue out on a pool table are all important,set a budget a good pool cue is not worth going into debt over so be honest with yourself about how much you can afford to spend on a cue having a specific price limit in mind will help you be more selective about what cue you choose for a quality cue on the low end of the price scale plan for about 100 1 x research source factors that affect the cost are the material the cue is made of wrap types and size if you are above average height and need a longer cue you may pay more professional cues can cost 500 or more but a cue like this is not necessary for a casual player select a one piece cue for home use one piece cues do not come apart so they are not meant for travel for a home pool table you don t need a cue that is made to travel one piece cues tend to be a little cheaper and they are the best option for home use it s not that one piece cues can t be taken somewhere but it will be inconvenient to take a nearly five foot stick in your car with you a potential disadvantage of a one piece cue is that they are more prone to warp over time buy a two piece cue for travel and competitive play if you are buying a pool cue so that you can play in tournaments outside of your own home it s wise to buy a cue that can be broken down into two pieces these typically come with some kind of carrying case to make travel easier you can still buy a two piece cue for home use if you find one that fits you well but it isn t necessary a benefit of two piece cues is that if the shaft begins to warp you can buy a new shaft and retain the butt of the cue pick a cue that is the right length for your height standard cues tend to be 57 inches for one piece cues or 58 inches for two piece cues but children or people of below average height should opt for a 48 inch or 52 inch cue players over 6 foot 5 inches tall may need to special order a cue that is up to 61 inches long 2 x research source hold the cue in your hand to feel the weight pool cues weigh between 17 ounces and 21 ounces with most players preferring either 19 ounce or 20 ounce cues the weight affects your shot so it s important to choose a weight that you can easily use 3 x research source most of the cue s weight is in the butt end because the butt is thicker than the shaft if you test the cue and it feels too heavy in your back hand then opt for a lighter cue short people tend to want a lighter cue because a heavier one will cause them to lower the butt and raise the cue s tip during the shot this results in not connecting solidly with the ball some players prefer a heavier cue for breaking and a lighter cue for skill shots choose a comfortable wrap the wrap is the part of the cue that you hold with your back hand since this is the part of the cue that you have the most skin contact with you want to be comfortable wrap options include leather and linen but some cues may not have a wrap at all if you tend to have sweaty hands when you shoot pool you want a grip rather than bare wood or fiberglass your best options are irish linen or leather which are both good for absorption rubber grips are also available but you want to make sure that the rubber is of high quality and feels smooth and dry without any stickiness rubber wraps might deteriorate faster than leather or linen wraps this is not something you can choose just by looking at it you need to hold the cue in your hand and choose a wrap that feels best to you look down the length of the cue to judge its straightness hold the butt of the cue at eye level and stare down its length slowly spin the cue to see around the whole surface look for any abnormalities in the cue only buy a cue that is perfectly straight 4 x research source most pool cues are manufactured to a high standard so it s unlikely that you ll find a new cue that is crooked but it is still good to check it is sometimes recommended to roll the cue along a flat surface to see if it rolls smoothly but this is not always a valid test as you can t tell for sure if the surface is perfectly flat choose a tip tips come in soft medium and hard each tip type offers a slight difference in play soft tips are great if you put a lot of spin on the cue ball hard tips tend to last longer but are less capable of ball spin medium tips are fairly standard on new cues 5 x research source soft tips tend to misshape and wear out faster so if you do not want to keep an eye on them and perform more frequent maintenance don t get a soft tip hard tips are more prone to glance off of the cue ball when you strike it off center if you typically shoot more toward the outside of the ball a hard tip is not your best option take practice shots on a pool table if you are buying from a store that has tables set up you should test the cue you choose before you buy it get into a proper shooting position and take four or five shots with the cue 6 x research source if the store does not have tables set up or they won t let you practice ask what the return policy is so that you can play a game or two with the cue before you make a final decision you won t be able to tell if a cue is right for you unless you play with it opt for the stick with the least vibration within your price range listen to the sound the cue makes hitting the ball and feel the vibration in your hand if you hear a loud click when you strike the ball you will probably also feel a strong vibration a softer pop sound means less vibration higher end cues will make more of a soft pop sound when they hit the ball and this corresponds to less vibration running through the stick into your hand vibration affects the smoothness of your shot so you want to find a stick with low vibration,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play billiards,billiards games are divided into 2 types carom billiards played on a pocketless table in which the object is to bounce the cue ball off other balls or the table rails and pocket billiards played on a table with pockets in which the object is to sink the colored balls into the pockets by striking them with the cue ball aka pool 1 x research source if you re looking for pocket billiards wikihow has a great how to play pool article too but here we ll cover the basics of carom billiards and its variations in addition to equipment and strategy carom billiards involves serious skill often incorporating angles and trick shots if you already know pool carom is the next step,grab a partner and a billiards table carom billiards of any variety requires two people it can be played with a third but standard carom is with two you ll need your standard billiards table 4 feet 1 2 m by 8 feet 2 4 m 4 1 2 feet 1 4 m by 9 feet 2 7 m 5 feet 1 5 m by 10 feet 3 0 m or 6 feet 1 8 m by 12 feet 3 7 m without pockets this without pockets thing is pretty important you could play on a pool table pocket billiards but you ll soon find that the pockets get in the way and could potentially ruin the game here s everything you need to know and some things you may not when it comes to the table those diamonds are for you to use if you know your geometry you can use them to aim your shot we ll cover that in the next section strategy the rail by where the first player breaks is called the short or head rail the opposite rail is called the foot rail and the long rails are called the side rails the area behind which you break behind the head string is called the kitchen 2 x research source the pros play on heated billiards tables the heat gets the balls to roll more smoothly it s green so you can look at it for long periods of time apparently humans can handle green better than any other color determine who goes first by lagging that s where you each line up your ball near the baulk cushion the short end of the table where you break from hit the ball and see who can return it closest to the baulk cushion as the ball slows to a stop the game hasn t even started yet and it takes skill 3 x research source if you hit the other player s ball you forfeit your chance of calling who starts if you do win the lag it s generally accepted that you go second the player who breaks generally wastes their turn setting up the balls not taking a strategic shot set up the game you ll each need a cue stick for starters you had these for the lag right billiards cues are actually shorter and lighter than their pool counterparts with a shorter ferrule the white part near the end and a thicker butt 4 x research source then you ll need three balls one white cue ball heretofore called white one white cue ball with a black spot on it spot and one object ball typically red sometimes a yellow ball is used in place of the spot the person who wins the lag calls which ball they d like to be theirs cue ball the white or the spot it s just a matter of personal preference the object ball red is then placed at the foot spot that s where the point of the triangle would be in pool by the way the opponent s cue ball is placed at the head spot where you normally break from in pool as well the starting player s cue is then placed on the head string in line with the head spot at least 6 inches 15 cm from their opponent s cue so obviously when your ball is in line with your opponent s it s very hard to hit both balls on the table hence why if you win the lag you opt to go second determine the rules you and your partner want to play by as with any game that s centuries old there are variations in play some make it easy some make it hard and some make it faster or slower how much time do you have on your hands and how much skill for starters every type of carom billiards involves getting a point by striking both balls on the table it s how you do that that changes in straight rail billiards as long as you hit both balls you get a point this is easiest in one cushion billiards you must hit one cushion one side of the table before the second ball is displaced in three cushion billiards you must hit three cushions before the balls roll to a stop balkline billiards removes the one flaw in this game if you manage to get both balls into a corner you could presumably hit them off of each other over and over and over balkline billiards stipulates that you cannot receive points from a shot where the balls are in the same area often the table is divided into 8 sections of the table once you determine how you get points decide at what point you d like to stop in one cushion that number is generally 8 but three cushion is so hard you ll have better luck with 2 play the game move your arm smoothly back then forward in a pendulum motion the rest of your body should remain still as you stroke through the cue ball letting the cue come to rest naturally there you have it all you gotta do is hit both balls to receive a point technically each turn is referred to as a cannon but here are some more specifics the player who goes first must hit the red ball it d be weird to hit the other anyway if you score a point continue shooting playing slop accidentally getting a point is generally regarded as illegal always keep one foot on the floor at all times jumping the ball is a foul as is hitting a ball when it s still in motion look for the place on the cue ball where the cue tip should connect you can do this while taking your practice strokes line up your cue stick with where you would hit the ball if you could hit it directly then aim for that spot most often you ll want to hit the cue ball squarely in the center sometimes you may want to hit the ball to one side or another to impart sidespin or english to it to make the ball travel to one side occasionally you may want to hit the cue ball below center to cause it to climb over a ball you don t want to move and strike a ball you do want to move grip the cue stick correctly your shooting hand should grip the butt of the cue stick in a loose relaxed manner with your thumb as a support and your index middle and ring fingers doing the gripping your wrist should point straight down to prevent it from moving sideways when you take your shot your shooting hand should generally grip the cue stick about 6 inches 15 cm to the rear of the stick s balance point if you re short you may want to move your hand forward of this point if you re tall you may want to move it further back place the fingers of your off hand around the tip to form a bridge this prevents the cue stick from moving sideways when you shoot there are 3 main grips the closed the open and the rail bridge in a closed bridge you wrap your index fingers around the cue and use your other fingers to steady your hand this allows for more control over the stick particularly with a forceful forward stroke in an open bridge form a v groove with your thumb and forefinger the cue will slide through and you will use your other fingers to keep the cue from moving sideways the open bridge is better for softer shots and is preferred by players who have trouble making a closed bridge a variation of the open bridge is the elevated bridge in which you raise your hand to lift the cue over an obstructing ball when striking the cue use the rail bridge when the cue ball is too close to the rail for you to slip your hand behind it lay your cue stick over the rail and keep its tip steady with your off hand align your body with the shot line yourself up with the cue ball and the ball you want to hit the foot corresponding to your shooting hand right foot if you re right handed left foot if you re left handed should be touching this line at a 45 degree angle your other foot should be a comfortable distance away from it and forward of the foot matching your shooting hand stand a comfortable distance away this depends on 3 things your height your reach and the location of the cue ball the further away the cue ball is from your side of the table the longer you ll have to stretch most billiards games require you to keep at least 1 foot 0 3 m on the floor when shooting if you can t do so comfortably you may either need to take a different shot or use a mechanical bridge to rest the tip of your cue stick in when you shoot position yourself vertically with the shot your chin should be rest slightly over the table so that you re sighting down the cue stick as close to horizontal as comfortable if you re tall you ll need to bend your forward knee or both knees to get into position you ll also need to bend forward at the hips either the center of your head or your dominant eye should line up with the center of the cue stick without tilting some professional pool players do tilt their heads however most pocket billiards players put their heads 1 to 6 inches 2 5 to 15 cm above the cue stick while snooker players have their heads touching or almost touching the cue the closer you bring your head the greater your accuracy but at a loss of range for the back and forward stroke look for your best shot this depends all on where the balls lie on the table in carom billiards games that allow it you want to take shots that gather the balls together so you can score repeatedly by bouncing them off one another in other words not balkline take a look at the angles and how it all lines up take into account the cushions if you need to too sometimes your best shot isn t a scoring shot offensive shot but to shoot the cue ball to a place where your opponent has difficulty making a scoring shot that is a defensive shot take a few practice strokes if you need them this will limber up your arm before the actual shot get to know the diamond system yep math but once you get it down it s fairly simple each diamond has a number you take the number of the diamond the cue would hit initially called the cue position and then subtract the natural angle the number of the diamond on the short rail this leaves you with a number the number of the diamond you should be aiming for play artistic billiards yep it s a thing this is where players aim to complete 76 set up variations all of various levels of difficulty so when you ve got the game down set yourself and your friend up some trick shots who can complete the most difficult ones if one cushion billiards is doable try moving to two three is near impossible even for the pros if you can handle two you should start playing for money strike the cue ball in different ways how the cue ball strikes another ball can determine the direction the other ball travels this effect is called throw and can be caused either by the angle at which the cue ball strikes the other ball how much english was imparted to the cue ball or both billiards players who ve practiced and studied the effects of their shots make use of this when they play pool take some time to experiment the more you see how many options you have the better you ll get and the more fun the game will be take your carom billiards skill and start playing pool 9 ball 8 ball or even snooker,Sports-and-Fitness
how to clean billiard balls,do you play billiards a lot then your billiard balls will be covered in chalk you should clean them because if the chalk builds up it may affect play follow this guide to clean the billiard balls and i wish you future billiards luck,acquire a bucket a good few 3 or 4 gallons 11 4 or 15 1 l will do 1 x research source fill it with water fill bucket about 3 4s of the way up for every 10 parts water put in 1 pack of detergent soak the billiard balls for about 5 minutes take each ball out of the bucket and sprinkle a bit more detergent and polish with a rag towel dry each ball with a dry towel,Sports-and-Fitness
how to sink the 8 ball on the break,sinking the 8 ball on the break requires a skilled practiced shot the breaker the player that breaks the rack or triangular formation of pool balls with the white cue ball aims to knock the 8 ball into a pocket on the opening shot in some variations of pool sinking the 8 ball on the break can lead you to an automatic victory over your opponent but be careful not to scratch or pocket the cue ball,determine the rules of the game if you are playing against an opponent agree upon a set of rules before racking the balls in many versions of the game pocketing the 8 ball on the break guarantees the breaker an automatic victory however if you pocket the 8 ball on the break and scratch the cue ball you will automatically forfeit the game to your opponent 1 x research source decide which player will go first determine if you or your opponent will be the breaker if you have trouble deciding flip a coin or play play rock paper scissors rock paper scissors rack the balls place the rack on the table situating the rack s apex on the foot spot and position the balls correctly inside the triangle for a standard game of eight ball pool the 1 ball is placed at the rack s apex and the 8 ball is located in the center of the triangle one bottom corner must contain a solid and the other corner must contain a stripe the numbers on these two balls do not matter all other balls are randomly placed within the rack make sure the rack is tight the balls should be close together determine if you will break from the right or the left side if you are right handed you may want to try breaking from the left side of the table if you are left handed you may want to try breaking from the right side of the table 2 x research source try shooting from both sides of the table to figure out what is the most comfortable option for you locate the head string the head string is a line that goes across the table from side rail to side rail the line connects the second diamonds on the head end and passes through the head spot a point equidistant from both side rails 3 x research source pool tables have four rails or sides a head rail a foot rail and two side rails pool tables are have two ends the head end and the foot end pool tables have three strings or imaginary lines the head string the center string and the foot string these lines are never drawn on the table the head string is nearest the head rail the area between the head rail and the head string is called the kitchen on the break the cue ball may be placed anywhere within the kitchen or along the head string the center string connects the pockets on the side rails the foot string falls between the second diamond on the foot end the foot string passes through the foot spot a point that falls equidistant between the two side rails the apex of the rack is placed on the foot string each end has three diamonds place the cue ball the cue ball s exact placement depends upon the length of the table if these placements aren t working for you try moving the cue ball along the side rail or towards the center of the table remember the placement of the cue ball isn t wrong if it works for you for a nine foot table place the cue ball one ball s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and three ball s width from the head string into the kitchen for an eight foot table place the cue ball one ball s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and two and one half ball s width from the head string into the kitchen for a seven foot table place the cue ball one ball s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and two ball s width from the head string into the kitchen 4 x research source aim for the second ball on either side of the head ball position your body arms and cue stick in line with the second ball on either side of the head ball if you are breaking from the right you will try to hit the second ball to the right of the head ball if you are breaking from the left you will try to hit the second ball to the left of the head ball apply english or sidespin to sink the eight ball on the break you need to apply english or sidespin to the cue ball this is an advanced technique that affects the curve and throw of the cue ball imagine a clock face on the side of the cue ball facing you if you are breaking from the right rail use low left english hit the cue ball at approximately 7 00 if you are breaking from the left rail use low right english hit the cue ball at approximately 5 00 mastering english requires a lot of practice it is important to be patient while you work on developing this skill some experts recommend hitting the cue ball at 6 00 while others suggest hitting the cue ball at 6 30 or 5 30 avoid hitting the head ball it will cause the 8 ball to go in the wrong direction hit the cue ball with a draw stroke the draw shot is ideal when applying lower right or left english this stroke causes the cue ball to reverse its path back towards you after it hits a pool ball in your case the second ball to the right or the left of the head ball keep your cue level your grip loose and follow through with the tip of the cue down the amount of force required will vary from person to person while professional players break at about 36 mph 58 km h it is possible to make the shot by breaking at half the speed experiment with different amounts of force and remember that what works for you may not work for other people this is an advanced stroke practice practice practice and be patient the follow through is what causes the cue ball to roll back to you sink the 8 ball on the break while the cue ball should come back towards you the 8 ball should roll into the side pocket of the rail opposite of

how to play snooker,snooker is one of the most popular parlor games in the world a variation of billiards it is played on a felt covered table with six pockets lining the perimeter the object of the game is to sink a group of colored balls in the correct order using a thin wooden cue snooker requires considerable precision and concentration and the complexity of its rules makes it harder to master than other forms of billiards like pool once you get the hang of it however snooker plays much like other beloved billiards games and is a fun way to challenge your sense of spatial awareness and control,score more points than your opponent to win in order to secure victory in a game of snooker you have to end the game with a greater number of points than the other player this means that you should try to secure as many points per turn as you can snooker can be tricky to get the hang of at first but with time you ll learn how to place your shots to run the table and make the best of each turn 1 x research source there are 22 balls total used in a game of snooker 15 red 6 multicolored yellow brown green blue pink and black and a single white cue ball which is used to pocket shots the point value of each ball is as follows all red balls 1 yellow 2 green 3 brown 4 blue 5 pink 6 and black 7 players score points every time they successfully sink a ball by the end of the game every ball must be in a pocket for there to be a winner because of the player s ability to pocket colored balls repeatedly during the opening stage of the game a winning score will rarely be below 50 set up the table properly before you can begin playing the balls must be arranged in the right configuration each of the colored balls has a specific location on the table the 15 red balls are arranged in a triangular formation at one end of the table with the pink ball directly in front of the point of the triangle and black ball a few inches behind the red balls the blue ball rests in the center the yellow brown and green balls are lined up horizontally on the breaking end of the table whichever player begins the game will break from the end of the table opposite the cluster of red balls decide which player will break flip a coin or come to an agreement on who will shoot first this player will be responsible for breaking the formation of balls for their opening shot the player will position the white cue ball behind the line of yellow brown and green balls they will then aim to gently dislodge a red ball from the cluster officially starting the game 2 x research source unlike in pool where the object of the break is to scatter the balls across the table a snooker break should be conservative that way your opponent won t have the advantage of multiple shots should you miss 3 x research source the cue ball can be placed anywhere within the d shaped semicircular section of the table alternate between red and colored balls to earn points points are scored by sinking the right balls in the right order the active player will attempt to pocket a red ball first once sunk red balls remain where they are the player will then aim for any of the colored balls which are returned to their designated spot on the table after they ve been pocketed continue the game in this manner going back and forth between red and colored balls until all of the red balls have found their way into a pocket 4 x research source a player s turn is over if they miss a shot 5 x research source if a player scratches pockets the cue ball by mistake or fails to hit a single colored ball or shoots a ball in the wrong order for instance two colored balls in a row it s considered a foul typically they lose their turn and in competition there may also be a point deduction pocket the rest of the colored balls in the correct order after all of the red balls have been pocketed a player can close out the game by consecutively sinking the remaining colored balls in order of their point value in this stage of the game the balls no longer go back to their original position if one player misses it becomes the other player s turn the game is over when there are no more balls on the table 6 x research source following the red balls the colored balls must be deposited in this order yellow green brown blue pink black since missed colored balls stay on the table in the final stages of the game it becomes a free for all to see which player can snag the most points take a comfortable grip grab the cue near the bottom of the thick weighted end the closer to the end you grip the more control and extension your shots will have make sure your hand placement is comfortable and secure to prevent the cue from drifting when you re aiming snooker cues tend to be somewhat heavier and have narrower tips than the cues used in other forms of billiards with a slender tip the player can manipulate the cue ball more precisely how high or low you choose to place your hand on the cue is mostly a matter of personal preference bridge the cue with your non dominant hand lay your non shooting on the table and use it to guide the cue as you shoot most people prefer to use either an open bridge lining up the cue across the groove of the thumb joint or a closed bridge enclosing the end of the cue between their thumb and pointer finger bridging helps you steady the cue as you strike the cue ball allowing you to place your shots with more precision use a solid bridge to keep your cue from wiggling around during your stroke 7 x research source elevating your bridge by lifting the bottom of your hand off the table can enable you to pocket balls that are too close to the rails or other balls move the cue in a smooth straight line to shoot in one tight controlled motion draw your shooting arm back a few inches and thrust it forward hitting the cue ball in the upper part of its center keep your elbow relaxed and close to your side try to make your movements as fluid as possible a jerky or halted stroke will most likely be inaccurate 8 x research source practice shooting straighter by bouncing the cue ball off one of the rails and seeing how closely it returns to the tip of your cue use a precise stroke to place the balls into pockets sink balls by shooting them straight for the pockets or striking one side of the ball so that it rolls in at an angle you can also use the rails or the edges of the tables to bounce balls into pockets on the same side of the table you re shooting from the balls will be in many different positions throughout the game take some time to line up your shots every time it s your turn at the table 9 x research source keep your eye on the ball as you line up your shot and don t let your shoulders come up until you ve completed your stroke calculate the angle you need to strike the ball in order to knock it into a given pocket by aiming for the point on the ball that s directly opposite the pocket s opening use extensions to assist with difficult shots because of the size of a snooker table and the number of balls cluttering the table there may be times when it s impossible to make a successful shot using the standard technique in the situations an extension tool such as a rest also known as a bridge not to be confused with the hand position used while aiming or spider will come in handy rests resemble normal pool cues with the exception of an arched stand at the end the player s cue can be fitted into this stand which takes the place of the bridging hand for steadying shots 10 x research source a rest is a valuable aid for making shots that would otherwise require you to lean across the table the spider extension has a higher arch and should be used in situations where the cue ball is too close to a ball or group of balls to give you a clear shot calculate the value of each shot red balls are worth 1 point each the remaining colored balls are worth an increasing number of points in sequence remember these balls can be pocketed multiple times before the end of the game which will help you quickly drive up your score the fixed position of the colored balls means you should always have a clear shot at one no matter where the cue ball is on the table 11 x research source players should either keep score mentally or have a pen and paper nearby to record the number of points earned after each turn 12 x research source if the losing player s score is so much lower that it s impossible for them to close the gap by the time all the red balls have been cleared from the table it s customary for them to forfeit to the winning player plan your shots strategically as you assess the table make it your goal to sink a red ball that will leave you with a follow up shot at one of the colored balls keep in mind the value of each ball and go for the ball that will earn you the highest number of points whenever you can use an appropriate amount of power for each shot so that the cue ball comes to a stop as near as possible to the center of the table this way you ll always have an unobstructed path 13 x research source the ability to use one shot to set up the next is the hallmark of a skilled snooker player play it safe in general it s best not to take unnecessary risks by staying composed and opting for modest well executed shots you can keep your turn going longer putting you in control of the table look over the entire table and determine what your best option is before trying to pocket a ball at a distance or angle you re not sure you can make 14 x research source the closest shot will usually be the easiest avoid sharp angles or bank shots that require you to use the rails the small size of the pockets makes it more likely that you ll miss take your time snooker tables are quite a bit larger than standard billiard tables and to make it even more complicated the pockets are slightly more narrow for this reason you should always pace yourself when picking lining up and taking your shots being hasty or getting overly excited about scoring could cost you the shot and if you re playing against an experienced opponent one missed shot could mean the end of the game regulation snooker tables measure 12 3 6m long by 6 1 8m wide whereas most pool tables are only 8 2 4m long by 4 1 2m wide additionally the pockets on a snooker table are about 1 5 roughly 3 7cm inches smaller

how to install pool cue tips,when the tip of a pool cue becomes thin and worn down you can replace and install the tip yourself to improve and maintain your billiards play a pool cue tip can be installed using a few common household items,use a razor blade sharp knife or pliers to either cut or pull off the old tip from the end of the cue 1 x research source the cue tip is made entirely from leather and is located at the end of your pool cue on top of the ferrule which is the metal ring or cap located just under the tip scrape off any remaining old glue from the ferrule using your blade or knife use 60 to 80 grit sandpaper to sand down and smooth the end of the pool cue to make the surface as even as possible 2 x research source apply a small amount of nail polish remover to a paper towel nail polish remover contains acetone which is a solvent that will help remove and dissolve any remaining glue and leftover residue from the old tip wipe any remaining residue from the cue tip and bottom shaft areas using the paper towel to prepare for the installation of a new pool cue tip place the new tip flat side down on a piece of 400 to 600 fine grit sandpaper 3 x research source use slight but even pressure to sand the tip using the sandpaper until the tip is smooth on the back side place the tip on the end of the cue to verify that the tip lies flat across the top of the ferrule 4 x research source apply a few drops of glue to the top of the pool shaft the glue should be able to completely cover the tip at the time the cue tip is applied 5 x research source place the cue tip flat side down on the shaft and make adjustments as necessary so that the tip lines up in the center use a paper towel to wipe away any glue residue that escapes from the sides of the cue tip and shaft allow the shaft to sit for at least one hour or until the glue dries use the fine grit sandpaper to gently sand the edges of the tip to make it smooth for billiards play 6 x research source use sandpaper or a tip shaper tool to shape the cue as desired your pool cue will now be ready for use 7 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to pot the ball in snooker,winning snooker doesn t require a ton of natural talent while some have the magic most of us have to rely on practice and a little know how with a basic understanding of the rules and tips on how to shoot you ll be potting the ball and beating your friends at the pub in no time,learn the basic rules though the game is played in casual settings like bars it has quite a few rules if you aren t familiar with them don t be afraid to ask a friend who is you can also consult billiards a governing authority of snooker games 1 x research source if asking a friend try to have them demonstrate the rule and how it is applied rather than just verbally explaining it seeing what a scratch is for instance is much more helpful than simply being told the rule evaluate the whole table take your time choosing your target ball many players attempt difficult shots because they don t see a simpler one the easiest shots are shots where the target ball is close to a hole and your cue ball has a clear path to the target ball walking around the snooker table will help you get a better perspective and make sure you aren t missing any easy balls be sure to use your dominant eye when trying to line up potential shots 2 x research source when looking down the shaft of your cue stick with your dominant eye you should be able to see a clear path through the cue ball and to the target ball pick your target and aim a completely straight shot in which the cup target ball and cue ball are all lined up is easy to aim for to aim for indirect angles imagine a straight line going from the cup and through your target ball aim your cue ball for the spot on the opposite side of the cup that the line goes through the target ball striking the target ball at that angle will direct it to the cup visualize potting the ball after you have found your target visualize the entire process before attempting it imagine your cue striking the cue ball the cue ball striking the target ball and the target ball falling into the cup allowing your mind to see success first will help your body follow through 3 x research source find your stance position yourself behind the cue ball if you are a right handed player your right foot should be behind you directly opposite where the cue stick is aiming at the cue ball your left foot will be in front of you and at a comfortable angle that helps you to maintain balance position your aiming hand your front hand will create a bridge and provide your cue stick with balance as you drive through the shot there are multiple ways to form a bridge and you will want to experiment until you find the one that works for you the open bridge or v bridge rest the cue stick in the v formed by the bottom of your thumb and the top of your index finger the closed bridge involves letting the cue rest on your middle finger and wrapping your index finger around it to form a closed loop that the cue slides through relax your shooting hand it is important to have a firm but relaxed grip after you are leaning against the table and your aiming hand is 6 8 inches away from the cue ball the forearm of your shooting hand should be at about a 90 degree angle from your cue 4 x research source the cue stick will be positioned parallel to the direction of your back foot commit to the shot now that you are positioned you are ready to make the shot be sure to firmly drive the cue through the shot as opposed to simply tapping the cue ball with your cue remember that your cue can t rest on the snooker table as you re shooting you can practice lining up your shot and starting your shooting motion if you d like just like a golfer lining up his putt if you do practice the shooting motion be sure not to touch the cue ball hold your position and follow through it is important to hold your position and keep your balance in the seconds after the shot failing to follow through will make it difficult for your body to remember the motion if you succeed and correct the motion if you fail keep your feet firmly planted until the target ball is in the snooker hole 5 x research source being unable to keep your balance will point out a flaw in your stance or shot if you aren t able to keep your balance reevaluate your stance and shooting motion don t get discouraged snooker is only mastered with practice and patience 6 x research source you may not make your shot the first few times or the first few dozen times keep honing your skills having someone there who can point out what you do wrong will speed the learning process,Sports-and-Fitness
how to break a rack in pool,being asked to break the rack is a privilege since it often sets the tone for the game you may be interested in how to do it with grace and skill although a forceful break is exciting to watch you don t need to set off fireworks with your break shot focus on your posture relax your cue hand and use your hips to move your body forward into a successful break shot,rack the balls gather the balls and put them in the rack align the base of the rack so it is parallel to the back of the pool table put the eight ball in the center of the rack put a solid ball in one corner and a striped ball in the other corner then press the balls together tightly so that all of the balls are in contact with one another 1 x research source place the cue ball on or behind the head string you can put the cue ball anywhere on or behind the head string which is the quarter of the pool table furthest away from the rack 2 x research source it is best not to put the ball right in the middle of the head string directly opposite the head ball in the rack since the pool table will be more worn down in this area and you may not get as good a shot instead place the ball a little bit off to one side or the other which will also make it easier to aim 3 x research source stand behind the cue ball with your feet spread apart you should be leaning forward from the waist and your knees should be slightly bent you should be holding the pool cue with both hands and the cue should be directed towards the cue ball find a hip width that feels right for you 4 x research source a wider stance will give you more stability a narrower stance will allow for more momentum as you move your hips forward through the shot you ll be slightly more upright than for a regular shot place your hand on the table in a closed bridge put your hand on the table and then lay the pool cue across the middle of your thumb and index finger curl your index finger around the cue then touch your index finger with your thumb so that you have a circle around the shaft spread your fingers for greater stability your bridge hand should be loose and relaxed to ensure accuracy 5 x research source since your torso will move up when you hit the ball a closed bridge will prevent your tip from rising up and help ensure greater accuracy 6 x research source set the distance between your bridge hand and the ball some people prefer a slightly longer bridge distance on their break shot for instance some people set up their bridge hand eight or ten inches from the ball which allows for greater force however if your bridge distance is too great you may compromise your accuracy you ll have to experiment until you find a distance that works well for you such as six or eight inches 7 x research source beginners often rest their stick on the back rail on a regulation table that puts you too far away move your back hand into position behind your shoulder with your back hand hold the back of the pool cue with a firm grip close your fingers around the pool cue bring it into position which is behind your shoulder and just above your hip 8 x research source some people prefer a longer backswing which allows for greater force in the break shot some people prefer to choke up slightly on the backswing which can ensure greater accuracy aim straight at the head ball you want to hit the center of the head ball which is the ball at the top of the rack by hitting the center of the head ball you will efficiently transfer force towards the rest of the rack and properly distribute the balls 9 x research source some players aim for the second row of balls in order to bounce the cue ball off a rail and back into the rack for more action line up your cue with the cue ball you ll want to hit the cue ball ½ 13 millimetres below the center which is the size of the tip of your pool cue by hitting it just below the center you can make the cue ball stop in the middle of the table after the break with the cue ball in the middle of the table you ll be in a much better position for your next shot 10 x research source focus your attention on the ball start by glancing back and forth between the cue ball and the head ball once you feel comfortable with the shot direct your focus to either the head ball or the cue ball keep your eyes on the ball before shooting 11 x research source study the object paths in a break you can make subtle adjustments to your aim based on the object paths involved in your break if you are playing eight ball you might be able to sink the two balls behind the head ball into the side pockets however if you are playing nine ball you could possibly get the wing balls in the back pockets make adjustments to your aim until you are able to sink some of these balls more reliably with your break 12 x research source pull your cue back slowly with your back hand bring your back hand behind your shoulder and just above your hips if you want more of a back swing you can bring it back a little further steady your bridge hand relax and get ready to shoot 13 x research source you want a smooth controlled backswing with full follow through a steady square impact carries more force than a lightning fast shank make direct contact with the head ball to break the rack effectively hit the head ball directly on target you ll also need to apply sufficient force to distribute the balls around the table however it is best to relax and focus on a square hit as opposed to trying to apply excessive force the main thing is to hit the head ball squarely 14 x research source the force in the break shot comes from the legs and hips move your hips forward to achieve greater force shoot the cue ball hit the cue ball with the cue stick move your body forward from the hips to apply more power in your break shot let your torso move up at the end of the stroke your cue stick should be pointing towards the back of the table when you finish 15 x research source fine tune your break shot by watching where the balls land take a moment after each shot to note the position of the cue ball and the formation on the table if the cue ball tends to drive forward after impact hit it lower for more backspin if it likes to veer off toward the sides hit it slower for greater accuracy and power 16 x research source if you are close to sinking the two balls behind the cue ball think about how you could fine tune your shot to sink them in the corner pockets,Sports-and-Fitness
how to bank in pool,in billiards games the term bank refers to bouncing a ball off the rails of the table in order to make a shot this can be done with either the cue ball or the object ball which greatly increases your possible shot selection a solid bank shot relies on two things the path of the ball and the force of the stroke once you have an understanding of how to place a rebounding ball right where you want it nothing will stop you from running the table,locate the diamonds on the table on any regulation pool table you ll notice a series of light colored dots running down the length of the rails these are known as diamonds and they re an integral part of establishing precise angles no matter where on the table you re playing from you can use the diamonds to sink bank shots with accuracy and consistency 1 x research source the basic idea behind the diamonds is they help create mirrored angles if you shoot the object ball into a diamond at a 45 degree angle it should bounce off the rail at 45 degrees in the opposite direction 2 x research source lining up your shot with the diamonds will only work if you re able to shoot straight and smooth so be sure to practice your stroke to ensure success 3 x research source number the diamonds along each rail beginning with the foot rail count each diamond up from 1 starting at the corner pocket which is the imaginary first diamond do the same for the longer side rail you should end up with two separate ranges of numbers typically 1 5 and 1 9 4 x research source the exact number of diamonds on the rails may differ depending on the size of the table a 9 regulation pool table will have 5 diamonds on the foot rails and 9 on the sides it s not important for a table to have a certain number of diamonds what is important is knowing how to use the diamonds that are there to determine your most promising shooting angle assign a number position for the cue and object balls take note of where each ball is in relation to the diamonds you just numbered for instance if the cue ball is sitting in front of the corner pocket it would be at diamond 1 an object ball just short of the far side pocket would be at diamond 4 balls resting between diamonds can be assigned an intermediate number such as 3 5 assuming you re attempting a bank shot from one end of the table to the other use the foot rail diamonds to determine the position of the balls in play split the difference to target the right diamond in the example just described the position of the object ball diamond 4 minus the position of the cue ball diamond 1 equals 3 diamonds length divide this number in half to find the halfway point between the two balls 1 5 diamonds length away 5 x research source you ll need to aim for the imaginary diamond at the halfway point diamond 2 5 in order to achieve a perfect mirrored angle and pocket the object ball once you ve discovered the correct angle all you have to do is bank the object ball straight into the diamond and let physics take care of the rest add and divide the ball positions for precise kick shots first find the numbered positions of the cue and object balls and add them together using the example positions this gives you 5 then divide this number in half to get 2 5 this will tell you exactly where to hit the cue ball in order to get the object ball moving in the right direction 6 x research source a kick shot also known as a lag shot is when you bank the cue ball before it strikes the object ball this type of shot is useful when there are other balls in the way of a more direct shot 7 x research source kick shots can be tricky because if your margin of error is even a little bit off the cue ball will strike the object ball at the wrong angle throwing off your shot pay attention to the placement of the cue and object balls it s important to observe where the balls are in relation to one another in order to select the right pockets for reference plan out your shot ahead of time by selecting a target pocket that you want to sink the object ball in generally speaking the best target pocket is the one that s closest with the least amount of obstructions when sighting your shot use the diamond that s an equal distance between the cue ball and the target pocket draw a line from the mouth of the target pocket imagine that the line extends from the opening of the pocket straight to the opposite rail this is what s known as the cross pocket line make a mental snapshot of this line and hold it in your mind 8 x research source the cross pocket line is the one you ordinarily use to line up straight shots if you need help visualizing the line try laying your cue across the table at the appropriate angle draw a second line from the object ball to the opposite pocket this line also called the ball pocket line will run from the center of the object ball to the pocket mirroring the one you re targeting if you re shooting for a corner pocket for example the ball pocket line should be drawn at the other corner pocket on the same end of the table 9 x research source by using opposing pockets to draw your lines you re effectively sectioning off the table to create a central focal point aim for the spot on the rail where the lines intersect the cross pocket and ball pocket lines will form an x draw one more short line from the middle of the x directly to the opposite rail this is the bank point line and it indicates where you should aim to set up a proper mirror angle and sink a difficult bank shot after you ve found the bank point line you can set up your shot the way you normally would only with a definite visual guide in mind use the diamonds to keep track of the position of the blank point line picturing cross pocket lines is a quicker simpler way to calculate angles during competitive play than counting diamonds apply english as needed whether you re using the diamonds or cross pocket lines there will always be some degree of inaccuracy by striking the cue or object ball forcefully at either edge you can generate a little english or lateral ball spin english is useful for helping overcome imprecise angles and making sure that the ball enters the pocket from just the right direction 10 x research source english refers to the left or right rotation of a ball and is not be confused with topspin 11 x research source a good example of when english might be necessary is when you have the angle of your shot zeroed in but striking the ball directly would cause it to deflect off the rails hit the cue ball with an appropriate amount of force striking a ball with medium to high force causes it to skid rather than roll which results in a truer banking angle it also eliminates other factors that can interfere with your shot like friction and drag from the felt a gentler stroke on the other hand will give you more control over cue ball spin and english which can come in handy for delicate shots 12 x research source the power you put into your stroke will usually be determined by the distance between the cue and object balls and between the balls and the rails 13 x research source try kick shots when other shots are blocked sometimes you won t have a clear path to a straight or banked shot in these situations banking the cue ball off the rails allows you to bypass obstacles and sink a ball in the process it will then be a cinch to pull off shots that wouldn t otherwise be possible 14 x research source kick shots are also a good way to avoid fouls since they don t require you to risk contacting the other player s balls unless you excel at kick shots it s typically safest to use them as a last resort practice when it comes to getting a feel for the table there s no substitute for simply playing more even if a shot makes sense to you on theoretical level you might have to attempt it dozens of times before you get the hang of it this is especially true of bank shots which force you to analyze the table and showcase impeccable technique 15 x research source make use of drills designed to refine your ability to size up bank shots on the fly 16 x research source start challenging

how to curve a pool ball,a curved pool ball shot also called a massé shot is useful for curving the cue ball around a ball that s in the way to curve your ball effectively elevate the cue stick and strike the ball below its center if you want the ball to curve to the left hit it on its left side while hitting a ball on its right side will curve it to the right by spending time practicing you ll be showing off your curve shot in no time,use the curved shot to curve the ball around another ball that s in the way if you re trying to hit a ball into a pocket and another ball is blocking its direct path this is the perfect time to curve your cue ball when your cue ball has a little curve in it it ll go around the ball that s in the way and hopefully hit the correct one 1 x research source apply chalk to the cue stick to create necessary friction gently rub chalk on your cue stick making sure the tip has a fine layer the chalk will make sure your cue stick doesn t slip off the side of the cue ball before you ve had a chance to make your shot 2 x research source if your piece of chalk has a deep groove in it from previous cue sticks check after you ve applied the chalk to make sure the chalk actually reached the tip and not just the edges of the stick elevate the cue stick to at least a 30 degree angle because this shot uses a downward strike you ll need to hold the cue stick at much more of an angle than usual try holding the cue stick at a 30 35 or 40 degree angle to curve the ball most effectively 3 x research source the exact angle that s needed will depend on the placement of the balls from each other and around the table so play around with the angles until you find a method that works for you if your cue stick isn t elevated you won t be able to hit the bottom portion of the cue ball as efficiently rest the tip of the cue stick between your fingers for a steady aim when you re holding the cue stick getting ready to strike the ball give yourself more control of your shot by positioning the tip of the cue in between your thumb and pointer finger creating a v your fingers should be touching the pool table to give you more stability 4 x research source hold the cue stick with a loose grip instead of a tight one to give you more accuracy and power in your shot there are several other ways to position the tip of the cue stick between your fingers to take aim so find one that suits your style hit the cue ball on the side you d like it to curve if you want your cue ball to curve around a ball and to the right hit the cue ball s right side to make the cue ball curve to the left hit its left side whichever side of the cue ball that you strike is the direction it will curve 5 x research source control the curve by hitting on or below the cue ball s central axis the central axis is an imaginary line running around the center of the ball if you hit the ball above this line your ball is more likely to go in a straight line instead of a curve 6 x research source test out different curves by changing how far up or down on the ball you hit it staying below the central axis strike downward to ensure you hit the bottom of the ball since you re holding the cue stick at an elevated angle it ll be easier to make a downward movement avoid trying to level out the cue stick as you re aiming instead bring it down onto the ball in a straight line 7 x research source use enough force so the cue ball curves around the ball in the way while you shouldn t strike the ball so hard that it damages the table or makes the ball pop up you will need to use more force than you would for a regular shot practice putting a little bit more impact into your shots for the best results 8 x research source if you don t use enough force the ball may curve around the ball that s in the way but it might not have enough speed to hit the ball you re aiming for spend time practicing to get better at the shot curving a pool ball might not come naturally the first couple times you do it keep practicing remembering to elevate your cue stick and hitting the left or right side of the ball depending on which direction you want it to curve by spending time working on the shot you ll learn how to do it well 9 x research source set up practice scenarios by putting one ball near a pocket the cue ball set farther back and the ball that s in the way placed in the middle of the other two balls,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play cut throat in billiards,cutthroat also known as three man elimination is which consists of three people or three teams with an even amount of people the object of the game is to legally pocket all of your opponent s group of pool balls before your opponent legally pockets your group of pool balls although general game rules exist there are many regional variations,know which balls are used in cutthroat billiards the standard set of numbered 1 15 balls plus a cue ball are used to play the game the numbered balls are split into three sets and each set will belong to each of the three players the first set has balls 1 5 the second set has balls 6 10 and the third set has balls 11 15 the object of cutthroat billiards is to pocket all of your opponent s balls and be the only player with balls from your group remaining on the table 1 x research source determine who will break the shooting order is determined by lagging one at a time each player should take turns shooting the cue ball towards the foot cushion of the table the balls will bounce back toward the head end of the table whichever player s ball ends up closest to the head end of the table has won the lag the player who is third in the shooting order will rack the balls while the first shooting player will break them 2 x research source decide whether players will call shots or not calling shots means naming the ball and the pocket you intend to shoot the ball in in games where you have decided to call shots you must name the ball and pocket accurately for each shot or it will not count learn the fouls of the game a legal shot requires that the cue ball is used to contact the numbered balls on all shots players must cause the cue ball to contact an object ball any legally pocketed ball allows the shooter to continue at the table until they fail to pocket a numbered ball other fouls including scratching hitting the balls of the table and pocketing your own balls if player pockets their opponents ball on an illegal shot the shot doesn t count if the player pockets his own ball on an illegal shot the ball remains pocketed and their turn ends numbered balls that are hit off the table are considered foul and the penalty for fouls is followed the next player accepts the cue ball in the current position if the cue ball is scratched or jumped off the table the incoming player gets the cue ball and can place it anywhere behind the head string know the penalties of a foul whenever a player commits a foul their turn ends one ball from each of the opponents groups of balls that has been pocketed is brought back into play this allows players who were eliminated to be brought back into the game at any time until the game is over if a player s group has no pocketed balls at the time of a foul then the penalty has no effect on that group or player obtain the proper equipment cutthroat is played on a standard pool table with a cue ball along with a standard set of pool balls 1 15 a standard triangle a cue pool stick for each player participating players may share cues as well a cue bridge for those hard to reach shots and a cue chalk for chalking the tips of the cues 3 x research source set up the rack a standard triangle rack is used in cutthroat billiards the three corners of the rack should be filled with one ball from each group specifically the 1 ball should be in the front corner and the 6 and 11 balls should be placed on the two corners the rest of the balls don t have specific spots but should be spread out amongst the triangle rack this will ensure the best possible break 4 x research source break to begin the game as previously mentioned you should have determined which player will be breaking by performing a lag if the starting player fails to make a legal break the next player can accept the table s position and shoot or can ask for a re rack and new break of the balls any balls pocketed on a legal break remain pocketed an illegal break includes failing to break the rack of balls correctly or shooting the cue ball off of the table 5 x research source determine which set of balls is yours players take turns trying to pocket balls until they get a ball in a pocket if the first shooter s break is successful they will get the first shot to claim a set of balls numbers 1 5 6 10 or 11 15 the next player to shoot a ball in the pocket gets their choice of the remaining two sets of balls and the third player gets whichever set is left the objective is to shoot your opponents balls into the pockets so choose the sets that have the most balls left on the table unfortunately the third shooter won t have much of a choice 6 x research source start the game after a successful break each player will shoot their turn a turn is over once a player makes no shot or makes an illegal move illegal moves include scratches shooting the cue ball in a pocket moving a ball with your hands or your cue and shooting the cue ball off the pool table 7 x research source declare a winner a winner is declared when they are the only player with balls left on the table when a player has no balls on the table they are considered out and their turn is skipped in the rotation of taking shots when the game is over the winner becomes the breaker the second to last player standing becomes the second player of the next game and the player who lost first racks for the next game this results in a shuffling of which player gets which set of balls from one game to the next 8 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to break in 9 ball,the opening break shot in 9 ball pool may be the most important part of the game with the right technique you have a good chance to pocket at least one ball before your opponent has even played or stymie your opponent s chances at a good start use these tips to learn the official break rules to practice improving your power and control and finally to learn and experiment with different styles of break shot to improve your game,determine who breaks first by lagging each player sets a ball on the table behind the head string meaning between the end of the table and the second pair of diamonds or marks on the table s sides at about the same time each player hits one of the balls aiming to touch the far end of the table and return as close to the near end as possible without touching the near end or the sides whoever comes closest gets to break repeat the lag if both players hit the sides or nearest end if you are playing multiple rounds you only need to lag before the first one after that players take turns breaking set up the rack set up the nine object balls everything besides the un numbered cue ball in a tightly packed diamond shape the ball at one end of the diamond is on top of the marked foot spot on the table surface the nine ball is in the center of the diamond and the other balls are arranged randomly around it break by shooting the cue ball at the rack the player about to break places the cue ball behind the head string on the far side of the table from the diamond shaped rack of balls remember the head string runs between the second pair of diamonds marked on the table s sides that player then shoots the cue ball at the one ball at the diamond s closest tip in official rules the break must either cause one numbered ball to enter a pocket or cause at least four balls to hit a side of the table if neither of these happen the break is considered a foul and the other player may place the cue ball anywhere on the table you may wish to play without break fouls if you are playing casually decide whether to push out immediately after a player breaks that same player can declare that he will push if he does he takes an additional shot with the intention of putting the ball in position unlike with a normal shot this shot does not require any balls to hit a cushion or be pocketed the push out is always optional if the player does not say he will push the shot is considered a normal shot and ordinary foul rules apply begin normal play if the breaker pocketed a ball on the break not the push out that player continues shooting until he fails to pocket a ball or commits a foul otherwise the player who did not break has the first chance to play however if that player thinks the cue ball is in a position that isn t advantageous she may pass and have the player who broke make the first shot instead the player who broke must take the first shot if his opponent passes he cannot pass back keep some space between the cue ball and the near cushion if the cue ball is placed too near the cushion your pool cue will be at a steep awkward angle making it difficult to hit with speed and control place the cue ball far enough from the cushion to allow for your normal range of motion when using a cue then add an additional 1 2 inches 2 5 5cm of space to allow an even flatter steadier cue note that the cue ball must be placed behind the head string if the head string isn t drawn on the table find it by looking for the diamonds or marks on the table s sides and counting to the second pair of diamonds from the table s end the imaginary line between this pair of diamonds is the head string when you first begin practicing place the cue ball directly in line with the rack the more in line the cue ball is with the rack the easier the shot will be as you get better at breaking you can try more advanced breaking techniques described below but while you re a beginner stick with the center placement hit the cue ball in its center for the basic break shot aim for the center of the cue ball not above or below it 1 x research source if you notice your cue ball has backspin or forward spin try watching the tip of your pool cue as you shoot to look for unintentional movements practice an even motion while shooting keeping your elbow level to avoid shifting the pool cue up or down practice your balance and positioning for a powerful break shot you ll need to stay balanced as you hit the cue ball then follow through by moving forward many players stand slightly to the side of the ball to allow the cue a full range of motion and may bend at the knees before they strike encouraging a fluid follow through use an exaggerated follow through following through or continuing to move the cue forward after striking the ball is an excellent way to practice and evaluate your break shots 2 x research source accelerate the cue through the ball so you continue to move in one fluid motion rather than stopping or moving jerkily after the ball is struck keep your eyes down near the cue and watch the cue ball as you follow through if the cue does not move in line with the cue ball practice shooting steadily and accurately until it does before you concentrate on strength aim for the center of the one ball the most common place to aim and the easiest is the one ball at the nearest point on the rack if the cue ball is not in line with the diamond try not to let the diamond shape confuse your aim focus on the single ball you are aiming for and try to hit the exact center of that ball choose control over power it s better to hit the cue ball softly and aim correctly rather than break hard and fast but lose control of your cue ball 3 x research source if your cue ball often misses or scratches meaning it ends up fouled by falling in a pocket try to shoot more gently practice stronger power breaks once you are able to consistently hit the center of the ball you are aiming for place the cue ball near one of the side cushions once you ve achieved consistent accuracy and power shooting from the center try placing the cue ball nearer one fo the side cushions give yourself about 2 3 inches 5 7 5 cm of space or however much room you need to shoot comfortably most professional players start near this area when breaking in tournaments some tournaments may require you to begin within a certain area closer to the center due to the dominance of this technique practice getting the one ball into the side pocket professional players manage to pocket a ball on the break a majority of the time 4 x research source one way to accomplish this is to strike the one ball at the nearest tip of the diamond and get it to rebound off the rest of the diamond and into the side pocket try starting from near the left cushion and aiming to put the one ball in the right side pocket or vice versa some players do not like this technique since it can be hard to control the two and three balls which you ll need to hit next consider it good practice for pocketing a ball on the break and decide whether to continue using it once you are more experienced practice getting one of the side balls into the corner pockets the two balls on the shorter tips of the diamond or wing balls can sometimes be hit into the corner pockets although don t expect to get both at once this technique will likely require a fair amount of practice begin by placing the cue ball near the left side cushion and aim at the center of the one ball watch the wing ball near the left cushion and see where it ends up if it drifts toward the end cushion set up the rack again and aim slightly more to the right if the wing ball hits the left side cushion instead aim to the left next time once you ve found a spot that consistently gets the wing ball near or in the corner pocket practice the shot repeatedly to make it more consistent think about where the cue ball and one ball will end up once you can consistently hit the spot you are aiming for and rarely scratch or foul on the break start thinking about positioning after the break with enough control and potentially by adding spin to the cue ball you can get the cue ball to end up near the center line of the table giving yourself a better chance at a good second shot if you manage to pocket a ball on the break if you are not trying to get the one ball in watch where it ends up as well since it is the next ball you will have to pocket ideally the one ball ends up near the center of the table in line with the cue ball find a new table s sweet spot each table has slightly different characteristics and if you move to a new one you might find your breaks are not as effective move the cue ball around until you find a location that gets good results for your preferred strength and style of break try to find a worn out spot on the table s surface where many players have placed a cue ball before this is not ideal as you may have a different break style than those players but it s worth a try if you don t have more time to spend exploring different positions,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play pool in a bar or tavern,playing pool in a bar or pub is very fun not only do you have access to potentially great competitors but you re in a warm and inviting environment you also have a relatively captive audience who on occasion might buy you drinks if you win however there are a few challenges when it comes to bar or pub pool the rules of the game might sometimes be less clear than you think rules might vary based on your region and very few people follow the rules to the letter of tournament pool but ultimately there are some basics that are respected in virtually all places where people play pool in a bar or pub,learn basic pool rules as most people will follow them unless people state otherwise they ll follow basic pool rules you should know these basic pool rules before you play in a bar or pub or anywhere else for that matter they are call your shot the shot after the break is the one that determines color ownership even if a ball went in during the break for a shot to count you ve got to hit your color first if you hit another player s ball the shot doesn t count if you hit the 8 ball it s an illegal shot unless it s the final 8 ball shot 1 x research source expect that there might be some rule variation based on where you are different regions and countries often have rule variations it is good practice to be aware of regional rule variations before you even agree to play a game that way nothing will be a surprise to you talk to people in the bar about the rules before you volunteer lookup local rules on the internet before you go to a bar see if there are any rules posted in the bar or pub that you re interested in playing in 2 x research source figure that some of the official tournament rules do not typically apply to bar pool bar pool is how many good players typically play this is important as bar pool is a relatively casual way of playing pool that is also taken seriously by the players 3 x research source don t go into a bar or pub thinking you re going to play to the letter of official tournament rules most people who play pool in bars play by relatively standard rules but there is also a wide variation of how rules are interpreted or followed talk to whoever it is your playing against to understand what sort of rules they expect the game to follow take ownership of the table if you win often times the person who won the last game essentially owns the table this means a number of things that you should understand and respect before playing with that person the winner will play in the next game the winner will often go first or decide if they re going first or not in the next game the winner can declare special or custom rules for the next game 4 x research source ask to see if there is an order of play most times in a bar there will be a lot of people waiting to play make sure you don t step in ahead of someone stepping in ahead of someone will not only be considered rude but it could get you into a fight ask whoever s playing if anyone is next look for a chalkboard to see if there is a list of people waiting to play be polite and patient if there are other people waiting to play 5 x research source agree upon additional rules before you begin any house rules or local rules should be stated and agreed upon before the game begins if there are any house rules you ll probably be notified of those rules relatively quickly when you jump in to play approach the person who owns the table and ask hey i d love to play are there any custom rules i should know about if they say yeah make sure you understand all of the rules if you don t understand ask them to explain the rule write them down if you don t think you ll remember the rules rack the balls in accordance to rules and customs in most bars balls often do not have to be racked the way they are in tournaments many people will just randomly rack the balls however there are a number of things you do need to do when racking balls in a bar or pub don t worry about any particular order or color based racking the only requirement is that the 8 ball be the front most of the center three balls most people put the 1 in front it is also good to place a stripe in one of the rear corners 6 x research source call your exact shot if required by local rules call your exact shot including which balls are touched by the target ball on the way to the pocket this is a very important element of the game and if you can call your shot you should however many players in bar are forgiving and shot calling might be optional if it is not optional remember if you make the ball but not exactly how you called it you lose the rest of your turn but the ball stays in hey it s a bar table touching a rail on the way to a pocket is incidental and not a foul a badly sunk ball is called slop it is not necessary to call an obvious straight in kind of shot calling your exact shot is very important in a bar or pub being able to call shots is also what separates good players from not so good players 7 x research source select your color after the break after you break the racked balls you can select your color whoever breaks the balls selects their color first the second player is then assigned the other color the table is typically considered open after the break even if a ball was sunk on the break so the shooter can select either color on his second shot if you fail to sink another ball the table is still open until one of the players makes a fair called shot before a ball has been sunk that determines your color on the first shot or two you can legally hit any combination except using the 8 ball hit your color first after your color solids or stripes has been determined you must hit your color first on every shot except for the 8 ball shot an opponent s ball may be in the center of a three ball combination often times if you hit your opponent s color first the shot is considered illegal and you will lose your turn avoid hitting the 8 ball the 8 ball can never be hit first except when trying to sink it of course it cannot be hit first by the cue ball in a combination carom etc in fact the 8 ball should never be used in any manner until it is the target ball on your final shot rules for the use of 8 ball in a legal combination carom shot vary from bar to bar locale to locale most times it is one of the pre game rules agreed upon by the players or in the set rules of play depending on the venue the 8 ball is never neutral take hits in which the 8 ball won t carom or kiss a carom is when the cue ball hits two other balls successively you can only carom or kiss the cue ball off of your color ball after the cue hits your target ball the target ball can carom off of an opponent s ball try not to scratch a scratch is when the cue ball goes into a pocket if you scratch you lose your turn don t scratch because your opponent will get a leg up on you make sure that you do your best to make sure only your color balls go into the pocket place the cue ball behind the head spot after a scratch the cue ball is placed behind the head spot head string across the table diamond to diamond the center of the target ball must be past the head string this rule is standard in most all bars and taverns avoid direct splits direct splits are when you shoot and contact two balls simultaneously with the cue ball they are often illegal direct splits are always questionable when they involve the 8 ball or an opponent s object ball avoid direct splits if you can in official play of any kind it is never legal to hit your target ball after or at the exact instance as an opponent s ball even if you call it first as a split a direct split is also known as a mixed split there is no such thing as a legal mixed split local rules for this mixed split shot vary from bar to bar locale to locale etc most times it is one of the pre game rules agreed upon by the players or in the set rules of play depending on the venue 8 x research source sink your 8 ball without hitting another ball your 8 ball shot should be a clean hit which means you can t hit the other player s ball this is perhaps the most

how to drift on a bicycle,drifting also known as skidding when you re doing it on a bike is a technique where you approach a corner on your bike at a high speed and move around the turn as your back tire loses traction with the ground to successfully skid around a corner you should lean into the turn as you re going around it and shift your body weight forward skidding on a bike takes practice but once you get the hang of it you can use the technique to improve your speed and ride private downhill trails with ease,pedal quickly toward a turn the faster you re going when you get to the turn the easier it will be to get your back tire to skid riding downhill toward a turn can help you pick up speed 1 x research source lean in the direction of the turn once you reach it shift your body weight in the direction you re turning so your body and bike are at about a 45 degree angle from the ground keep leaning as you go around the corner of the turn 2 x research source for example if you re taking a left turn lean your body to the left shift your weight forward as you go around the turn to shift your weight lean slightly forward over your handlebars this will lighten the load on your back tire which will let it skid off the ground as you re going around the turn you should start to feel your back tire skidding outward gently press the rear brake if you need help getting the tire to break loose 3 x research source extend your inside foot out so it s hovering slightly above the ground your inside foot is your foot that s closest to the inside corner of the turn continue to hold your foot out just above the ground as you go around the turn 4 x research source for example if you re taking a right turn your right foot would be your inside foot if you feel like you re skidding out of control or your bike is going to spin out plant your inside foot on the ground to stabilize yourself bring your body and bike upright again once you complete the turn this will help your back tire regain traction after skidding to bring yourself upright on your bike stop leaning into the turn and pull your body weight up 5 x research source practice skidding at slower speeds first skidding is easier when you re going faster but higher speeds can increase your chances of wiping out when you first start out approach turns slowly and work on leaning into the turn and shifting your weight forward once you get the motions down gradually increase your speed going into the turn 6 x research source try skidding in a gravel parking lot before you practice on a trail use cones or another marker to indicate where you should turn in the parking lot then pedal toward that spot and try to get your back tire to skid outward as you go around the turn practicing in a parking lot is safer than practicing on a downhill trail and you won t have to worry about damaging the trail 7 x research source skid around wide round turns when you re starting out thin sharp turns give you less room for error and less time to skid so they re not the best to practice on look for turns that are round and wide so you have more time to work on your form as you go around them 8 x research source be persistent skidding is an advanced biking move and it can take a lot of practice to get it down if you keep spinning out or your back tire isn t skidding outward try adjusting how much you re leaning in and shifting your weight forward you can even ask someone to film you practicing so you can see what your form looks like keep practicing and eventually you ll get there,Sports-and-Fitness

making it to the top of the hill this is something that you re quite capable of doing and proving it to yourself can be a lot of fun in between the agony don t expect to go fast that s unrealistic and likely to wear you out before you ve hardly begun understand the benefits to your body of cycling on hilly terrain hilly terrain builds your fitness levels up by helping your body learn to use oxygen more efficiently also the process of climbing the hill on a bike uses different muscle groups as you shift about on the bike to maintain maximum power the climb allows you to work hard and the descent allows you to recover providing a perfect exercise workout per each hill 1 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 76 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 start the hill climb staying

you in pushing down hard on the pedals standing up takes a lot more energy than sitting down so don t overuse this technique keep it till the last portion of the steep hill your hands should now sit on top of the brake levers shift your body in time with your legs keep your back straight and your chest open to aid good breathing 4 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p

takes practice to get used to how it feels to change gears as a method of changing the pace and power when climbing a hill so don t despair just keep practicing it shift the gears in anticipation of or just before each terrain gradient change not once you ve already reached each gradient keep pedaling while you change gears so as to maintain momentum 5 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 67 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 the aim is to keep your effort as constant as possible a low gear is needed for going uphill you ll need the higher gear for going back down keep practicing this technique won t be easy for the first few tries but it s important to persevere it is only in the doing that you will learn the feel for climbing the hill on the bike and learn the right timing for shifting your body weight on the bike to achieve the maximum power for the least effort start with shorter hills and gradually increase your trials to steeper ones try using low gear with a steep hill once you re feeling more confident with hill climbing on a bicycle learn the technique for climbing a hill economically this technique requires that you stay seated and use a low gear and don t rely on standing up for much of the time 6 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 83 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 breathe regularly and deeply keep it slow and gradual in the early stages of the hill climb this isn t a race it s about economizing your energy usage select the low gear that will still allow for reasonably fast pedaling sit up and hold the outer edges of the handlebars this will ensure that your breathing is made easier by an open chest once the hill gets much harder and you notice you ve no lower gears left to use grip onto the brake hoods pull them to give you more power when pedaling only now use standing briefly if needed at this point you should intuitively know what feels best for you in the combination between standing and sitting in the bike for the most economic use of your energy stay focused on a steady rhythmical climb that makes the most of every turn of the wheels to pull you up this hill this kind of slower but powerful riding takes time to master but it s efficient and is good for longer rides such as when traveling through hilly country for long distances you are far less likely to tire out than using the method that requires standing to get you up the hills in turns take the long way on the outer side of the turn it may seem illogical but you ll lose less momentum that way have a rest at the top of the hill for a particularly strenuous hill climb a brief hilltop rest may be in order especially while training yourself to get used to it descend with care be alert for obstacles like cars pedestrians animals and objects on the road don t go down too quickly use both your brakes to pull back the speed and by sitting upright in your seat so that your body acts like an air brake 7 x

how to commute by bicycle,after an initial investment of purchasing a bicycle you ll realize that biking is a very inexpensive mode of transportation you ll save money on gas and car maintenance you ll get in great shape and your coworkers will think you re awesome why not skip the traffic jam and walk into your workplace with an endorphin rush,find a safe and pleasant route don t just assume that the route you drive to work is the best route for biking often the best bike route includes back streets and side roads which may make your trip slightly longer but much safer and more enjoyable be realistic and honest with yourself are you really comfortable spending 20 minutes a day with the traffic from a freeway feeder whizzing by you at 60 mph 97 km h your local bike shop will probably have bicycle route maps get one and map out your route to work if there are no bike route maps get on your bike on a non work day and scout out the area consider incorporating streets with bicycle lanes when starting out dedicated bicycle lanes are great for beginners although more confident cyclists often consider riding on the road to be both faster and safer taking the lane is when the rider rides down the center of the lane so no car is tempted to squeeze past with questionable spacing be aware of other users on bike paths such as folks with strollers or dogs announce that you are passing on the left when overtaking someone on the bike path a cough or ringing your bell is a minimum if not a pleasant i m on your left do not sneak up behind someone overtaking them without warning them it is more courteous to announce your presence and well in advance you may find that your route to work in the morning is more highly trafficked in the afternoon and that you need different routes to and from work if necessary combine bicycling with public transit more and more transit systems are finding ways to accommodate bicyclists if yours isn t up to speed consider purchasing a folding bike to bring with you on a bus or train or using two bicycles one between home and your stop or station another for between the stop or station and your workplace do a test run of your bike route on a day with light traffic if you don t have a bike yet borrow one and make your test drive before purchasing one it ll give you a better idea of what kind of bike you ll need try some alternate routes if possible make a note of how long each route takes you avoid streets with excessive potholes or junk on the road avoid questionable neighborhoods where your safety might be at risk a public open space is always better than a hidden alleyway determine where you can lock your bike while you are at work ask your manager or supervisor maybe there s a closet or storage area where they ll let you leave your bike for the day otherwise find a street sign that does not pull out of the ground or a post to secure your bike onto with a good lock or more than one to further discourage theft if you lock to a traffic sign remember that it might be possible for a thief to unbolt the sign and then slide your bike up over the top the best thing to lock to is a complete loop of welded metal that is securely anchored into brick or concrete second choice would be a pole with welded cross members wider than the longest dimension of your lock acquire a bike find a local bicycle shop there knowledgeable people can help you decide what to buy see the choosing a commuter bike section below for more advice if you buy a cheap bike at a discount store have it fitted to you so you re comfortable if you buy an investment bicycle you may have a smoother ride but you will always be worried about someone stealing your bike what you buy will be for the same reasons you buy a cheap car purchase the best lock to protect your bike stay away from cables which can be cut one wire at a time quickly too combination locks and locks using a cylindrical key research the local bicycling laws of your area this is essential to remain safe and within the law many places assign bicycles the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle most of the time riding on the sidewalk can not only increase your chances of running into something or someone but it can also earn you a traffic ticket even if stop signs are optional in your area you can never be sure how a car will react if they are at the intersection too register your bike if required learn how to make simple bicycle repairs before you hit the road a flat tire loose brake cable loose seat post or loose handlebar an unbalanced wheel or other minor adjustments may pop up while you re commuting be ready for them prepare and carry a lightweight bicycle specific toolkit include metric allen wrenches that fit your bike s bolts a screwdriver and or a multi use tool designed specifically for bike maintenance a pair of latex disposable gloves can come in very handy because it s hard to get the grease off your hands once you arrive at work a lightweight air pump or co2 cartridge inflation device tire levers and a tube patch kit do not add much weight but on site repairs can be time consuming a spare inner tube is nice but it s only single use without a patch kit a good compromise is to have a spare tube for on the spot repairs and then use the patch kit to repair your tube when you get to work so that you can then use your repaired tube as the spare for the commute home you may even want to invest in flat free tubes or tire liners puncture resistant tires work well if you plan to commute daily especially over gravel or where there may be broken glass they are worth the extra money take safety precautions while riding keep a reasonable distance between your bicycle and parked cars the most common accident for commuting cyclists is running into a suddenly opened car door don t make any sudden turns or weave in and out of traffic make your course steady so that drivers can anticipate your position use hand signals to indicate a turn or better yet invest in an electric turn signal or use the old courier method of physically inserting yourself in front of the car that may turn into you road users are legally obliged to make signals in most countries and even if you are not it is necessary for your safety to make sure that the people around you are aware of what you are about to do don t allow a tailgating car to bully you into squeezing into the side of the road when it s not safe it s better to slow down traffic than to put yourself in danger when there s enough room on the road for you to pull to the side safely do so and let the cars behind you pass exercise caution when riding in the rain metal surfaces are slick and your ability to stop isn t as good many cars not using their turn signals will turn a bit before stopping learn to look for this indicator the driver s movements can also offer clues to their next moves plan for hauling your things you will need something in which to carry your work items there are many types of bicycle luggage carriers backpacks or messenger bags might work but the lack of airflow against your body may generate more sweat in warmer climates look for a stabilizing strap around your waist or ribs to keep the bag from shifting while you pedal smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb d d9 commute by bicycle step 9 version

around the seams or openings it s smart to wrap your clothes in plastic bags as well as keep spares at the workplace shoes socks and underwear at least a full change of clothes if there s room folding shirts can lead to big creases so if you need to look smart try rolling your clothes instead of folding them consider wearing riding clothes and safety gear during your commute often bicycles are not easily accommodated in cities and drivers are not used to sharing the road many people feel much safer with a cycle helmet a bike helmet will protect your head when you are mounting and dismounting common times for falls and it will make you more visible to motorists it will also offer some protection for your head if you have a crash when riding helmets are single use so throw yours away if it s done its job in a crash cracks or flaws are not always discernible to the eye and a new helmet is cheaper than a new head many people choose not to wear their work clothes when they re riding to work if the weather is unpredictable or hot see tips prepare an outfit specifically for rainy days generally what you wear depends on your budget and comfort but during bad weather it s important to be prepared stock up on ponchos rubber overshoes and waterproof gloves look for jackets with ventilating zippers under the arms grocery bags can waterproof a helmet in a snap as well as your seat if it has a porous cover waterproof socks or overshoes are useless unless you have pants to direct the rain over and away from the tops of the socks wool is more expensive and takes special care but it provides a wider range of comfort in the weather than other clothes even keeping you warm when wet don t wear anything that can get caught in the chain or wheels tuck your shoestrings into your right shoe and get a strap to wrap your long pants cuff around your right ankle so that nothing gets caught in your chain ring in humid areas use wicking polyester materials to keep sweat from fostering a skin fungus allow these clothes to dry fully rotating out two sets every other day wash them with mild detergent and dry on low heat hack your bike as needed some extras could make a huge difference in the quality of your ride consider installing fenders on your bicycle to prevent puddles from splashing onto your bike and your body the rat tail fenders that clamp onto your seat post are only minimally effective invest in a set of full fenders stainless steel though heavy is the best most durable solution next best is aluminum bonded to plastic polycarbonate fenders will also do the job but they are of significantly lower quality also be aware that some bicycles especially those designed for racing have very little clearance for installing fenders comfy seats are worth investing in on upright bikes but don t get one that s too big or they will get in the way and chafe seats with a recessed area down the middle reduce pressure on our sensitive areas more padding does not mean more comfortable if the saddle is too soft numbness can become a problem experiment and see which saddle is right for you stay away from gel padded seats they break down under exposure to the elements and create an impossible mess get a mirror you wouldn t drive a car without a rear view mirror would you you can find mirrors that fit on your handlebars your helmet even your glasses get at least one of these at some point you might end up having to ride in the dark as a precautionary measure install lights on your bicycle you don t want to be riding on the roads at night with standard reflectors and riding a bicycle without lights after dark is illegal in some countries install a white light on the front and red light on the back of your bike for after dark led technology is very advanced now offering great lights at easy prices look for units that use aaa or aa batteries which can be swapped out for rechargeable batteries lights with their own rechargeable batteries are more expensive and generally brighter these are for seeing where you are going if you have a nicer road bike and don t feel comfortable locking it outside consider the purchase of a full bike bag which will allow you to roll your bike wheels and all into the bag and carry it inside the bags weigh only about 5 pounds and can be carried quite easily in a backpack if your building has security guards consider a nice holiday bribe they ll call your bag the big laptop stick with it your legs and rear end might be sore for a few days or weeks don t give up you ll get used to the workout soon and you ll start noticing new muscles in your legs keep moving forward and enjoy the scenery don t get sold on buying a mountain bike just because there are a lot of them bike shops are accustomed to stocking bikes for recreation not for commuting and the features on mountain bikes don t really benefit you as a commuter unless you re the aggressive type and need a more sturdy steed swap out the knobbies for durable slicks in this case but don t bother with full suspension if most of your riding will presumably be done on pavement you re better off with a hybrid comfort touring road or singlespeed designed for riding on pavement you may also want to consider a recumbent bicycle ultimately the most important factors when choosing a bike are comfort and efficiency hybrids and comfort bikes are the same thing but have a wider version of the road bike wheel and tire hybrid or smooth version of the mountain bike sized wheel and tire comfort the hybrid is a bit more efficient where the comfort bike takes the bumps better both feature a very comfy and upright pedaling position good for taking the strain off your body touring bikes are beefier versions of road bikes but with more relaxed pedaling position though usually not as relaxed as comfort hybrid bikes converted road and track bikes are quite the rage in flatter areas with a single gear to maintain and no shifting to learn track bikes have a fixed gear so no rear brake is needed once you ve gotten the hang of these stripped down speed machines watch out for your knees though a fixed gear means the pedals are directly linked to the rear wheel eliminating the bike s ability to coast advanced fixer cyclists can ride a fixed gear bike in reverse by back pedaling a recumbent whose lower center of gravity also takes getting used to has a more powerful pedalling position which is infinitely more comfortable faster recumbent bikes have pedals higher than or level with the seat lower pedals indicate a more comfort oriented recumbent most recumbent bikes offer better aerodynamics than other bikes once you get up to speed as well as a seat back to add leverage against the pedals the lower point of view makes you wish you could see through cars sometimes and must be recognized longer recumbent wheelbases are more stable where shorter wheelbases are quicker and more maneuverable test rides are generally offered at good recumbent shops so take your time choosing and testing if you re looking to avoid the body pains of upright bikes carbon fiber bikes generally don t allow bolt on accessories such as panniers and kickstands this means that if you buy a carbon fiber bike you will most likely have to use a backpack which can be hot on a summer day also it may be more likely to fall over without a

40mm can be good in mud spray the entire frame with lube for simple muddy conditions this can help to repel mud build up on the frame use a thick lube oil for the chain it needs to be thick to stay on in the face of the mud although it s more expensive chain wax is preferable as it won t hold the grit from the mud like lube will a heavy lubricant protectant dissolved in a lighter carrier such as a motorcycle chain lube or boeshield t 9 is easier to apply but still clings tightly 2 x research source keep tire pressure low about 35 40psi this allows the tire to mold itself better in the conditions change the brake pads before leaving or take a spare pair brake pads wear down to the pegs or housing when you re constantly descending muddy declines if it s wet the mud acts like sandpaper grinding away add mud guards to the down tube and front wheel to protect the front as best as possible make sure the gears are well cleaned before setting out mud can cause them to jump around otherwise 3 x research source if you are a serious mud rider make sure that your brake cables and gear cables are of high quality to allow for smooth shifts and braking when the mud is severe practice getting used to mud gradually mud riding takes some getting used to initially and it s important to realize that mud from one season may well be very different from mud that forms in another

corners can cause you to slip right over when approaching corners be prepared stand up if a wheel spins use the brake sparingly when approaching corners 6 x research source the wetter the trail the more grip you ll have when there is a choice always opt for trail that you can see over trail covered in mud and or water grass parts of a trail can provide traction between mud however roots and rocks can make it very slippery and require experienced technique 7 x research source beware ditches of water especially as a beginner and don t accidentally ride into them many trails have ditches to ensure that the water runs down the sides of the trail rather than eroding the trail this is true for walking hiking biking skiing and horse riding trails in general these can be useful for grip and cleaning the bike on occasion be thoughtful sometimes the challenge is so great that it escapes your mind that yet another bike riding this trail is causing erosion and damage for the trail for future riders for other users and for the environment itself if the trail is in such a bad state that riding it will just result in leaving great gouges and ruts forgo the ride until the weather improves or find a trail that s less messed up learn some techniques for riding through mud begin your sprint far before your bicycle reaches the mud patch when approaching the mud patch stay loose in the saddle and prepare for slippage where possible keep closer to vegetation where the line on the trail will be less likely to be as muddy 8 x research source when faced with slippage at high speeds do not lean your bike one way or another or your tires will slip out and you will fall instead steer with your handlebars and steer with preciseness this will require a little leaning however it still gives your

city commuters have taken to buying folding bikes which can be taken aboard the transjakarta busway shuttle they ride it from their house to the busway and from the busway to their office others who do not have to commute so far prefer light non folding bikes that can be carried up highway crosswalks without much effort even if you can afford a really expensive and fancy bike don t get one get a bike that s reasonably priced don t provoke thieves unnecessarily find out whether your company provides any parking for bicycles as in many developing countries the bicycle ranks low on the totem pole and it is the odd person read eccentric who chooses a bicycle as a commuter if that person has the means to get a motorized vehicle that said you may have to train your company s security personnel to provide you with a sheltered and secure bike parking stowage area buy bike locks for both front and back wheels locks that can be extended to anchor against something immovable if you have a fancy seat and seat post buy a lock for that too jakarta is after all a big city know which lever corresponds to which brake on your bicycle american market bicycles have rear brakes connected to the right hand lever while japan and china and indonesian bikes connect to the left this is important information if you do not want to be thrown off your bike in a panic stop accessorize properly contrary to the common conception of accessories being optional there are accessories that are absolutely necessary if you re going to bike buy lights head lights and tail lights pack lights do not depend on the dynamo driven front lights if you have them add battery powered led lights the visibility sets you out to drivers as different from the run of the mill cyclist and this awareness of you could save your life take care not to obstruct your taillight when stowing your backpack on the passenger carrier buy a bike bell or any sound device a clear ringing bike bell it could save you from some very minor crashes in the back streets and may alert many pedestrians and to overtake a cart or rickshaw have goggles or polarized clip ons you don t have to wear them all the time but they are particularly useful in certain seasons of the year when traveling at dawn or dusk when there are lots of flying insects that could easily get in your eyes have a basket if possible and certainly a passenger rack seat in back two or three short strap down bungee cords as well a basket is a very useful utility tool the bungee cords will stow your backpack perfectly on the passenger rack panniers are nice but they are uncommon and expensive in jakarta dress differently it does not pay to dress plainly if you re going on a bike you want to stand out be different be visible and thus be treated differently hopefully deferentially it does not hurt to dress like a person who can very well afford a car but prefers to ride a bike this results in policemen and container truck drivers taking extra care around you bring a change of clothes depending on office circumstances you may or may not have showers in any case it feels better to have a fresh shirt at the office load your bicycle properly it is common for newbies to load the front basket heavily not realizing that this makes steering tricky and difficult it is better to place your goodies in a knapsack that you can strap down on the passenger seat behind you with the bungee cords in the rare instance that you have two heavy bags tie them like saddle bags to the far rear away from the path of your feet as you pedal using tying straws take care that they do not obstruct the spokes listen for road noises do not wear noise cancelling earbuds headphones as hearing comprises a large part of your road awareness it is easy to teach yourself to listen for the deep bass sound of container and cargo trucks but it is more difficult to train yourself to hear the sound of mini cargo trucks like the isuzu elf always defer to motorized traffic when riding in a pack with them pull over on the shoulder and stop let them pass and then proceed beware of motorcycle riders they are for the most part your biggest nemesis on the road as most are undisciplined and reckless always assume they will cut your path or charge ahead instead of slowing down let them pass when they are bunched together such as at a stoplight when a public transportation suddenly stops ahead of you and you are not certain of the traffic behind you stop rather than overtake it may be a nuisance but it is certainly better than bodily injury do not travel on a bicycle after or between rain squalls the road will be slick and it s not worth the risk always choose to travel when it is still light only travel at night or at dawn twilight when absolutely necessary be extra careful and deferential to motor vehicles when traveling at night smile and wave at the guards and regulars along your path it is common practice in indonesia for companies to hire blue guards to stop traffic to allow their employees to drive in and out of their company compounds knowing the guards makes it more likely that these guards will be aware of your presence on the road and be more considerate of stopping you cold unless absolutely necessary besides it makes for a great morning when your road friends greet you on your way to work listen for driver s alerts if you hear a vehicle honking behind you trying to overtake you pull aside immediately and decrease your speed and let the vehicle pass you many of jakarta s streets are quite narrow bicycle lanes in the city bicycle lanes are very rare so if there are no bicycle lanes on the street road ride your bike at the very left side of the street road too let other vehicles pass you signaling if you are turning right or left do not immediately turn check to see traffic coming up behind you if you are mid lane a series of head turns toward the direction you intend to go will serve to indicate you intentions but still do so slowly and carefully remember that the motorcycle guys are the most unpredictable,Sports-and-Fitness
how to start biking,getting into the habit of biking daily can be quite easy so long as you get the right equipment and don t get too ambitious at the beginning to start choose between a road or mountain bike based on the type of terrain that you ll be biking on then get a solid helmet and download a cycling app that will make it easy to track your distance and speed start off with a small goal of biking 1 5 mi 1 6 8 0 km per ride bike 2 4 times a week based on your level of comfort until you re able to bike for longer distances more regularly,get a mountain bike if you want to ride on unpaved surfaces mountain bikes aren t exclusively for mountains if you plan on regularly riding on dirt unpaved gravel or grass select a mountain bike to make your experience more comfortable mountain bikes are heavier and have strong frames which helps keep them from breaking or losing traction on rocky terrain or bumpy surfaces 1 x research source if you re going to be biking over long distances look for a bike with a clip for your water bottle mountain bikes can be kind of heavy and bulky if you plan on keeping it in your home keep the storage space in mind when looking at a bike a used mountain bike will usually cost 100 300 new mountain bikes tend to be at least 400 but you ll regularly see prices in the 1000 2000 range select a lightweight road bicycle if you ll be riding on paved roads if you re going to be doing most of your biking on streets or paved trails select a road bike road bikes are smaller than mountain bikes and have thinner wheels which makes it easier to get them up to a higher speed road bikes are also lighter which makes them easier to steer carry and maneuver 2 x research source if you live in an apartment and will ever have to bring your bike inside a road bike will be easier to store than a mountain bike used mountain and road bikes tend to be equally expensive expect to spend 100 300 on a used road bike a new road bike will cost 400 1000 racing bicycles are a type of road bike they tend to be extremely light and they re designed to go as fast as possible on paved surfaces they tend to be quite expensive and fragile though so don t pick a racing bike to start unless you re always going to be biking on smooth pavement with no obstacles get a folding bicycle if you re tight on space or live in an apartment if you live in a second or third floor apartment or you have no storage space whatsoever buy a folding bicycle folding bikes can be easily disassembled to make them smaller and they are extremely lightweight however they can t go very fast and they re awful at making it up hills this makes folding bikes an excellent option if your only purpose is to make short trips in a congested area 3 x research source folding bikes are usually a little cheaper than a mountain or road bike new folding bikes are usually 100 300 but they re even cheaper if you can find a used one buy a used bike if you re just starting out the cost differential between new and used bikes can be quite extreme you can get a solid used bike for 150 but a decent model that is brand new may cost you 500 1 000 since you re just starting out you may not know what your preferences are if you get a new bike and it turns out that it isn t right for you you ll be out quite a bit of money on the other hand selling a used bike and getting a different model isn t that big of a deal 4 x research source used bikes aren t necessarily worse than new bikes they just tend to not be as shiny and may not have a ton of features a used bike can ride just as well as a new bike though avoid a custom or fixed gear bike until you re used to biking regularly to save yourself some money and heartbreak wait until you know precisely what you re looking for before buying a custom or fixed gear bike fixed gear bikes don t have brakes and they can be quite difficult to get used to if you ve never controlled one custom bikes will come with features and components that you won t even notice unless you re a veteran rider 5 x research source custom bikes use specific buyer requested components to achieve a certain weight balance feel and frame structure this is unnecessary for someone that s just starting out go to a reputable bike shop and get a bike that feels right don t buy your bike online instead go to a local bike shop and ask to test ride some models that look interesting to you when taking a test ride make sure that the bike is comfortable and feels good in your hands your bike should be easy to maneuver and pedal once you ve found a bike that you like pay for it and enjoy your new ride 6 x research source while some high end bike shops don t sell used models almost every other bike shop sells used bikes don t worry if the bike squeaks when you ride it the shop will adjust the brakes and oil the chain for you before you walk off with it buy a bike with gears this will make it easier to control how fast you pedal almost all road and mountain bikes have gears the gears look like little knobs or switches on the handlebar that you can turn to change the track that the chain is on buy a new helmet that fits your head comfortably a helmet is mandatory if you want to ride a bike get a helmet with a hard shell that fits your head the helmet should be tight enough that it doesn t fall off while you re riding but loose enough that it doesn t hurt when you wear it for an extended period of time 7 x research source the difference in pricing between helmets is usually based on how aerodynamic or stylish it is unless you plan on racing in the future go ahead and grab a cheaper model feel free to spend a little for a fashionable helmet though select a comfortable pair of bike shorts if you re taking long rides all of the fancy bike clothing isn t mandatory for an amateur cyclist although it does serve a purpose if you are certain that biking is going to become a regular activity for you pick up a comfortable pair of bike shorts bike shorts are tighter and usually made of spandex or nylon they re designed to keep your thighs from chaffing and your pants from catching in the chain as you ride 8 x research source you can ride a bike while wearing regular pants if you d like sweatpants jeans and athletic shorts are all perfectly fine to bike in if you do find your pants getting caught in the chain regularly roll your left pant leg up to keep it raised about the gears purchase a cycling jersey if you want to stay dry while you ride bike jerseys are tight fitting nylon or spandex shirts they tend to be brightly colored so that you re highly visible when riding at night they re also highly absorbent and will soak up sweat as you ride to keep you dry get a comfortable bike jersey that fits well to stay dray and visible 9 x research source again specialized cycling clothing isn t required if you re a beginner you can easily ride in a t shirt tank top sweater or jacket if you re going to wear a regular shirt and bike at night throw on a reflective vest so that drivers and pedestrians can easily see you wear athletic shoes before moving up to cycling shoes cycling shoes have ridges that hook into the grooves of some bike pedals since you re probably starting out with standard pedals they aren t necessary wear a good pair of tennis or running shoes when starting out tie your laces tight and double knot your shoes to keep the laces from getting caught in the chain if they do get caught regularly you can tuck your laces into your shoes before you get on your bike 10 x research source the other purpose of cycling shoes is to make your energy transfer more efficient as you ride your goal when starting out should be to maintain a good posture and get in the habit of biking though if you only care about speed you re going to get frustrated when you start biking get an air pump to avoid making frequent trips to the gas station the air in bike tires naturally escapes over time even if you don t have a punctured tire and keep your air valve capped tight to avoid having to ride to the gas station every couple of weeks get an air pump to refill your bike s tires 11 x research source get a manual pump if you want to save money buy an electric or mechanical air pump if you want to make filling your tires easier download a cycling app to track your distance and speed instead of spending money on a fancy pedometer or gps system download an app to track how far and fast you bike bike computer strava and mapmyride are the most popular apps for bikers they ll track your speed route and monitor how often you ride this information is important when it comes to tracking your progress 12 x research source strava bike computer and mapmyride are all free you can download them from your phone s app store you can connect a bluetooth heart rate monitor to strava and bike computer if you d like adjust the saddle so that your knee is slightly bent as you pedal when your pedals are the closest to the ground your knee should be slightly bent to avoid putting stress on your tendons and hamstrings adjust your saddle by lifting the latch and pulling it out to the unlocked position then slide your seat up or down to adjust its height close the latch and press it tight to lock your seat in place 13 x research source develop a posture that s comfortable for you to maintain there is no proper stance for typical cycling but the straighter you can keep your spine the better when riding your bike keep the crest of the seat aligned with the center of your tailbone stay seated while pedaling and try to sit up straight while staying comfortable the more relaxed you are while you ride the more likely you are to bike for an extended period of time 14 x research source ride with your hands in the drops of the handles to steer and brake the drops of the handles refer to the loop where the handles dip down place both hands on the bottom of the handle to make steering and braking easier on a mountain bike there are no drops so place your hands where it s comfortable and easy to reach the brakes 15 x research source when you do brake use the back brake to make gradual stops if you need to make an emergency stop pull both brakes at the same time pulling the front brake as light as possible to avoid flipping over develop a pedaling cadence of 70 90 rpm to bike efficiently when biking your body is most efficient when it s pedaling a little over once per second to develop a good pedaling pattern turn the gears on the front of your bike until you can comfortably bike at a rate of 70 90 rotations per minute rpm this will require some trial and error so switch your gears around as you start to ride to determine what works best for you 16 x research source the gears control which track the chain hangs on which changes the amount of resistance that you experience as you pedal they re designed to make it easier to maintain your pace while biking up or down a hill on flat surfaces use them to adjust how fast you need to pedal almost all racing and mountain bikes have gears look down the road or trail as you re biking to avoid obstacles to avoid running into potholes rocks or obstructions look up while you re biking your first temptation may be to look down at your handlebar to focus on your body s motions but this can be dangerous keep your eyes 90 150 feet 27 46 m down the road or trail to avoid running into something 17 x research source it s fine if it s a little more comfortable for you to tilt your head down just make sure that you re looking up while you do this communicate with drivers by using hand signals on public roads to avoid startling drivers communicate when you plan to stop or turn to indicate that you are turning left extend your left arm straight away from your body for a right turn extend your left arm and bend your elbow at a 90 degree angle pointing up to indicate that you are stopping or slowing down extend your left arm with your elbow bent pointing down this way drivers will know when you are turning moving or stopping 18 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source hand signals are made with the left arm because the right hand controls the back brake this is the more important brake for cyclists since the front brake should never be pulled on its own if you are absolutely certain that you won t need to brake feel free to indicate right turns by extending your right arm out begin with a smaller goal of biking 1 5 mi 1 6 8 0 km per ride if you start out with a massive goal of biking 50 miles 80 km a week you ll struggle to reach your goal start out with a small achievable with a goal of 1 5 miles 1 6 8 0 km per ride you can always work your way up to longer rides over time starting small will ensure that you aren t discouraged by not reaching your objective it will also prevent injuries from the impact of long rides before your body is ready for it 19 x research source if you re really new to biking you can start even smaller choose a quiet 4 5 block route with little to no traffic practice riding that route perfectly before moving up to a longer more difficult ride track your distance during each session using a cycling app bike 2 4 times a week to give your body time to heal between rides after your first ride you re probably going to be quite sore overworking your body is a surefire way to discourage yourself from biking take days off between rides so that you re biking 2 4 times a week based on your level of comfort 20 x research source if you re starting to bike so that you can get to work or school every day start out by biking 2 3 times a week drive or take public transportation on the days that you re taking off work up to a full week over time make a habit of biking by tracking how often you ride it s hard to start a new habit if you don t have accountability in a journal write down how often you ride each day note the distance that you biked as well review your results at the end of the week to determine whether or not you ve reached your goal by tracking how often you actually bike you ll know for sure whether you re getting in the swing of regularly biking 21 x research source it will become easier to reach your goal over time as you get used to cycling and tracking your progress avoid routes that include hills or rough terrain until you re ready to ensure that you don t harm yourself stick with flat simple routes to start off minimize the number of turns that you need to take and stay away from hills or rocky roads it takes skill to navigate difficult routes until you have some experience you re better off playing it safe 22 x research source staying on flat roads with few obstructions allows you to get comfortable with the act of pedaling without needing to pay attention to your terrain find a biking group that takes scheduled rides together if you find it hard to get in the habit of biking regularly look into joining a cycling group cycling groups are a set of people that ride together on scheduled trips and having a set of people to bike with will keep you motivated go to your local bike shop and ask around for a group to ride with you can also search online for a beginner level bike group that s open to new members 23 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to adjust a shimano front derailleur,any shimano cyclist knows how frustrating it is to be unable to shift gears just as you are coming to an important point of your ride the culprit is more often than not a maladjusted front derailleur when the front derailleur comes out of alignment it prevents the chain in the bicycle from moving between higher and lower gears there is no need to panic if this happens and it is actually something that you can fix on your own all you need is a phillips screwdriver and about 20 minutes,make sure your derailleur sits at the correct height the derailleur should fall around 1 to 3 millimetres 0 039 to 0 118 in above the large chain ring 1 x research source when the derailleur cage sits too far above the chainring this can cause the bike to shift poorly if it is too far below the derailleur will rub against the chain rings 2 x research source fixing the height is a subtle adjustment based on a difference of millimeters you will need to be precise having your bike on a repair stand can make this work easier you can use a penny to try and estimate if you have adjusted to the right height as a penny is 1 5 millimetres 0 059 in thick 3 x research source adjust the height with the positioning clamp this clamp is what connects the derailleur to the frame of your bike loosen the derailleur clamp bolt by turning it clockwise and adjust the height as necessary then tighten the bolt back up 4 x research source this should be done while your bike is on its lowest gear so that there is not too much tension on the inner wire 5 x research source check to make sure the derailleur cage is at the right height shift to your middle front chainring and see if the cage is sitting properly if not shift back into low gear and re adjust the height with the positioning clamp 6 x research source check to see if the angle of the derailleur is parallel to the chainrings the derailleur cage and the chainrings should be parallel if they are not you will have to make adjustments it is easier to see what adjustments you have to make while you are looking down at the derailleur from above envision an alignment between the center of the cage and the centerline of the bike frame readjust the bolt to the correct positioning loosen the bolt that is attaching the frame of the bike to the derailleur shift to the lowest gear of the bike and turn the derailleur to the right position 7 x research source once you have the angle set in the proper place you can tighten the positioning clamp 8 x research source loosen the front derailleur barrel adjuster turn the barrel adjuster completely clockwise in order to release tension in the cable this can be readjusted later on set the inner limit screw to prevent the derailleur cage from moving past the inner chainring shift the rear derailleur into the largest cog in the back and front derailleur into the smallest cog using a screwdriver twist the inner limit screw until the inner part of the cage is as close to the chain as possible without touching it 9 x research source you can try spinning the crank to make sure the chain is not catching 10 x research source the inner screw of the derailleur is usually the one closer to the frame that controls the lower limit this screw is sometimes marked as l 11 x research source adjust cable tension loosen the cable that is attached to the derailleur at the anchor bolt tighten this cable as much as possible and then make the anchor bolt tight again it can be helpful to use needle nose pliers while doing this but you don t have to set the outer limit screw to stop the derailleur cage from moving past the outer chainring 12 x research source shift the front derailleur up into the largest chainring and the rear derailleur into the smallest cog turn the outer limit screw with a screwdriver until the outer derailleur cage is as close to the chain as possible without touching it setting this limit will make sure that the chain does not over shift and fall out again 13 x research source the outer or second screw is the one that controls how far the derailleur shifts outwardly this screw is sometimes marked as h 14 x research source test to see if the derailleur is shifting correctly shift through the whole range of gears on your bike the derailleur should be able to shift into small and large chainrings without rubbing on the chain 15 x research source use the barrel adjuster to tweak the position of the derailleur try twisting the barrel adjuster a few quarters of a turn counterclockwise to fine tune the position 16 x research source this will increase the tension so that it shifts into the larger chainring if you can push the derailleur out it can mean your cable tension is not right turn the barrel adjuster to fix this start trimming while you are riding trimming means making small adjustments while you are riding your bike doing this will help to protect the chain from rubbing against the derailleur 17 x research source this will prevent the derailleur from coming out of alignment again shimano bicycles come with a half click on the lever so that you can make these adjustments easily ride your bicycle as you normally would things should be running smoothly now if the derailleur becomes misaligned again you may have to do a more thorough job in fixing it next time if you feel like you can t fix it yourself you can ask a bike mechanic for help,Sports-and-Fitness
how to ride a bike with two people,have you ever been in a situation where two people are coming back from the same place but only one person has a bike well if you have it s a struggle because normally the person without a bike wants to ride one too here is a simple solution on how to fit two people on a single bike and ride it safely,have the more experienced cyclist mount first in preparing to go the first person should hold the handlebars firmly and stand both feet flat on the ground while the other person mounts the other person should then sit down on the seat and put their feet on the rear axles while holding onto the first person it is much easier if the person in front has a backpack the person in front should put their foot on the pedal and gently take off this is difficult but you have to keep the bike as straight up and down as possible or else the takeoff is nearly impossible the person in front should stand up while pedaling but if their legs get tired and they re riding a man s style bicycle they can sit on the tube but they can t sit directly on it it hurts they have to sit on one side of that particular body part if you have a mountain bike you could try having the second person sit on the handlebars have the second person mount the handlebars and hold on then have driver use legs to gain some momentum once speed is gained driver can pedal like normal note driver can alternate from which side of neck he looks on and the rider on handlebars can leave their legs dangling in the air the faster you go the easier it is to balance this method is quite fun it is easy to go fast for the rider to dismount all they need to do is hop off,Sports-and-Fitness
how to drift on a bicycle,drifting also known as skidding when you re doing it on a bike is a technique where you approach a corner on your bike at a high speed and move around the turn as your back tire loses traction with the ground to successfully skid around a corner you should lean into the turn as you re going around it and shift your body weight forward skidding on a bike takes practice but once you get the hang of it you can use the technique to improve your speed and ride private downhill trails with ease,pedal quickly toward a turn the faster you re going when you get to the turn the easier it will be to get your back tire to skid riding downhill toward a turn can help you pick up speed 1 x research source lean in the direction of the turn once you reach it shift your body weight in the direction you re turning so your body and bike are at about a 45 degree angle from the ground keep leaning as you go around the corner of the turn 2 x research source for example if you re taking a left turn lean your body to the left shift your weight forward as you go around the turn to shift your weight lean slightly forward over your handlebars this will lighten the load on your back tire which will let it skid off the ground as you re going around the turn you should start to feel your back tire skidding outward gently press the rear brake if you need help getting the tire to break loose 3 x research source extend your inside foot out so it s hovering slightly above the ground your inside foot is your foot that s closest to the inside corner of the turn continue to hold your foot out just above the ground as you go around the turn 4 x research source for example if you re taking a right turn your right foot would be your inside foot if you feel like you re skidding out of control or your bike is going to spin out plant your inside foot on the ground to stabilize yourself bring your body and bike upright again once you complete the turn this will help your back tire regain traction after skidding to bring yourself upright on your bike stop leaning into the turn and pull your body weight up 5 x research source practice skidding at slower speeds first skidding is easier when you re going faster but higher speeds can increase your chances of wiping out when you first start out approach turns slowly and work on leaning into the turn and shifting your weight forward once you get the motions down gradually increase your speed going into the turn 6 x research source try skidding in a gravel parking lot before you practice on a trail use cones or another marker to indicate where you should turn in the parking lot then pedal toward that spot and try to get your back tire to skid outward as you go around the turn practicing in a parking lot is safer than practicing on a downhill trail and you won t have to worry about damaging the trail 7 x research source skid around wide round turns when you re starting out thin sharp turns give you less room for error and less time to skid so they re not the best to practice on look for turns that are round and wide so you have more time to work on your form as you go around them 8 x research source be persistent skidding is an advanced biking move and it can take a lot of practice to get it down if you keep spinning out or your back tire isn t skidding outward try adjusting how much you re leaning in and shifting your weight forward you can even ask someone to film you practicing so you can see what your form looks like keep practicing and eventually you ll get there,Sports-and-Fitness
how to heal a saddle sore,if you re a frequent cyclist whether competitively or for exercise you ll likely end up with a saddle sore at some point cyclists use the phrase saddle sore to refer to different things but usually the term refers to a small tender spot in an area where the chamois of your cycling shorts contacts your body saddle sores typically look like a pimple or an ingrown hair but they can feel like a pebble in your shorts when you re riding thankfully most saddle sores can be healed at home in just a few days time you only need to see your doctor if the spot becomes infected or you can t seem to get rid of them no matter what you do 1 x research source,look for a raised pink or red spot in an area that rubs your saddle saddle sores typically look like a pimple or an ingrown hair the spot itself typically is very small in relation to how it feels 2 x research source if you have multiple saddle sores in the same area they may have the appearance of a rash similar to razor burn apply ice to reduce swelling when you first get a saddle sore it might be swollen and inflamed an ice pack can help reduce the inflammation and also numbs the area so it won t be as painful 3 x research source wrap the ice pack in a soft towel or washcloth so that it doesn t directly touch your skin apply the ice pack off and on for 1 to 5 minutes at a time but don t leave it on for more than 20 minutes at a time you can do this as often as every 2 hours while you re awake during the first 24 to 48 hours after you get the saddle sore take a break from cycling for a day or two depending on the location of your saddle sore riding might be excruciating regardless additional pressure and friction won t help your saddle sore heal any faster 4 x research source if you re training for a race and can t afford to take a day or two off at least ride a different bike with a different saddle for a couple of days that will change the pressure points so you re not rubbing directly against the saddle sore keep your chamois area as clean as possible take a shower in the morning in the evening and anytime after you ve worked up a sweat a quick rinse might be all you need make sure you dry yourself thoroughly especially the area around your saddle sore 5 x research source use a mild fragrance free soap or shower gel to avoid further irritation to your skin dab the saddle sore with an over the counter acne gel any over the counter acne gel with 10 benzoyl peroxide will treat your saddle sore and help it heal faster make sure your skin is clean and completely dry before you dab the medication on the spot 6 x research source give the gel a minute or two to dry before you put any clothing on over the spot if you wash the area you may want to reapply the gel wear lightweight clothing to let your skin breathe friction and moisture are the enemy of a saddle sore to ensure that it heals as quickly as possible wear light loose fitting clothing that won t rub up against the saddle sore a skirt or kilt is the ideal choice but if you don t feel comfortable wearing that type of clothing try loose shorts or lounge pants 7 x research source if your underwear chafes against your saddle sore you might want to go without for a day or two looser fitting boxer shorts are also an option sleeping in the nude can also help saddle sores heal faster because your crotch will stay dry and not rub against any clothing 8 x research source use over the counter anti inflammatory medication as needed saddle sores can range from mildly irritating to excruciatingly painful depending on the location and severity if you have trouble going about your normal daily activities because of pain from a saddle sore an over the counter anti inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen advil motrin ib can help 9 x research source follow the instructions on the bottle and don t take over the counter medications regularly for more than a day or two if you still feel as though you need the medication after 2 or 3 days you might want to have a doctor take a look at your saddle sores recognize the symptoms of a more serious saddle sore if your saddle sores last for more than 2 weeks or are causing excruciating pain they may be infected or require other medical treatment symptoms of a saddle sore that might require a visit to the doctor include 10 x research source serious pain pus oozing out of the sore fever and chills visit your general practitioner if a saddle sore becomes infected if you happen to break the skin or pop a saddle sore there s a chance it can become infected once infection sets in you ll typically need antibiotics 11 x research source your regular doctor can examine your saddle sores and tell you if they re infected if you suspect an infection or if you have broken skin it s typically better to see a doctor as soon as possible rather than take a wait and see approach take antibiotics as prescribed if you do have infected saddle sores your doctor will likely prescribe you a round of antibiotics you ll likely notice that your symptoms disappear after a day or two however continue to take the full round of antibiotics you were prescribed 12 x research source if you stop taking antibiotics before you ve finished the full round it s likely the infection will return the returned infection might be more severe or harder to treat as a result talk to a dermatologist if you have recurring saddle sores if you re doing everything you can to prevent and treat saddle sores but they keep coming back you may have an underlying skin issue that s causing them a dermatologist can examine your skin and help determine the problem they may prescribe a stronger topical or oral medication to provide you some relief 13 x research source keep a log of when you get saddle sores their approximate location and how long it takes for them to heal this log can help the dermatologist get to the root of the problem more quickly find a saddle that fits and suits your riding style saddle sores typically happen when your saddle is chafing against your chamois area as you ride if your saddle fits properly it shouldn t cause this problem however you might find that you need to swap out your saddle especially if your riding style has changed recently 14 x research source choose an ergonomic saddle that minimizes contact with your groin not only will this protect you against saddle sore it can also prevent impotence in male riders and sensitivity in female riders which can result from the saddle pressing on the nerves in your groin if you re a more aggressive sprint rider look for a saddle that relieves pressure toward the front endurance riders who favor long rides on the other hand will want more padding in the rear your saddle should also be the appropriate width for your anatomy bike shops typically have tools to measure and find the best width for you however it can take a little bit of trial and error to get it right when you re breaking in a new saddle start with shorter rides and gradually increase the distance to avoid getting saddle sores while you adjust to the new saddle 15 x research source wear cycling shorts that fit well and have a smooth chamois if you previously weren t getting saddle sores and now you do your favorite cycling shorts might be worn out look for rough seams that might be causing extra chafing a one piece liner or one without a center seam typically causes the least amount of chafing 16 x research source try different brands to see which ones are the most comfortable once you find a brand you like it s a good idea to get 2 or 3 pairs so you always have a backup shower before and after your ride you re less likely to get saddle sores if your chamois area is clean and dry a quick rinse before you ride ensures that your skin is clean after your ride a nice hot shower will wash off the sweat as well as any creams or lubricants you were wearing 17 x research source take your after ride shower immediately after you finish your ride walking around in sweaty shorts is a good way to get saddle sores even if the ride itself is not to blame take your shorts off and wash them immediately after cycling as soon as you come in from your ride take off your bike shorts and put them in the wash because you re not wearing underwear with your bike shorts they can be a haven for bacteria and should not be worn more than once 18 x research source standing around in your shorts after a ride allows bacteria to remain in contact with your skin which can cause saddle sores or make any sores you already have worse use a chamois cream if you re prone to saddle sores chamois creams reduce friction and also have anti bacterial ingredients that prevent bacteria from penetrating your skin and causing saddle sores these creams also typically have aloe vera or other soothing ingredients that will calm inflammation 19 x research source if you re not sure which cream would be best to you talk to other cyclists or someone who works at your favorite bike shop they ll likely have a recommendation you might also want to try several different creams so you can decide which one you like the best adjust your riding position on your bike frequently the more you move the less pressure you re putting on your crotch stand and stretch for 15 to 20 seconds every 5 minutes or so while you re riding 20 x research source you can use natural acceleration points such as short hills to get your stretching in standing when you see rough pavement also keeps the saddle from putting undue pressure on your crotch,Sports-and-Fitness
how to become a professional cyclist,although the main goal of cycling should be to have fun you can also pursue a career as a professional cyclist professional cyclists compete in races such as the giro d italia the tour de france and other events across the globe to see which cyclist and which team can make the fastest time read the following steps to learn how to become a professional cyclist,cycle every day training and experience are the foundations of any sport and for a professional cyclist this means making lots of miles on the road on average you should train at least 2 hours a day for 6 days a week if you want to become a professional cyclist if the weather is too cold to cycle outside train on a stationary bike in a gym or at home training for pro cycling usually takes up about 4 to 6 hours a day though sometimes that might include time spent at the gym doing weights and building strength build your strength do a 60 minute strength training workout a couple of times a week to build your muscles specifically your leg and core muscles you will generally need to be in great shape with lots of lean muscle good example exercises include squats leg curls and lunges eat right to fuel your workouts you ll need to eat right to maintain your body through the grueling challenges of the sport get all of the nutrients your body needs both at home and during a race to help your body keep up your diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables as well as carbs and lean protein increase your power by using tools and adding resistance pro cyclists need to be able to chug up a hill even when the end of a race is near and their body is already tired work on increasing your power so that you can cope with situations like these add resistance to your cycling sessions and use a heart rate monitor or cycling compute to ensure that you are staying within your target heart rate zone some good ways to add resistance include 1 x research source riding up a hill riding into the wind changing to a larger gear familiarize yourself with uci rules the union cyclist internationale uci is the organization that runs most competitive bike races learn the rules for the type of event you want to complete before you start getting involved in races this will give you a better understanding of what is and is not acceptable in the competitive cycling world 2 x research source start as young as you can if possible join a high school or college team to get a leg up on the industry not only will this help you develop the skills and strength that you need to succeed but it will help you help get your name out there in the community you ll have the head start you need and friends in all the right places you ll have to start young in general though as the us has rules stipulating age for cyclists in some races cycle with others join a local cycling club and participate in weekly trainings this will help motivate you and also give you the opportunity to learn from others you can find local groups by searching internet forums checking with your local gym or looking through your local parks and recreation department have friends that cycle too the pro cycling life can get very lonely you ll have intense schedules and very little free time if you want to maintain a social life you ll want friends who are right there with you ride with people who are better than you you will feel the need to rise to the challenge the sense of competition helping to push you harder down the road 3 x research source find a coach to help you improve your times and technique sometimes you can find a good coach through your cycling club but you can also look through the classifieds in cycling magazines a good coach can help you break your own time records build your endurance and speed and improve your technique when racing against others an experienced coach can also give you advice about the best nutrition for endurance sports and advise you on the best equipment get the lay of the land analyze each race to see what you can improve on in terms of technique equipment or physical stamina look at the track and see what challenges you re going to have to face and what you need in order to deal with them you can also look at videos of racers that you know you ll be competing against if you can find them to see how they handle similar challenges take a page from the pro s book study professional cyclists to learn how they train and eat and what their techniques and racing strategies are you ll notice patterns in terms of how they approach a race and work with other cyclists in their teams adopt the techniques that work for you practice key skills key biking skills like descending and cornering can mean the difference between success and failure practice these key skills by taking routes that include these features when you practice 4 x research source select an event that you want to specialize in there are several different types of cycling events and finding your niche can help you to set yourself apart find a coach who can help you to develop your skills in your chosen event 5 x research source for example you could focus on time trials criteriums or stage races if you are a road racer you could specialize in downhill enduro or cross country if you are a mountain bike racer or if prefer to race on a track aka a velodrome then you might participate in sprint pursuit or scratch races ensure that you have a flexible job to support your cycling it is difficult to make money as a pro cyclist but some people manage to do so for a while pro teams usually only pay for equipment and travel even the payout for major races is actually pretty low choose a flexible job that will work with your training and race schedule teaching is a profession that may lend itself to cycling since you ll have summers off which is when most of the season takes place you might also consider working in a bike shop so that you can interact with other people who love the sport enter local races performing well at local events will help build your technique confidence and reputation if you re entering with other members of your local club be sure to work with them to dominate the racecourse look for local races by searching websites like active com or the official cycling website for your country find a sponsor though professional cyclists train extremely hard like all other professional sports the financial rewards associated with winning are much lower than those in professional baseball football basketball or ice hockey as such sponsorship is an important part of becoming a professional cyclist as the amount of cash available will determine the quality of equipment coaching and medical care you will have though sponsors usually don t donate as much cash in the amateur leagues as they do for professional cyclists having a sponsor can make a difference in covering the costs of equipment training and travel it s difficult to do but worth trying all the same enter in bigger contests as you become better and faster the more attention you get in amateur contests the more chance you stand of catching the eye of a scout for a

how to climb steep hills while cycling,climbing hills on a bicycle isn t everyone s idea of fun yet if you live in a hilly area or you re traveling through hills why deny yourself the pleasure of continuing to ride regularly just because of those steeper hills climbing steep hills on a cycle requires knowing a few tips about increasing your stamina positioning yourself correctly on the cycle and changing those gears so hop back on your bike with this advice and find yourself a few steep hills to practice on until it feels much easier,prepare yourself mentally if you ve cycled a hill before you ll already know that it hurts physically and takes a lot of effort if you ve long been the sort to hop off the bike and walk it up the hill you ll need a little mental prepping first accept that riding uphill is more effort once you stop fighting it mentally you can spend more time motivating your body and learning how to make the ride easier on you get excited about the challenge of making it to the top of the hill this is something that you re quite capable of doing and proving it to yourself can be a lot of fun in between the agony don t expect to go fast that s unrealistic and likely to wear you out before you ve hardly begun understand the benefits to your body of cycling on hilly terrain hilly terrain builds your fitness levels up by helping your body learn to use oxygen more efficiently also the process of climbing the hill on a bike uses different muscle groups as you shift about on the bike to maintain maximum power the climb allows you to work hard and the descent allows you to recover providing a perfect exercise workout per each hill 1 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 76 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 start the hill climb staying seated on the bike seat or saddle keep your weight back and hold the handlebars over the top and close to the center 2 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 76 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 your hands should be about 2 3 inches 5 7 5cm from the center stern to allow maximum breathing if your chest is open and shoulders back you ll be able to breath much more easily as you move up the hill crouch down this requires you to keep your body low and your elbows low but slightly pointed out to keep your chest open for easier breathing and to keep your upper body relaxed 3 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 76 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 toward the top of the hill stand up from the seat saddle at this point use all of your body weight to assist you in pushing down hard on the pedals standing up takes a lot more energy than sitting down so don t overuse this technique keep it till the last portion of the steep hill your hands should now sit on top of the brake levers shift your body in time with your legs keep your back straight and your chest open to aid good breathing 4 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 111 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 learn how to shift gear going uphill those gears are there to be used and uphill they will definitely assist you with extra power if you change them effectively however it takes practice to get used to how it feels to change gears as a method of changing the pace and power when climbing a hill so don t despair just keep practicing it shift the gears in anticipation of or just before each terrain gradient change not once you ve already reached each gradient keep pedaling while you change gears so as to maintain momentum 5 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 67 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 the aim is to keep your effort as constant as possible a low gear is needed for going uphill you ll need the higher gear for going back down keep practicing this technique won t be easy for the first few tries but it s important to persevere it is only in the doing that you will learn the feel for climbing the hill on the bike and learn the right timing for shifting your body weight on the bike to achieve the maximum power for the least effort start with shorter hills and gradually increase your trials to steeper ones try using low gear with a steep hill once you re feeling more confident with hill climbing on a bicycle learn the technique for climbing a hill economically this technique requires that you stay seated and use a low gear and don t rely on standing up for much of the time 6 x research source chris sidwells i 7 week cycling for fitness i p 83 2006 isbn 1 4053 1101 0 breathe regularly and deeply keep it slow and gradual in the early stages of the hill climb this isn t a race it s about economizing your energy usage select the low gear that will still allow for reasonably fast pedaling sit up and hold the outer edges of the handlebars this will ensure that your breathing is made easier by an open chest once the hill gets much harder and you notice you ve no lower gears left to use grip onto the brake hoods pull them to give you more power when pedaling only now use standing briefly if needed at this point you should intuitively know what feels best for you in the combination between standing and sitting in the bike for the most economic use of your energy stay focused on a steady rhythmical climb that makes the most of every turn of the wheels to pull you up this hill this kind of slower but powerful riding takes time to master but it s efficient and is good for longer rides such as when traveling through hilly country for long distances you are far less likely to tire out than using the method that requires standing to get you up the hills in turns take the long way on the outer side of the turn it may seem illogical but you ll lose less momentum that way have a rest at the top of the hill for a particularly strenuous hill climb a brief hilltop rest may be in order especially while training yourself to get used to it descend with care be alert for obstacles like cars pedestrians animals and objects on the road don t go down too quickly use both your brakes to pull back the speed and by sitting upright in your seat so that your body acts like an air brake 7 x

how to bike through sand,biking on sand is quite different from cycling on the road the ride is bumpy the steering is wobbly and your tires struggle to grip the loose surface fortunately the right adjustments and a bit of practice can almost make up for these effects get ready for a short read and a long glide across the beach,get a fat bike if you ride through sand often fat bikes have 4 in 10 cm tires on 26 in 66 cm rims they are the best choice for riding through sand so if you like to cruise around the beach or tackle sand dunes investing in a fat bike is a wise decision 1 x research source opt for wide tires wider tires allow more contact with the ground surface making balancing your bike easier for best results get tires between 1 75 to 2 50 in 4 4 to 6 4 cm wide loose sand requires even chunkier support 2 x research source your rim diameter limits your tire width options if you ride over sand often and your bike frame supports it consider switching to a wider tire using wide tires impairs performance on hard surfaces if you re riding a trail with mixed conditions you ll have to compromise use a lower tire pressure letting some air out of your tires can make riding through sand easier when more of your tire is in contact with the sand the bike will be less difficult to pedal and steer 3 x research source if you have a fat bike you can go as low as 4 6 psi 4 x research source for a mountain bike lower the psi to 18 20 5 x research source stick to low gears the lower gears produce more torque reducing the chance that your rear wheel gets stuck in sand this can feel frustrating in combination with thicker tires but you need this extra push to stay on the surface 6 x research source minimize shifting and braking in the sand shifting and braking will slow you down and dig your wheels into the sand killing your rhythm plan ahead and shift gears while you re still on solid ground 7 x research source you may shift when traveling down a sandy slope since you ll have enough speed to carry you make sure you re in a gear for easy pedaling once you hit flat ground aim to ride on wet sand or thin layers of sand over packed soil if you re new to riding through sand try to stay away from loose sand which will slow you down and make steering more difficult however riding on wet sand or a thin layer of sand over hard soil is similar to riding on slightly wet grass 8 x research source steep slopes are especially difficult stay away from them until you re more comfortable if cycling at the beach stay near the water but out of water range you ll have more room to maneuver at low tide lean back slightly resist your urge to lean over the front wheel this will dig it into the sand slowing you down or disrupting your course instead sit back in the saddle and keep your weight centered over the rear of the bike 9 x research source while riding on dunes you can even pull up a little on the handlebars pedal with consistent force don t pedal in short uneven bursts or the change in speed may cause your rear wheel to slip and dig into the sand find a cadence that works for you and stick to it until the slope changes 10 x research source ride slower than you normally would especially as a beginner it s easy to lose control over sand and you don t want to go flying over the handlebars if you re on hard ground and see a small patch of sand coming up gathering speed may help you pass through it don t forget to take your weight off the front wheel as you approach change direction using counter pressure you won t be able to steer your bike the same way you normally would on a paved or dirt surface when riding in the sand gradually lean your body and use counter pressure to turn your bike if you quickly turn your tire it will dig into the sand 11 x research source relax loose sand makes for a bumpy wiggly ride keep your body loose to absorb the shock and stay in control use a light touch on the handlebars as well 12 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to avoid lower back pain while cycling,cycling is a great cardiovascular activity that s generally easy on the joints because it s not weight bearing although back pain seems to be relatively common among cyclists according to research about 68 of people who cycle frequently experience debilitating back pain related to cycling at some point in their lives 1 x research source back pain from cycling has a number of causes mainly unsuitable bike dimensions poor posture and weak and inflexible back and other core muscles learning about proper bike dimensions as well as specific back exercises and stretches should allow you to avoid back pain from cycling,buy the appropriate size of bike it should be obvious that an improperly sized bike can lead to back pain or other physical issues but many people select a new bike based on price point and tend to downplay the importance of the bike s dimensions and ergonomics ideally a bike should be customized to your body but that can get pretty expensive a more economically friendly alternative is buying a bike from an actual cycle store not a big department store and asking the salesperson about proper sizing once you ve narrowed down the style of bike and the size of the frame ask to take the bike on an extended test drive at least 30 minutes and see how your back responds to it 2 x research source choosing a bike that is too big will cause you to hunch over too far when reaching for the handlebars which can eventually lead to back pain for those with low back conditions a reclining bike also called a recumbent bike may be the best bet 3 x research source make sure the saddle is the right height although the bike s frame height is important especially for being able to dismount safely the height of your saddle is even more paramount saddle height is determined by how long your legs are and should be positioned so that when the pedal is at the bottom of the stroke nearest the ground your knee should have a slight bend in it between 15 20 degrees of flex ideally 4 x research source your hips and buttocks shouldn t move sideways while peddling and you shouldn t have to stretch your legs at the bottom of each pedal stroke stretching too far with your legs puts strain on your low back adjusting the saddle angle is also important positioning it horizontal parallel to the ground suits most people although people with chronic back conditions or sensitive perineum areas may feel more comfortable with the saddle tilting somewhat forward adjust the handlebar height and angle the bike s handlebars should be adjusted to a height at which you can comfortably reach them from an upright position while having your elbows slightly bent this is usually a personal preference but the handlebar height is often even with or up to 4 inches 10 cm below the saddle height depending on back muscle flexibility 5 x research source the angle of the handlebars is not adjustable on many low to mid range bikes but if yours is try different settings and see how your back responds increasing the angle acts to raise the handlebars and bring them closer to your body allowing you a more upright posture which may be helpful for preventing back strain novice and occasional cyclists should keep their handlebars at the same height as their saddle seasoned cyclists generally keep their handlebars a few inches below their saddle height to be more aerodynamic and faster but it requires decent flexibility within the muscles of their backs get a bike with suspension almost all modern bikes at least mountain bikes have some sort of suspension or shock absorbing accessories shock absorption is very important for the well being of your spine especially if you mountain bike on rough terrain and are getting frequently jarred 6 x research source the smoother your ride is the less musculoskeletal pain you re likely to develop get a bike with front shocks at the very least but consider bikes with full suspension somewhere underneath the seat if preventing back pain is important to you other forms of shock absorption on a bike include thick knobby tires heavily padded saddles and cushioned biking shorts most suspension accessories are adjustable so ask a qualified salesperson for assistance if you need to road racing bikes tend to be especially light and rigid but don t come with suspension avoid slouching or hunching your shoulders while riding your posture while cycling is also crucial if you want to avoid back pain try to keep your back straight while cycling not completely erect like sitting in a chair but rather flat stable and well supported by squared shoulders distribute some of your weight to your arms and hands while keeping your chest and head up 7 x research source shift positions and change the angle of your upper body periodically in order to prevent muscle fatigue gently lifting and lowering your head from time to time is helpful for keeping your neck loose and avoiding muscle strains approximately 45 of overuse injuries to professional road cyclists involve the low back 8 x research source keep your arms slightly bent while riding when riding your bike keep your arms slightly bent 10 degrees while gripping the handlebars this posture will allow the joints and muscles of your upper body to absorb some of the vibrations and impact instead of your spine particularly if you tend to ride on rough terrain such as forest or mountain paths 9 x research source grip the handlebar with your whole hand but not too tightly wear padded cycling gloves to help with shock absorption if your back tends to act up while cycling break your ride into segments and take more rest stops keep your leg at a 90 degree angle at the top of the stroke when peddling it s more efficient and best for your hips and low back to have your knee bend at a 90 degree angle at the top of the peddle stroke when it s farthest from the ground at 90 degrees your thigh should be roughly parallel to the saddle which then allows for a strong push down on the pedal at the bottom of the stroke when the peddle is closest to the ground your knee should be flexed at about 15 20 degrees which is unlikely to strain the low back muscles tendons and or ligaments 10 x research source braddom randall physical medicine amp rehabilitation 4th edition philadelphia elsevier saunders 2011 if your legs do not match these angles while you pedal then adjust the height of your saddle the front 1 3 of your foot should be in contact with the pedals while peddling strengthen your core muscle groups your core includes the muscles in your pelvis lower back hips and abdomen 11 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source having a strong core that works in harmony dramatically reduces the risk of back injuries and pain from exercise making sure your core muscle groups are relatively strong before you start cycling is a good strategy to reduce the risk of back pain cycling does not specifically strengthen the core body muscles although it can certainly strain them 12 x research source in contrast any exercise that utilizes the abdominal and back muscles in coordinated fashion is a good core exercise for example just trying to maintain your balance while sitting on a large exercise ball will work your core muscles do bridge exercises lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor keeping your spine in a neutral position and not tilting your hips while contracting your abdominal muscles raise your hips off the floor and hold the position for at least 30 seconds repeat five to 10 times daily this will also help strengthen your glutes try planks start on all fours with your hands flat on the floor directly beneath your shoulders extend your legs behind you so your hands and toes are bearing your body weight keep your back straight don t let is sag or round up and tighten your stomach hold for 30 seconds then release repeat two to three times gradually increasing the hold time of the exercise a great activity that will strengthen your core and prepare you for cycling is swimming strengthen your buttocks and legs cycling can obviously strengthen your legs but research has shown that if your legs are not strong enough before getting involved with cycling then you re at higher risk of back pain 13 x research source scientists have demonstrated that when cyclists pedal to exhaustion their hamstrings and calf muscles become progressively more fatigued which negatively impact their spinal posture and putting them at risk for back pain as such consider increasing the strength in your legs before you embark on cycling as a hobby strengthen you hamstrings by doing deep leg bends lunges and or hamstring curls at the gym two to three times weekly start with light weights and progress to heavier ones over the course of a few weeks consult with a personal trainer if you re unfamiliar with weight training strengthening your calves by grabbing some free weights at least 10 pounds in each hand and doing heel raises while on your tiptoes hold for five seconds and repeat 10 times on a daily basis progress to heavier weights over the course of a few weeks in addition to strengthening the legs one should also strengthen the glutes buttocks if the hamstrings and calves become too tight the glutes become weak this leads to more work being placed on the lower back weak glutes can also contribute to knee pain 14 x research source strengthen your buttocks glutes by doing a bridging exercise lie on your back with feet flat and knees bent slowly lift your back off the ground as high as you can so your thighs and back are aligned in a straight line hold this position for 20 seconds rest and repeat 3 to 4 times you can increase the hold position as you improve in strength 15 x research source keep your back limber with stretches the flip side of a strong back is a flexible back strong back muscles are important for generating power while peddling and absorbing the micro trauma of road shock and vibration but a flexible back is crucial for enduring the posture required of cycling without leading to strains a great activity that stretches the back and other core muscles is yoga the challenging body poses of yoga also act to strengthen your core and leg muscles and improve your overall posture 16 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source do leg to chest stretches lie down on a padded surface with your knees bent and feet together on the floor grab your shins and try to touch your thighs to your chest go as far as you can until you feel a stretch in your low back muscles and

how to ride a bicycle in traffic,cycling in traffic can feel dangerous but it can be fairly safe if you follow the rules make sure to obey traffic laws while riding and take steps to keep your full attention on the road in addition protect yourself with gear like helmets and reflective clothing so you don t end up hurt,try riding in parking lots first if you haven t ridden much in traffic parking lots are a good place to get some practice in you ll be riding around cars but at a much slower pace than you would be on the road 1 x research source work on pedaling between cars and stopping to let traffic pass you as needed make sure you are comfortable with your bike you should be capable of performing all the basic operations such as accelerating changing gears braking looking over your shoulder and signaling adjust things like the seat height and the brakes if you need to start off on the easy side streets when you decide to hit the road stick to side streets at first don t try heavy traffic before you are used to traveling with cars gradually build up your stamina on larger roads by traveling them during quieter times that way you can familiarize yourself with the streets and any obstacles for instance go through neighborhood streets instead of the main thoroughfares follow the flow of traffic while you may prefer to see the traffic coming toward you you must follow the rules of the road too in most areas you re required to ride the same direction as the traffic doing so helps other drivers predict where you ll be on the road making you safer 2 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source stay in the outside lane in the united states for instance you generally stay in the right hand lane at all times that way the cars on the road can more easily go around you and you won t slow up the flow of traffic as much 3 x research source you can move out of the lane when you need to for things like making a left hand turn passing a vehicle or going around an obstacle ride in a straight line if you weave in and out cars don t know what you re going to do next by riding in a straight line in the center of the lane you signal to the other drivers that your path is predictable 4 x research source unpredictability increases your chance of a crash because you re making drivers guess where you ll go next if they guess wrong you could end up in an accident pay attention to traffic lights and signs just like cars you have to stop at red lights and stop signs as well as yield to oncoming traffic at times following these rules is important because it gives drivers a sense of what you re going to do next 5 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source for instance if you come up to a 4 way stop with a car already there the driver expects you to stop since it was there first if you just run the stop sign you risk getting in an accident with the car use hand signals when changing lanes or turning since you don t have a turn signal on your bike you have to use hand signals to turn left put your left arm straight out to the left to turn right you can either put your right arm straight out or bend your left arm at the elbow with your hand pointing up 6 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source to show you want to stop bend your left arm at the elbow with your arm pointing down make eye contact with drivers before turning or changing lanes unless you actually make eye contact with a driver you can t be sure they see you if they don t see you they could turn or change lines and collide with you check to ensure they are looking into your eyes while you re signaling then you can move lanes or turn 7 x research source ride in bike lanes if they re available some roads will have lanes specifically for bikes and you should always use them if they are available otherwise ride on the main road in one of the primary lanes in most areas you have the right to use the road and cars must go around you 8 x research source avoid riding on the sidewalks as you can surprise drivers at intersections leading to accidents keep your eyes ahead of you you can t worry much about the traffic behind you because if you are constantly looking back you won t see what s ahead accidents happen most often when bicyclists cross paths with drivers at intersections if you keep your attention ahead of you you re more likely to prevent an accident 9 x research source avoid distractions while on your bike if you re distracted you may not notice a car coming in your path turn off the music and put your phone away while you re on your bike that way you can focus your whole attention on the drive 10 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source just like in a car don t try to text while cycling it could end badly similarly don t talk on the phone as that is a major distraction even if you have earbuds in give way to pedestrians just like when you re in a car pedestrians still have the right of way that s true whether you re riding in a bike lane on the street or on the sidewalk if you see a pedestrian trying to cross let them go first to avoid causing issues with traffic flow 11 x research source similarly if you re turning right you have to let pedestrians go by on the crosswalk before turning 12 x research source watch ahead for car doors this is particularly important if you re riding near parked cars a door could open at any point so be vigilant if possible put space between your bike and parked cars to keep you from running into one 13 x research source aim for about 3 feet 0 91 m of space between you and parked cars avoid weaving back and forth from the curb through parked cars as this creates problems with the traffic behind you be on the lookout for road hazards at all times if you hit a pothole it could throw you into the path of a car so always be looking ahead at the road other hazards can include things like toys debris and grates in the road 14 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source train tracks can also be hazardous for bikes ensure your bike fits you

how to commute by bicycle,after an initial investment of purchasing a bicycle you ll realize that biking is a very inexpensive mode of transportation you ll save money on gas and car maintenance you ll get in great shape and your coworkers will think you re awesome why not skip the traffic jam and walk into your workplace with an endorphin rush,find a safe and pleasant route don t just assume that the route you drive to work is the best route for biking often the best bike route includes back streets and side roads which may make your trip slightly longer but much safer and more enjoyable be realistic and honest with yourself are you really comfortable spending 20 minutes a day with the traffic from a freeway feeder whizzing by you at 60 mph 97 km h your local bike shop will probably have bicycle route maps get one and map out your route to work if there are no bike route maps get on your bike on a non work day and scout out the area consider incorporating streets with bicycle lanes when starting out dedicated bicycle lanes are great for beginners although more confident cyclists often consider riding on the road to be both faster and safer taking the lane is when the rider rides down the center of the lane so no car is tempted to squeeze past with questionable spacing be aware of other users on bike paths such as folks with strollers or dogs announce that you are passing on the left when overtaking someone on the bike path a cough or ringing your bell is a minimum if not a pleasant i m on your left do not sneak up behind someone overtaking them without warning them it is more courteous to announce your presence and well in advance you may find that your route to work in the morning is more highly trafficked in the afternoon and that you need different routes to and from work if necessary combine bicycling with public transit more and more transit systems are finding ways to accommodate bicyclists if yours isn t up to speed consider purchasing a folding bike to bring with you on a bus or train or using two bicycles one between home and your stop or station another for between the stop or station and your workplace do a test run of your bike route on a day with light traffic if you don t have a bike yet borrow one and make your test drive before purchasing one it ll give you a better idea of what kind of bike you ll need try some alternate routes if possible make a note of how long each route takes you avoid streets with excessive potholes or junk on the road avoid questionable neighborhoods where your safety might be at risk a public open space is always better than a hidden alleyway determine where you can lock your bike while you are at work ask your manager or supervisor maybe there s a closet or storage area where they ll let you leave your bike for the day otherwise find a street sign that does not pull out of the ground or a post to secure your bike onto with a good lock or more than one to further discourage theft if you lock to a traffic sign remember that it might be possible for a thief to unbolt the sign and then slide your bike up over the top the best thing to lock to is a complete loop of welded metal that is securely anchored into brick or concrete second choice would be a pole with welded cross members wider than the longest dimension of your lock acquire a bike find a local bicycle shop there knowledgeable people can help you decide what to buy see the choosing a commuter bike section below for more advice if you buy a cheap bike at a discount store have it fitted to you so you re comfortable if you buy an investment bicycle you may have a smoother ride but you will always be worried about someone stealing your bike what you buy will be for the same reasons you buy a cheap car

of your area this is essential to remain safe and within the law many places assign bicycles the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle most of the time riding on the sidewalk can not only increase your chances of running into something or someone but it can also earn you a traffic ticket even if stop signs are optional in your area you can never be sure how a car will react if they are at the intersection too register your bike if required learn how to make simple bicycle repairs before you hit the road a flat tire loose brake cable loose seat post or loose handlebar an unbalanced wheel or other minor adjustments may pop up while you re commuting be ready for them prepare and carry a lightweight bicycle specific toolkit include metric allen wrenches that fit your bike s bolts a screwdriver and or a multi use tool designed specifically for bike maintenance a pair of latex disposable gloves can come in very handy because it s hard to get the grease off your hands once you arrive at work a lightweight air pump or co2 cartridge inflation device tire levers and a tube patch kit do not add much weight but on site repairs can be time consuming a spare inner tube is nice but it s only single use without a patch kit a good compromise is to have a spare tube for on the spot repairs and then use the patch kit to repair your tube when you get to work so that you can then use your repaired tube as the spare for the commute home you may even want to invest in flat free tubes or tire liners puncture resistant tires work well if you plan to commute daily especially over gravel or where there may be broken glass they are worth the extra money take safety precautions while riding keep a reasonable distance between your bicycle and parked cars the most common accident for commuting cyclists is running into a suddenly opened car door don t make any sudden turns or weave in and out of traffic make your course steady so that drivers can anticipate your position use hand signals to indicate a turn or better yet invest in an electric turn signal or use the old courier method of physically inserting yourself in front of the car that may turn into you road users are legally obliged to make signals in most countries and even if you are not it is necessary for your safety to make sure that the people around you are aware of what you are about to do don t allow a tailgating car to bully you into squeezing into the side of the road when it s not safe it s better to slow down traffic than to put yourself in danger when there s enough room on the road for you to pull to the side safely do so and let the cars behind you pass exercise caution when riding in the rain metal surfaces are slick and your ability to stop isn t as good many cars not using their turn signals will turn a bit before stopping learn to look for this indicator the driver s movements can also offer clues to their next moves plan for hauling your things you will need something in which to carry your work items there are many types of bicycle luggage carriers backpacks or messenger bags might work but the lack of airflow against your body may generate more sweat in warmer climates look for a stabilizing strap around your waist or ribs to keep the bag from shifting while you pedal smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb d d9 commute by bicycle step 9 version

shirts can lead to big creases so if you need to look smart try rolling your clothes instead of folding them consider wearing riding clothes and safety gear during your commute often bicycles are not easily accommodated in cities and drivers are not used to sharing the road many people feel much safer with a cycle helmet a bike helmet will protect your head when you are mounting and dismounting common times for falls and it will make you more visible to motorists it will also offer some protection for your head if you have a crash when riding helmets are single use so throw yours away if it s done its job in a crash cracks or flaws are not always discernible to the eye and a new helmet is cheaper than a new head many people choose not to wear their work clothes when they re riding to work if the weather is unpredictable or hot see tips prepare an outfit specifically for rainy days generally what you wear depends on your budget and comfort but during bad weather it s important to be prepared stock up on ponchos rubber overshoes and waterproof gloves look for jackets with ventilating zippers under the arms grocery bags can waterproof a helmet in a snap as well as your seat if it has a porous cover waterproof socks or overshoes are useless unless you have pants to direct the rain over and away from the tops of the socks wool is more expensive and takes special care but it provides a wider range of comfort in the weather than other clothes even keeping you warm when wet don t wear anything that can get caught in the chain or wheels tuck your shoestrings into your right shoe and get a strap to wrap your long pants cuff around your right ankle so that nothing gets caught in your chain ring in humid areas use wicking polyester materials to keep sweat from fostering a skin fungus allow these clothes to dry fully rotating out two sets every other day wash them with mild detergent and dry on low heat hack your bike as needed some extras could make a huge difference in the quality of your ride consider installing fenders on your bicycle to prevent puddles from splashing onto your bike and your body the rat tail fenders that clamp onto your seat post are only minimally effective invest in a set of full fenders stainless steel though heavy is the best most durable solution next best is aluminum bonded to plastic polycarbonate fenders will also do the job but they are of significantly lower quality also be aware that some bicycles especially those designed for racing have very little clearance for installing fenders comfy seats are worth investing in on upright bikes but don t get one that s too big or they will get in the way and chafe seats with a recessed area down the middle reduce pressure on our sensitive areas more padding does not mean more comfortable if the saddle is too soft numbness can become a problem experiment and see which saddle is right for you stay away from gel padded seats they break down under exposure to the elements and create an impossible mess get a mirror you wouldn t drive a car without a rear view mirror would you you can find mirrors that fit on your handlebars your helmet even your glasses get at least one of these at some point you might end up having to ride in the dark as a precautionary measure install lights on your bicycle you don t want to be riding on the roads at night with standard reflectors and riding a bicycle without lights after dark is illegal in some countries install a white light on the front and red light on the back of your bike for after dark led technology is very advanced now offering great lights at easy prices look for units that use aaa or aa batteries which can be swapped out for rechargeable batteries lights with their own rechargeable batteries are more expensive and generally brighter these are for seeing where you are going if you have a nicer road bike and don t feel comfortable locking it outside consider the purchase of a full bike bag which will allow you to roll your bike wheels and all into the bag and carry it inside the bags weigh only about 5 pounds and can be carried quite easily in a backpack if your building has security guards consider a nice holiday bribe they ll call your bag the big laptop stick with it your legs and rear end might be sore for a few days or weeks don t give up you ll get used to the workout soon and you ll start noticing new muscles in your legs keep moving forward and enjoy the scenery don t get sold on buying a mountain bike just because there are a lot of them bike shops are accustomed to stocking bikes for recreation not for commuting and the features on mountain bikes don t really benefit you as a commuter unless you re the aggressive type and need a more sturdy steed swap out the knobbies for durable slicks in this case but don t bother with full suspension if most of your riding will presumably be done on pavement you re better off with a hybrid comfort touring road or singlespeed designed for riding on pavement you may also want to consider a recumbent bicycle ultimately the most important factors when choosing a bike are comfort and efficiency hybrids and comfort bikes are the same thing but have a wider version of the road bike wheel and tire hybrid or smooth version of the mountain bike sized wheel and tire comfort the hybrid is a bit more efficient where the comfort bike takes the bumps better both feature a very comfy and upright pedaling position good for taking the strain off your body touring bikes are beefier versions of road bikes but with more relaxed pedaling position though usually not as relaxed as comfort hybrid bikes converted road and track bikes are quite the rage in flatter areas with a single gear to maintain and no shifting to learn track bikes have a fixed gear so no rear brake is needed once you ve gotten the hang of these stripped down speed machines watch out for your knees though a fixed gear means the pedals are directly linked to the rear wheel eliminating the bike s ability to coast advanced fixer cyclists can ride a fixed gear bike in reverse by back pedaling a recumbent whose lower center of gravity also takes getting used to has a more powerful pedalling position which is infinitely more comfortable faster recumbent bikes have pedals higher than or level with the seat lower pedals indicate a more comfort oriented recumbent most recumbent bikes offer better aerodynamics than other bikes once you get up to speed as well as a seat back to add leverage against the pedals the lower point of view makes you wish you could see through cars sometimes and must be recognized longer recumbent wheelbases are more stable where shorter wheelbases are quicker and more maneuverable test rides are generally offered at good recumbent shops so take your time choosing and testing if you re looking to avoid the body pains of upright bikes carbon fiber bikes generally don t allow bolt on accessories such as panniers and kickstands this means that if you buy a carbon fiber bike you will most likely have to use a backpack which can be hot on a summer day also it may be more likely to fall over without a

mountain bike book i p 84 2002 isbn 1 55297 653 x choose chunky tires the wider the knobs on the tread the more mud will be dispatched before it has a chance to congeal on the tire good tires for mud riding include directional tires chevron pattern and semi slicks a smoother tire that allows the bike to cut through the slime on the surface to reach for harder ground beneath and slimmer tires 1 1 2 40mm can be good in mud spray the entire frame with lube for simple muddy conditions this can help to repel mud build up on the frame use a thick lube oil for the chain it needs to be thick to stay on in the face of the mud although it s more expensive chain wax is preferable as it won t hold the grit from the mud like lube will a heavy lubricant protectant dissolved in a lighter carrier such as a motorcycle chain lube or boeshield t 9 is easier to apply but still clings tightly 2 x research source keep tire pressure low about 35 40psi this allows the tire to mold itself better in the conditions change the brake pads before leaving or take a spare pair brake pads wear down to the pegs or housing when you re constantly descending muddy declines if it s wet the mud acts like sandpaper grinding away add mud guards to the down tube and front wheel to protect the front as best as possible make sure the gears are well cleaned before setting out mud can cause them to jump around otherwise 3 x research source if you are a serious mud rider make sure that your brake cables and gear cables are of high quality to allow for smooth shifts and braking when the mud is severe practice getting used to mud gradually mud riding takes some getting used to initially and it s important to realize that mud from one season may well be very different from mud that forms in another season so knowing your local conditions and the bike s responsiveness to changes is something that will grow with time and experience 4 x research source nicky crowther i the ultimate mountain bike

bike the more soaked the ground the more the bike is likely to sink in to the ground as you ride through the mud horse riding trails after rain are not the off road rider s friend avoid them as much as possible also avoid trails that are really boggy and clearly deep in mud traction is hardest on clay or chalk trails that are wet or have mud always take extreme care with corners tree roots on corners can cause you to slip right over when approaching corners be prepared stand up if a wheel spins use the brake sparingly when approaching corners 6 x research source the wetter the trail the more grip you ll have when there is a choice always opt for trail that you can see over trail covered in mud and or water grass parts of a trail can provide traction between mud however roots and rocks can make it very slippery and require experienced technique 7 x research source beware ditches of water especially as a beginner and don t accidentally ride into them many trails have ditches to ensure that the water runs down the sides of the trail rather than eroding the trail this is true for walking hiking biking skiing and horse riding trails in general these can be useful for grip and cleaning the bike on occasion be thoughtful sometimes the challenge is so great that it escapes your mind that yet another bike riding this trail is causing erosion and damage for the trail for future riders for other users and for the environment itself if the trail is in such a bad state that riding it will just result in leaving great gouges and ruts forgo the ride until the weather improves or find a trail that s less messed up learn some techniques for riding through mud begin your sprint far before your bicycle reaches the mud patch when approaching the mud patch stay loose in the saddle and prepare for slippage where possible keep closer to vegetation where the line on the trail will be less likely to be as muddy 8 x research source when faced with slippage at high speeds do not lean your bike one way or another or your tires will slip out and you will fall instead steer with your handlebars and steer with preciseness this will require a little leaning however it still gives your bike a centered balance as well as continued traction with your tires it is also a good idea to spread your weight over the bike but if you need to slide back on the saddle seat use the bar ends 9 x research source keep pressure on the pedals 10 x research source when approaching the exit of the mud begin a sprint you will feel the connection of your tires with the hard dirt and then pick up speed lean back a little bit when going downhill to place your weight further over the back wheel 11 x research source your rear tire will bite more and your front tire doesn t really need all that weight on it anyway don t do anything drastic your goal is to maintain speed not increase it or change your line always select the right gear before climbing or descending with the descent control your speed before reaching deep mud or you might find yourself being flung off as you reach the mud 12 x research source enjoy it and don t be fastidious a lot of riders love mud because it tests the rider s skills and technique to their limits and well they love getting dirty after you ve spent time getting used to the feel and learning how to keep your pace going even though the mud s in the way

how to ride a bicycle in jakarta,want to ride a bicycle in car and motorcycle gridlocked indonesia if you know how when and where to go about it you ll give yourself a good workout and avoid wasted time sitting in traffic this article assumes you know the basics of bicycle riding already commuter cycling in jakarta is not for beginners,choose between a folding bike or a lighter bike some cross city commuters have taken to buying folding bikes which can be taken aboard the transjakarta busway shuttle they ride it from their house to the busway and from the busway to their office others who do not have to commute so far prefer light non folding bikes that can be carried up highway crosswalks without much effort even if you can afford a really expensive and fancy bike don t get one get a bike that s reasonably priced don t provoke thieves unnecessarily find out whether your company provides any parking for bicycles as in many developing countries the bicycle ranks low on the totem pole and it is the odd person read eccentric who chooses a bicycle as a commuter if that person has the means to get a motorized vehicle that said you may have to train your company s security personnel to provide you with a sheltered and secure bike parking stowage area buy bike locks for both front and back wheels locks that can be extended to anchor against something immovable if you have a fancy seat and seat post buy a lock for that too jakarta is after all a big city know which lever corresponds to which brake on your bicycle american market bicycles have rear brakes connected to the right hand lever while japan and china and indonesian bikes connect to the left this is important information if you do not want to be thrown off your bike in a panic stop accessorize properly contrary to the common conception of accessories being optional there are accessories that are absolutely necessary if you re going to bike buy lights head lights and tail lights pack lights do not depend on the dynamo driven front lights if you have them add battery powered led lights the visibility sets you out to drivers as different from the run of the mill cyclist and this awareness of you could save your life take care not to obstruct your taillight when stowing your backpack on the passenger carrier buy a bike bell or any sound device a clear ringing bike bell it could save you from some very minor crashes in the back streets and may alert many pedestrians and to overtake a cart or rickshaw have goggles or polarized clip ons you don t have to wear them all the time but they are particularly useful in certain seasons of the year when traveling at dawn or dusk when there are lots of flying insects that could easily get in your eyes have a basket if possible and certainly a passenger rack seat in back two or three short strap down bungee cords as well a basket is a very useful utility tool the bungee cords will stow your backpack perfectly on the passenger rack panniers are nice but they are uncommon and expensive in jakarta dress differently it does not pay to dress plainly if you re going on a bike you want to stand out be different be visible and thus be treated differently hopefully deferentially it does not hurt to dress like a person who can very well afford a car but prefers to ride a bike this results in policemen and container truck drivers taking extra care around you bring a change of clothes depending on office circumstances you may or may not have showers in any case it feels better to have a fresh shirt at the office load your bicycle properly it is common for newbies to load the front basket heavily not realizing that this makes steering tricky and difficult it is better to place your goodies in a knapsack that you can strap down on the passenger seat behind you with the bungee cords in the rare instance that you have two heavy bags tie them like saddle bags to the far rear away from the path of your feet as you pedal using tying straws take care that they do not obstruct the spokes listen for road noises do not wear noise cancelling earbuds headphones as hearing comprises a large part of your road awareness it is easy to teach yourself to listen for the deep bass sound of container and cargo trucks but it is more difficult to train yourself to hear the sound of mini cargo trucks like the isuzu elf always defer to motorized traffic when riding in a pack with them pull over on the shoulder and stop let them pass and then proceed beware of motorcycle riders they are for the most part your biggest nemesis on the road as most are undisciplined and reckless always assume they will cut your path or charge ahead instead of slowing down let them pass when they are bunched together such as at a stoplight when a public transportation suddenly stops ahead of you and you are not certain of the traffic behind you stop rather than overtake it may be a nuisance but it is certainly better than bodily injury do not travel on a bicycle after or between rain squalls the road will be slick and it s not worth the risk always choose to travel when it is still light only travel at night or at dawn twilight when absolutely necessary be extra careful and deferential to motor vehicles when traveling at night smile and wave at the guards and regulars along your path it is common practice in indonesia for companies to hire blue guards to stop traffic to allow their employees to drive in and out of their company compounds knowing the guards makes it more likely that these guards will be aware of your presence on the road and be more considerate of stopping you cold unless absolutely necessary besides it makes for a great morning when your road friends greet you on your way to work listen for driver s alerts if you hear a vehicle honking behind you trying to overtake you pull aside immediately and decrease your speed and let the vehicle pass you many of jakarta s streets are quite narrow bicycle lanes in the city bicycle lanes are very rare so if there are no bicycle lanes on the street road ride your bike at the very left side of the street road too let other vehicles pass you signaling if you are turning right or left do not immediately turn check to see traffic coming up behind you if you are mid lane a series of head turns toward the direction you intend to go will serve to indicate you intentions but still do so slowly and carefully remember that the motorcycle guys are the most unpredictable,Sports-and-Fitness
how to start biking,getting into the habit of biking daily can be quite easy so long as you get the right equipment and don t get too ambitious at the beginning to start choose between a road or mountain bike based on the type of terrain that you ll be biking on then get a solid helmet and download a cycling app that will make it easy to track your distance and speed start off with a small goal of biking 1 5 mi 1 6 8 0 km per ride bike 2 4 times a week based on your level of comfort until you re able to bike for longer distances more regularly,get a mountain bike if you want to ride on unpaved surfaces mountain bikes aren t exclusively for mountains if you plan on regularly riding on dirt unpaved gravel or grass select a mountain bike to make your experience more comfortable mountain bikes are heavier and have strong frames which helps keep them from breaking or losing traction on rocky terrain or bumpy surfaces 1 x research source if you re going to be biking over long distances look for a bike with a clip for your water bottle mountain bikes can be kind of heavy and bulky if you plan on keeping it in your home keep the storage space in mind when looking at a bike a used mountain bike will usually cost 100 300 new mountain bikes tend to be at least 400 but you ll regularly see prices in the 1000 2000 range select a lightweight road bicycle if you ll be riding on paved roads if you re going to be doing most of your biking on streets or paved trails select a road bike road bikes are smaller than mountain bikes and have thinner wheels which makes it easier to get them up to a higher speed road bikes are also lighter which makes them easier to steer carry and maneuver 2 x research source if you live in an apartment and will ever have to bring your bike inside a road bike will be easier to store than a mountain bike used mountain and road bikes tend to be equally expensive expect to spend 100 300 on a used road bike a new road bike will cost 400 1000 racing bicycles are a type of road bike they tend to be extremely light and they re designed to go as fast as possible on paved surfaces they tend to be quite expensive and fragile though so don t pick a racing bike to start unless you re always going to be biking on smooth pavement with no obstacles get a folding bicycle if you re tight on space or live in an apartment if you live in a second or third floor apartment or you have no storage space whatsoever buy a folding bicycle folding bikes can be easily disassembled to make them smaller and they are extremely lightweight however they can t go very fast and they re awful at making it up hills this makes folding bikes an excellent option if your only purpose is to make short trips in a congested area 3 x research source folding bikes are usually a little cheaper than a mountain or road bike new folding bikes are usually 100 300 but they re even cheaper if you can find a used one buy a used bike if you re just starting out the cost differential between new and used bikes can be quite extreme you can get a solid used bike for 150 but a decent model that is brand new may cost you 500 1 000 since you re just starting out you may not know what your preferences are if you get a new bike and it turns out that it isn t right for you you ll be out quite a bit of money on the other hand selling a used bike and getting a different model isn t that big of a deal 4 x research source used bikes aren t necessarily worse than new bikes they just tend to not be as shiny and may not have a ton of features a used bike can ride just as well as a new bike though avoid a custom or fixed gear bike until you re used to biking regularly to save yourself some money and heartbreak wait until you know precisely what you re looking for before buying a custom or fixed gear bike fixed gear bikes don t have brakes and they can be quite difficult to get used to if you ve never controlled one custom bikes will come with features and components that you won t even notice unless you re a veteran rider 5 x research source custom bikes use specific buyer requested components to achieve a certain weight balance feel and frame structure this is unnecessary for someone that s just starting out go to a reputable bike shop and get a bike that feels right don t buy your bike online instead go to a local bike shop and ask to test ride some models that look interesting to you when taking a test ride make sure that the bike is comfortable and feels good in your hands your bike should be easy to maneuver and pedal once you ve found a bike that you like pay for it and enjoy your new ride 6 x research source while some high end bike shops don t sell used models almost every other bike shop sells used bikes don t worry if the bike squeaks when you ride it the shop will adjust the brakes and oil the chain for you before you walk off with it buy a bike with gears this will make it easier to control how fast you pedal almost all road and mountain bikes have gears the gears look like little knobs or switches on the handlebar that you can turn to change the track that the chain is on buy a new helmet that fits your head comfortably a helmet is mandatory if you want to ride a bike get a helmet with a hard shell that fits your head the helmet should be tight enough that it doesn t fall off while you re riding but loose enough that it doesn t hurt when you wear it for an extended period of time 7 x research source the difference in pricing between helmets is usually based on how aerodynamic or stylish it is unless you plan on racing in the future go ahead and grab a cheaper model feel free to spend a little for a fashionable helmet though select a comfortable pair of bike shorts if you re taking long rides all of the fancy bike clothing isn t mandatory for an amateur cyclist although it does serve a purpose if you are certain that biking is going to become a regular activity for you pick up a comfortable pair of bike shorts bike shorts are tighter and usually made of spandex or nylon they re designed to keep your thighs from chaffing and your pants from catching in the chain as you ride 8 x research source you can ride a bike while wearing regular pants if you d like sweatpants jeans and athletic shorts are all perfectly fine to bike in if you do find your pants getting caught in the chain regularly roll your left pant leg up to keep it raised about the gears purchase a cycling jersey if you want to stay dry while you ride bike jerseys are tight fitting nylon or spandex shirts they tend to be brightly colored so that you re highly visible when riding at night they re also highly absorbent and will soak up sweat as you ride to keep you dry get a comfortable bike jersey that fits well to stay dray and visible 9 x research source again specialized cycling clothing isn t required if you re a beginner you can easily ride in a t shirt tank top sweater or jacket if you re going to wear a regular shirt and bike at night throw on a reflective vest so that drivers and pedestrians can easily see you wear athletic shoes before moving up to cycling shoes cycling shoes have ridges that hook into the grooves of some bike pedals since you re probably starting out with standard pedals they aren t necessary wear a good pair of tennis or running shoes when starting out tie your laces tight and double knot your shoes to keep the laces from getting caught in the chain if they do get caught regularly you can tuck your laces into your shoes before you get on your bike 10 x research source the other purpose of cycling shoes is to make your energy transfer more efficient as you ride your goal when starting out should be to maintain a good posture and get in the habit of biking though if you only care about speed you re going to get frustrated when you start biking get an air pump to avoid making frequent trips to the gas station the air in bike tires naturally escapes over time even if you don t have a punctured tire and keep your air valve capped tight to avoid having to ride to the gas station every couple of weeks get an air pump to refill your bike s tires 11 x research source get a manual pump if you want to save money buy an electric or mechanical air pump if you want to make filling your tires easier download a cycling app to track your distance and speed instead of spending money on a fancy pedometer or gps system download an app to track how far and fast you bike bike computer strava and mapmyride are the most popular apps for bikers they ll track your speed route and monitor how often you ride this information is important when it comes to tracking your progress 12 x research source strava bike computer and mapmyride are all free you can download them from your phone s app store you can connect a bluetooth heart rate monitor to strava and bike computer if you d like adjust the saddle so that your knee is slightly bent as you pedal when your pedals are the closest to the ground your knee should be slightly bent to avoid putting stress on your tendons and hamstrings adjust your saddle by lifting the latch and pulling it out to the unlocked position then slide your seat up or down to adjust its height close the latch and press it tight to lock your seat in place 13 x research source develop a posture that s comfortable for you to maintain there is no proper stance for typical cycling but the straighter you can keep your spine the better when riding your bike keep the crest of the seat aligned with the center of your tailbone stay seated while pedaling and try to sit up straight while staying comfortable the more relaxed you are while you ride the more likely you are to bike for an extended period of time 14 x research source ride with your hands in the drops of the handles to steer and brake the drops of the handles refer to the loop where the handles dip down place both hands on the bottom of the handle to make steering and braking easier on a mountain bike there are no drops so place your hands where it s comfortable and easy to reach the brakes 15 x research source when you do brake use the back brake to make gradual stops if you need to make an emergency stop pull both brakes at the same time pulling the front brake as light as possible to avoid flipping over develop a pedaling cadence of 70 90 rpm to bike efficiently when biking your body is most efficient when it s pedaling a little over once per second to develop a good pedaling pattern turn the gears on the front of your bike until you can comfortably bike at a rate of 70 90 rotations per minute rpm this will require some trial and error so switch your gears around as you start to ride to determine what works best for you 16 x research source the gears control which track the chain hangs on which changes the amount of resistance that you experience as you pedal they re designed to make it easier to maintain your pace while biking up or down a hill on flat surfaces use them to adjust how fast you need to pedal almost all racing and mountain bikes have gears look down the road or trail as you re biking to avoid obstacles to avoid running into potholes rocks or obstructions look up while you re biking your first temptation may be to look down at your handlebar to focus on your body s motions but this can be dangerous keep your eyes 90 150 feet 27 46 m down the road or trail to avoid running into something 17 x research source it s fine if it s a little more comfortable for you to tilt your head down just make sure that you re looking up while you do this communicate with drivers by using hand signals on public roads to avoid startling drivers communicate when you plan to stop or turn to indicate that you are turning left extend your left arm straight away from your body for a right turn extend your left arm and bend your elbow at a 90 degree angle pointing up to indicate that you are stopping or slowing down extend your left arm with your elbow bent pointing down this way drivers will know when you are turning moving or stopping 18 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source hand signals are made with the left arm because the right hand controls the back brake this is the more important brake for cyclists since the front brake should never be pulled on its own if you are absolutely certain that you won t need to brake feel free to indicate right turns by extending your right arm out begin with a smaller goal of biking 1 5 mi 1 6 8 0 km per ride if you start out with a massive goal of biking 50 miles 80 km a week you ll struggle to reach your goal start out with a small achievable with a goal of 1 5 miles 1 6 8 0 km per ride you can always work your way up to longer rides over time starting small will ensure that you aren t discouraged by not reaching your objective it will also prevent injuries from the impact of long rides before your body is ready for it 19 x research source if you re really new to biking you can start even smaller choose a quiet 4 5 block route with little to no traffic practice riding that route perfectly before moving up to a longer more difficult ride track your distance during each session using a cycling app bike 2 4 times a week to give your body time to heal between rides after your first ride you re probably going to be quite sore overworking your body is a surefire way to discourage yourself from biking take days off between rides so that you re biking 2 4 times a week based on your level of comfort 20 x research source if you re starting to bike so that you can get to work or school every day start out by biking 2 3 times a week drive or take public transportation on the days that you re taking off work up to a full week over time make a habit of biking by tracking how often you ride it s hard to start a new habit if you don t have accountability in a journal write down how often you ride each day note the distance that you biked as well review your results at the end of the week to determine whether or not you ve reached your goal by tracking how often you actually bike you ll know for sure whether you re getting in the swing of regularly biking 21 x research source it will become easier to reach your goal over time as you get used to cycling and tracking your progress avoid routes that include hills or rough terrain until you re ready to ensure that you don t harm yourself stick with flat simple routes to start off minimize the number of turns that you need to take and stay away from hills or rocky roads it takes skill to navigate difficult routes until you have some experience you re better off playing it safe 22 x research source staying on flat roads with few obstructions allows you to get comfortable with the act of pedaling without needing to pay attention to your terrain find a biking group that takes scheduled rides together if you find it hard to get in the habit of biking regularly look into joining a cycling group cycling groups are a set of people that ride together on scheduled trips and having a set of people to bike with will keep you motivated go to your local bike shop and ask around for a group to ride with you can also search online for a beginner level bike group that s open to new members 23 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to prepare for a biking trip,biking should be fun but also safe it is essential to prepare both yourself and your bicycle prior to departing on a holiday or a short jaunt if you take note of the following tips and advice your trip should be safe comfortable and enjoyable,check that your bicycle is in good working condition check tyre pressure and condition ensure lights reflectors gears and brakes are in working order check steering for looseness and adjust if necessary spin your pedals they should spin freely if they do not look at the axles as they may be loose ensure your saddle and handlebars are at the correct height for you make sure the seat bolt is tight look closely at your helmet if there are any fractures visible discard it and invest in a new one never buy a second hand helmet the previous owner may have a crash wearing it and there may be undetected cracks and may not give you that vital protection if you have a crash choose your clothing carefully plenty of layers will give you the opportunity to adjust to different temperatures a rule of thumb is 3 layers a tight layer a fleece and an outer layer cotton is not recommended as it has high absorbency rate and if it gets wet it stays so for a long time in addition it will lose its ability to breathe when wet wear cycle shorts there are loose or lycra and are good to avoid discomfort on a long biking trip avoid wearing jeans or thick cotton wear gloves they will protect against chafing and blistering wear comfortable shoes trainers are usually enough for short biking trips but it is recommended to invest in special cycling shoes for longer trips,Sports-and-Fitness
how to drive a golf ball,whether you re new to golf haven t played in a while or just looking to straighten your game out a bit there are several steps to take in order to drive a golf ball well putting your tee shot in play is a combination of knowing your equipment how to stand mastering your swing and keeping a clear head these tactics will help you learn how to drive a golf ball properly and improve your game and with some practice on the course and the range you can turn those bogies into holes in one,choose a driver with the proper loft since the science of the sport and the equipment have progressed opt for a driver with 9 or 10 degrees of loft rather than an older 7 or 8 degree driver amateur players can optimize the carry of the ball by selecting a driver with 1 3 more degrees of loft than tour pros 1 x research source a higher lofted driver will give you more carry which can help you stay more consistent in your shots the launch angle determined by the loft on the club head striking the ball the speed that the ball comes off the club face determined by club head speed as it strikes the golf ball and the spin of the golf ball determined by the prior 2 factors as well as some other factors including the grooves on the club face whether any grass got in between the club face and the ball at impact etc allow the ball to remain in the air carry pick the right club while you mostly use a driver off the tee for a par 4 or par 5 you have options of another wood or iron you won t always use a driver when driving a golf ball some holes will be set up so that you have to use a 3 5 or even 7 wood or one of your irons say if you are on a par 3 account for the design of hole you are playing as well as your own game when choosing a club for instance if you hit your 3 wood farther than your driver and think you could use an 8 iron to the green after hitting the ball with the 3 wood you may want to select the 3 wood to take your first shot if you do well with the 8 iron you can use your swing speed to help determine which club you need off a tee shot say you hit your 7 iron 150 yards your swing speed is most likely around 95 104 mph an 8 or 9 iron will be around 105 115 mph 2 x research source irons have a higher loft than woods and in the case of a par 3 hole you ll be aiming directly for the green which means you want more carry and less roll if the green is less than 200 yards 183 m away you re going to want to use an iron know what kind of ball you re using picking the right golf ball for your game can be a bit of a headache you have to factor spin hardness distance and most importantly feel unfortunately there s no golden ball that has all the answers for you the best way to determine the right ball for you is to go to your local golf shop and talk to a professional about what you want in your shot they can work with you to determine your club head speed and help you choose golf balls with the correct thickness of the cover and density of the core for your golfing style hit a few balls and rely on how they feel golf is one the most mental games out there and feeling comfortable in what you re hitting can greatly affect your shot note that professional rules prohibit you from using different types of balls during the same round however if you are playing with friends bring several types of balls and experiment to find which works the best for you pick the right tee nowadays everything in golf has multiple options to choose from including the tee you use with a lot of modern drivers having large heads the need to make taller tees arose resulting in tees of varying lengths when you take a shot the golf ball should be teed up high enough that the top of the driver club face dissects the equator of the golf ball to avoid hitting the ground before hitting a teed up golf ball use a taller tee similarly if you re on a long par 4 or par 5 and need to crush the ball to hit the green within par a taller tee for your driver is usually the way to go however a taller tee isn t always the best option when using an iron as you could tee the ball too high and cut under the ball when using an iron tee up the ball so it appears to be resting on top of the grass only the bottom 1 4 to 1 10 inch 0 64 to 0 25 cm of the ball needs to be above the ground align your body with a vertical marker in the distance pick a vertical marker like a tree or a standing person directly past the horizontal point where you want the ball the land it s better to use a vertical marker than a horizontal one once you find your marker align your body to set up to that target you can draw an invisible line from the marker to a spot a few yards in front of the golf ball to help you align yourself if you have a tendency to bend your left arm early that will hinder distance keep your v as long as possible before it bends at the finish of your swing and you will find yourself getting much more distance for a lot of golfers it s easy to pick some sort of marker that s inline with where you want the place the ball on the fairway you ll know roughly how far you re going to hit the ball so pick a spot and then look for a tree or something past your target to aim for as an object is easier to aim for than a spot on the ground set your feet in the proper position because a golf swing has both a horizontal and vertical feature the center of your swing will be a couple inches on the target side of your sternum position the ball inline with the heel of your front foot or where the pocket or logo is on your shirt if you re a righty 3 x research source avoid positioning the ball toward the front of your stance as this can make it more difficult to make good contact and hit the ball before the ground positioning the ball toward the front of your stance can also exacerbate problems with slicing or fading position your feet about 1 5 ft 0 46 m apart if you re using an iron or 2 ft 0 61 m apart for a driver adjust your arms you want your arms to be straight and form a v shape when you set up your stance for a drive think of your body as making a reverse k grip the club so the front edge of it is flat on the ground put your hands 2 5 3 hand widths in front of the inside of your front thigh with your arms in place for your swing you should stand about 8 inches 20 cm from the butt of your grip at address 4 x research source use the proper grip pressure even though you may think that gripping harder and swinging harder produces better results that is isn t the case a grip that s too hard can hinder your ability to achieve consistent distance instructing legend phil galvano first introduced the idea that you will find that the great players indicated that the grip pressure should resemble holding a bird without crushing it but also not letting it go the tighter you hold the club the less it will release throughout the ball your hands should be free of tension try different grip strengths at the range and watch for the results notice when your club doesn t connect well because you grip too loose or you skull the ball because you re gripping too tightly if you re a righty you want to grip the club with your left hand where your fingers meet the palm of your hand if you re a lefty do the same with your right hand curl your fingers around the club and then without moving the grip roll your hand over so your thumb is on the on the top of the grip do the same with your other hand right hand if you re a righty and left if you re a lefty position the club between your fingers and palm and place your pinky on the knuckle between your index and middle fingers you can also interlock them if you prefer roll your thumb over the thumb on your other hand know what kind of swing you re using you should have two swings one for power and one for control 5 x research source not every hole is going to allow you to crush the ball as far as you can some holes may have a water hazard cutting through it or dogleg to the right or left so you have to be able to control the distance of your shot as well for a power swing you want to position your head and the shaft slightly back behind your ball with a slightly wider stance for a control shot narrow your stance slightly position the ball slightly further back in your stance and choke down on the club a bit start your backswing 6 x research source your driver swing can be the difference between birdie and bogey when you go for your backswing you should shift your weight backward this will give your swing more power a lot of times your instinct might be to have a fast backswing thinking that it will give you more power to crush the ball this is a trap as swinging too fast will take you out of alignment stay flat your driving wood should stay along the ground or just kissing the grass you don t want to drive it into the ground for at least the first 20 to 25 percent of your swing if your club is lifting up you will pop the ball up and not get that long smooth drive that you see the pros hit regularly take a steady backswing and pause at the top to reset before begin your downswing this doesn t mean stopping as that will throw off your momentum think of it as hovering slightly before going down keep the start of your downswing calm and unhurried this enables you to build up speed so that the golf club is still accelerating when it reaches the ball your downswing should be one single movement that utilizes your entire body at the same time but don t rush here as you ll go off plane if you do one very important factor on your downswing is to keep your head down and in place this all happens very quickly and you may be excited to see how far you ve hit the ball but moving your head will move your whole body and ruin your shot you may be tempted to try and help the ball up by raising your arms but keep your swing consistent and trust that your club will do the work keep the angle on your leading hand many amateurs tend to flip the hands forward in an effort to get the ball in the air which defeats the purpose of having good equipment and a proper setup the leading hand left hand for most players right hand for lefties should be angled down towards the ball on the downswing think of it like hitting the ball with the back of leading hand if your hand is flipping down on the downswing you may hit the ground before the ball or only hit the top of the ball keeping the angle starts the ball low and lets it climb on its own through your generated power finish the golf swing by following through the club should swing over your left shoulder for right handed golfers or your right shoulder for left handed golfers again don t be in a rush to look up and see where the ball went if you did this correctly the ball will travel where you want it to,Sports-and-Fitness
how to calculate your golf handicap,the golf handicap was introduced in 1911 to allow golfers of differing abilities to play together in a relatively evenly matched way knowing your handicap index will allow you to determine what your course handicap should be for the specific golf course on which you re playing when you and your golfing partner s have determined your specific course handicaps you can then tally your final scores in such a way that you can compare them fairly even if you play at different skill levels 1 x research source,find your adjusted gross score to calculate your handicap index you ll first need a minimum of five golf scores and no more than 20 2 x research source gather at least five scores 18 hole scores or ten 9 hole scores and use them to calculate your adjusted gross score to determine your adjusted gross score ags total up the number of strokes taken during a round then adjust for the maximum per hole scores determined by the usga s equitable stroke control guidelines most golf courses make the information on maximum per hole scores available to the general public check the course s website or inquire at the clubhouse for example if you took 8 strokes on a hole whose maximum per hole score is 5 you would count 5 strokes not 8 for that hole when adding up your total number of strokes for the game calculate your handicap differential once you have your ags use it to determine your handicap differential 3 x research source the equation for a handicap differential is the ags minus course rating multiplied by 113 and divided by the slope rating or ags course rating x 113 slope rating the course rating is the numerical value given by the ugsa to each set of tees on a course it approximates the number of strokes it should take a scratch golfer to complete the course most courses make this information available via the course website or at the clubhouse the slope rating shows the difficulty of a course for an average golfer and is calculated by comparing the course rating to the scores of bogey golfers most golf courses make the slope rating available to their guests again check their website or at the clubhouse for example say your ags is 85 the course rating is 69 3 and the slope rating is 117 you would have the equation ags course rating x 113 slope rating or 85 69 3 x 113 117 which results in a handicap differential of 15 2 calculate your handicap index the formula for your handicap index is the sum of your differentials divided by the number of differentials multiplied by 0 96 or sum of differentials number of differentials x 0 96 4 x research source the figure of 0 96 in the equation represents the bonus for excellence that the ugsa has figured into the handicap index determine the number of differentials to be used if you re using 5 6 scores use the lowest differential if you have scores from 7 8 rounds use the lowest two differentials if you have scores from 9 10 rounds use the lowest three differentials and so on you can use up to 20 scores for which you would use the 10 lowest differentials for more detail on how many differentials to use see the ugsa handicap differentials chart for example if you re using 8 scores you ll be using the lowest two differentials let s say your two lowest differentials are 10 and 11 to average them add them together and then divide the resulting number by 2 then multiply the result by 0 96 and drop any digits beyond the tenths place the equation would look like this 10 11 21 21 2 10 5 10 5 x 0 96 10 08 dropping the digit beyond the tenths place gives you a handicap index of 10 0 remember not to round up calculate your handicap index if you haven t already done so you ll need to calculate your handicap index in order to determine your course handicap see previous section 5 x research source your course handicap takes into account your ability and the course s difficulty in order to show you your handicap for that particular course or in other words how many strokes based on your handicap index you can deduct from your final score for this particular course find the slope rating of your course most golf courses make this information available to players at the club house 6 x research source look for the course s slope rating on the course website or ask an employee at the course s clubhouse calculate your course handicap once you have your handicap index and the course s slope rating you can total up your course handicap using the formula handicap index x slope rating 113 round to the nearest whole number 7 x research source you divide by 113 because it represents the standard slope rating established by the ugsa many courses offer conversion charts that allow you to skip the formula altogether when looking up your course handicap the ugsa also offers a comprehensive listing of course handicap conversion charts specific to the course you ll be playing on for example if you have a handicap index of 10 0 and a slope rating of 117 you would use the following equation 10 0 x 117 113 which results in a course handicap of 10 3 go to the range the more practice you have with your strokes the better your performance on the links will be make it a habit to frequent the range regularly and often use your practice at the range to perfect your stroke which will translate into better form when it counts check your equipment having ill fitting or over used equipment can have a noticeably negative impact on your game check that your equipment is still in good working order no disintegrating grips no worn down grooves etc if it isn t invest in replacements get your equipment properly fitted to you having equipment properly sized to your body can make a significant difference to the quality of your game 8 x research source challenge yourself challenging yourself will help keep your skills sharp and diversified play different courses don t get stuck only playing at your home course challenge yourself by playing on new and different courses that will help you practice a variety of skills play in less than ideal conditions if it s windy rainy or otherwise less than ideal outside don t stay home instead challenge yourself by playing in the more difficult conditions doing so will help you develop a broader more diverse range of skills that you can then use to your advantage when playing in comparatively easier conditions,Sports-and-Fitness

how to chip a golf ball a precise distance,a chip shot is the perfect thing to use when you re stuck in the sand or need to clear rough grass to get to the green this specialty shot will cause the golf ball to go 1 5 yards 0 91 4 57 m in the air before landing if you want your chip shots to go near the intended area on the green you ll need to learn how to properly execute the shot and practice using it to hit the ball varying distances if you follow the right technique and continue practicing you can improve your chip shot and control how far it goes,plant your feet on the ground with your toes facing the golf tee stand 1 2 ft 0 30 0 61 m away from the golf tee position your feet so that they are parallel with each other and square your shoulders hold the handle on your club firmly with both hands and angle the club out in front of you 1 x research source you should feel comfortable and natural bend forward slightly at the waist bend at your knees and waist and square your shoulders line up your waist and spine with the ball while you position your golf club behind the golf tee 2 x research source fight any urge you have to lean backward when chipping the ball because it often leads to wide shots or shots that get too much air 3 x research source bring the club up behind you bend your non dominant wrist and your back arm slightly at the elbow while you bring the club back keep your leading arm as straight as possible while you swing the club in the backward motion 4 x research source for chip shots you ll only need to bring the club back 1 5 2 ft 0 46 0 61 m don t bring the club too far back or you ll hit the ball too hard and the direction will be unpredictable swing the club forward and hit the ball swing the club in a slightly downward direction hit the ball before the club makes contact with the grass for a clean shot 5 x research source if done correctly the ball should jump up over whatever obstruction is in your way 6 x research source it s normal for the club to hit the grass after it hits the ball it may take several tries before you make contact with the ball use a 6 iron for low terrain chip shots if you need to chip the ball over low terrain a 6 iron is the best club to use a ball hit by a 6 iron will roll a lot after they land so you ll want your ball to land 10 30 yards 9 1 27 4 m away from the intended target 7 x research source if you try to chip shot with a 6 iron too close to the hole it may roll past the hole the amount that the ball rolls after it lands will depend on how hard you hit the ball use a 9 iron to get more air than a 6 iron if you have to go over a lot of rough grass a 9 iron is the best club to use a ball hit by a 9 iron will also roll a good distance after it lands aim your shot for the front of the green and let the ball roll towards the intended area 8 x research source a ball hit by a 9 iron will go 3 5 yd 2 7 4 6 m in the air use a sand wedge when the ball is stuck in the sand sand wedges are bigger clubs that give the golf ball more air than if you used a 9 or 6 iron in addition a ball hit by a sand wedge won t roll as much use a sand wedge if you re stuck in a bunker or need to make a chip shot that stops quickly 9 x research source when using a sand wedge aim the ball as close to the target as you can use more power to make your shot travel further bring your club back further during your backswing and swing harder to put more power into your chip shot hitting the ball hard will result in a far shot that will get a lot of air 10 x research source if you need to clear an obstruction that is 3 5 yd 2 7 4 6 m long use a longer backswing and put more power in your shot use less power if you don t need the ball to travel far if you need the ball to clear a smaller obstruction reduce the distance of your backswing and put less power into your forward swing less power in your swing will also reduce the amount that the ball rolls after landing 11 x research source if you need to clear an obstruction that is 1 2 yd 0 91 1 83 m long you may want to use less power and put less backswing on your shot practice putting the ball to get a feeling for the green the grain of the green will affect how and where your ball rolls practice hitting a couple of balls in the center of the putting green then work your way to the fringes of the course 12 x research source practice chipping balls in the sand make sure to get out of the way if someone is golfing behind you set up indicators 30 60 and 90 yd 27 55 and 82 m away find an area where you can set up cones or ribbons to indicate 30 60 and 90 yd 27 55 and 82 m set up the markers somewhere off the golfing green use these indicators to practice hitting balls a specific distance 13 x research source you can also set up a practice range in your backyard if you don t have access to a golf course try chipping to each marker practice hitting the ball to the 30 yd 27 m marker at first adjust the power and angle of your swing until you get the feeling for the 30 yd 27 m marker once you re confident move to the 60 yd 55 m marker and then finally the 90 yd 82 m marker 14 x research source with enough practice and repetition you ll

how to play urban golf,too broke to pay for green fees too far from a green tired of seeing golf courses being carved out of pristine earth and being watered by precious fast depleting resources or do you just want to have some fun in the city with your friends urban golf might be just the answer you re looking for it s a game of golf unrestricted by the usual rules of golf and able to be played anywhere that there s free space and not too many people about,know the rules the rules for urban golf aren t set in stone and you can modify golf rules as you wish the rules that do matter are the golden rules these are show respect don t play where it harms other people or their property if you re asked to move away by residents or police do so without being bothered don t spoil urban golf for everyone who is playing it fairly everybody sucks this is a game where anyone can join in and have fun it s not about competitiveness if it becomes about competitiveness for you you re playing the wrong golf don t be a control freak there is no leader no one person in charge who insists how the game is to be played all players have a say in the progress and outcome of the game and if you don t handle this so well again you re playing the wrong game get your supplies together you ll need a few basics some of which will fit neatly tucked into a day pack golf caddy or can be easily carried get a golf club any cheap big mart club or a club out of a friend s bag will do as long as it s fit for hitting the ball it s worthy of playing urban golf find a few balls racket balls or tennis balls are the most effective and traditional for urban golf it s not recommended to use real golf balls because they re hard and can break things if you are a better player there are off course golf balls that don t break windows or dent cars that are new to urban golf callaway makes a mediocre one but the best is an almost golf ball they fly true and out perform racket balls and tennis balls it s a good idea to mark each ball for each player so that every player knows which balls belong to which player have a few extras in case some end up down a drain pipe or somewhere else you can t retrieve them from it s a good idea to have at least three balls per player make or download a scorecard to keep scores either write down the scores as you go on a piece of paper or use a prepared score sheet each player is responsible for keeping a tally of his or her scores or ask a player good with numbers to keep the tally honesty is essential you re all friends and this is not a competition pack snacks and drinks when you get the munchies take a break and enjoy the snacks together get the players together keep the group small 10 players or less large groups become hard to manage slow down the progress of the game and can attract negative attention if things get too rowdy or out of hand of course this doesn t mean you can t have a few spectators carrying the clubs and snacks for you as long as everyone s having fun watching is fine too find a place to play this is where it can be interesting as the places to play can vary from a series of alleys and streets in an industrial section of town or on the green areas of a city park just be sure that the area is not too crowded when you want to play the tradition is to try to avoid most residential areas unless your play won t annoy residents industrial or business areas can be great on weekends when the workers aren t around and the place is deserted pick your target holes you re going to need to know what you re aiming for and this should be decided by all players the holes can be something as simple as just hitting the side of a garbage can tree rolling over a manhole or rolling under a car any round ball will roll a long way on pavement or asphalt it s going to take some getting used to space the areas far apart so that there is ample hitting space and it s reasonably difficult to get a hole in one the size of a standard city block works well as an idea for measurement choose any amount of holes that suits your needs around 9 target holes makes for an even and fun pace you can also pick spots as you go especially if you re keen to keep on the move rather than to remain in one area make sure everyone in your group is in agreement as to what the holes and course consist of before play commences commence play while there are no hard and fast rules there are some basic guidelines to put into action so that the play is enjoyable and action packed here are some suggestions and you re perfectly entitled to change any of them as long as you keep within the golden rules select the holes as suggested earlier aim for the target hole and hit the tennis ball toward it take turns in hitting the ball toward the target hole after the first tee off the player with the ball furthest away from the target hits next a successful hit for a large hole is where the ball hits the target or passes through under or in it the larger the hole the more accuracy required if it s easy to hit don t allow for near enough hits make sure they re exact for example hitting dumpsters trucks and storage sheds means actually hitting them not rolling close by a successful hit for a small or narrow hole is where the ball passes within a 3 foot 0 9 m radius or 1 club length of the small target hole for example fire hydrants manholes poles and mailboxes are harder to hit award points each normal stroke is one point and a ball has to travel a few feet to be called a stroke loss of the ball counts as a 3 point penalty resolve what to do about stuck and lost balls stuck and lost balls have the ability to slow down play and make things tedious the following suggestions will help keep the game flowing fast limit the search time for lost balls this will keep the game moving well if the ball ends up in a pothole or somewhere else challenging each player is allowed to move the ball one club length in any direction to make it easier to make the next hit the idea behind this is not to hold up the game replace a lost ball by a new ball in the place where the other ball went out of bounds finding the lost ball means that you can remove 1 5 points from your score if the ball lands anywhere that could cause damage the ball must be moved at least 3 club lengths away or more if needed to avoid harm perfect your shot remembering that the aim of the game is to have fun not be competitive and to revel in your inability there is one thing you can do to help yourself keep the game moving basically try to keep your ball low to the ground high flying balls are more easily lost and have poorly controlled trajectories that could hit something you don t want hit resulting in damage,Sports-and-Fitness
how to drive a golf ball,whether you re new to golf haven t played in a while or just looking to straighten your game out a bit there are several steps to take in order to drive a golf ball well putting your tee shot in play is a combination of knowing your equipment how to stand mastering your swing and keeping a clear head these tactics will help you learn how to drive a golf ball properly and improve your game and with some practice on the course and the range you can turn those bogies into holes in one,choose a driver with the proper loft since the science of the sport and the equipment have progressed opt for a driver with 9 or 10 degrees of loft rather than an older 7 or 8 degree driver amateur players can optimize the carry of the ball by selecting a driver with 1 3 more degrees of loft than tour pros 1 x research source a higher lofted driver will give you more carry which can help you stay more consistent in your shots the launch angle determined by the loft on the club head striking the ball the speed that the ball comes off the club face determined by club head speed as it strikes the golf ball and the spin of the golf ball determined by the prior 2 factors as well as some other factors including the grooves on the club face whether any grass got in between the club face and the ball at impact etc allow the ball to remain in the air carry pick the right club while you mostly use a driver off the tee for a par 4 or par 5 you have options of another wood or iron you won t always use a driver when driving a golf ball some holes will be set up so that you have to use a 3 5 or even 7 wood or one of your irons say if you are on a par 3 account for the design of hole you are playing as well as your own game when choosing a club for instance if you hit your 3 wood farther than your driver and think you could use an 8 iron to the green after hitting the ball with the 3 wood you may want to select the 3 wood to take your first shot if you do well with the 8 iron you can use your swing speed to help determine which club you need off a tee shot say you hit your 7 iron 150 yards your swing speed is most likely around 95 104 mph an 8 or 9 iron will be around 105 115 mph 2 x research source irons have a higher loft than woods and in the case of a par 3 hole you ll be aiming directly for the green which means you want more carry and less roll if the green is less than 200 yards 183 m away you re going to want to use an iron know what kind of ball you re using picking the right golf ball for your game can be a bit of a headache you have to factor spin hardness distance and most importantly feel unfortunately there s no golden ball that has all the answers for you the best way to determine the right ball for you is to go to your local golf shop and talk to a professional about what you want in your shot they can work with you to determine your club head speed and help you choose golf balls with the correct thickness of the cover and density of the core for your golfing style hit a few balls and rely on how they feel golf is one the most mental games out there and feeling comfortable in what you re hitting can greatly affect your shot note that professional rules prohibit you from using different types of balls during the same round however if you are playing with friends bring several types of balls and experiment to find which works the best for you pick the right tee nowadays everything in golf has multiple options to choose from including the tee you use with a lot of modern drivers having large heads the need to make taller tees arose resulting in tees of varying lengths when you take a shot the golf ball should be teed up high enough that the top of the driver club face dissects the equator of the golf ball to avoid hitting the ground before hitting a teed up golf ball use a taller tee similarly if you re on a long par 4 or par 5 and need to crush the ball to hit the green within par a taller tee for your driver is usually the way to go however a taller tee isn t always the best option when using an iron as you could tee the ball too high and cut under the ball when using an iron tee up the ball so it appears to be resting on top of the grass only the bottom 1 4 to 1 10 inch 0 64 to 0 25 cm of the ball needs to be above the ground align your body with a vertical marker in the distance pick a vertical marker like a tree or a standing person directly past the horizontal point where you want the ball the land it s better to use a vertical marker than a horizontal one once you find your marker align your body to set up to that target you can draw an invisible line from the marker to a spot a few yards in front of the golf ball to help you align yourself if you have a tendency to bend your left arm early that will hinder distance keep your v as long as possible before it bends at the finish of your swing and you will find yourself getting much more distance for a lot of golfers it s easy to pick some sort of marker that s inline with where you want the place the ball on the fairway you ll know roughly how far you re going to hit the ball so pick a spot and then look for a tree or something past your target to aim for as an object is easier to aim for than a spot on the ground set your feet in the proper position because a golf swing has both a horizontal and vertical feature the center of your swing will be a couple inches on the target side of your sternum position the ball inline with the heel of your front foot or where the pocket or logo is on your shirt if you re a righty 3 x research source avoid positioning the ball toward the front of your stance as this can make it more difficult to make good contact and hit the ball before the ground positioning the ball toward the front of your stance can also exacerbate problems with slicing or fading position your feet about 1 5 ft 0 46 m apart if you re using an iron or 2 ft 0 61 m apart for a driver adjust your arms you want your arms to be straight and form a v shape when you set up your stance for a drive think of your body as making a reverse k grip the club so the front edge of it is flat on the ground put your hands 2 5 3 hand widths in front of the inside of your front thigh with your arms in place for your swing you should stand about 8 inches 20 cm from the butt of your grip at address 4 x research source use the proper grip pressure even though you may think that gripping harder and swinging harder produces better results that is isn t the case a grip that s too hard can hinder your ability to achieve consistent distance instructing legend phil galvano first introduced the idea that you will find that the great players indicated that the grip pressure should resemble holding a bird without crushing it but also not letting it go the tighter you hold the club the less it will release throughout the ball your hands should be free of tension try different grip strengths at the range and watch for the results notice when your club doesn t connect well because you grip too loose or you skull the ball because you re gripping too tightly if you re a righty you want to grip the club with your left hand where your fingers meet the palm of your hand if you re a lefty do the same with your right hand curl your fingers around the club and then without moving the grip roll your hand over so your thumb is on the on the top of the grip do the same with your other hand right hand if you re a righty and left if you re a lefty position the club between your fingers and palm and place your pinky on the knuckle between your index and middle fingers you can also interlock them if you prefer roll your thumb over the thumb on your other hand know what kind of swing you re using you should have two swings one for power and one for control 5 x research source not every hole is going to allow you to crush the ball as far as you can some holes may have a water hazard cutting through it or dogleg to the right or left so you have to be able to control the distance of your shot as well for a power swing you want to position your head and the shaft slightly back behind your ball with a slightly wider stance for a control shot narrow your stance slightly position the ball slightly further back in your stance and choke down on the club a bit start your backswing 6 x research source your driver swing can be the difference between birdie and bogey when you go for your backswing you should shift your weight backward this will give your swing more power a lot of times your instinct might be to have a fast backswing thinking that it will give you more power to crush the ball this is a trap as swinging too fast will take you out of alignment stay flat your driving wood should stay along the ground or just kissing the grass you don t want to drive it into the ground for at least the first 20 to 25 percent of your swing if your club is lifting up you will pop the ball up and not get that long smooth drive that you see the pros hit regularly take a steady backswing and pause at the top to reset before begin your downswing this doesn t mean stopping as that will throw off your momentum think of it as hovering slightly before going down keep the start of your downswing calm and unhurried this enables you to build up speed so that the golf club is still accelerating when it reaches the ball your downswing should be one single movement that utilizes your entire body at the same time but don t rush here as you ll go off plane if you do one very important factor on your downswing is to keep your head down and in place this all happens very quickly and you may be excited to see how far you ve hit the ball but moving your head will move your whole body and ruin your shot you may be tempted to try and help the ball up by raising your arms but keep your swing consistent and trust that your club will do the work keep the angle on your leading hand many amateurs tend to flip the hands forward in an effort to get the ball in the air which defeats the purpose of having good equipment and a proper setup the leading hand left hand for most players right hand for lefties should be angled down towards the ball on the downswing think of it like hitting the ball with the back of leading hand if your hand is flipping down on the downswing you may hit the ground before the ball or only hit the top of the ball keeping the angle starts the ball low and lets it climb on its own through your generated power finish the golf swing by following through the club should swing over your left shoulder for right handed golfers or your right shoulder for left handed golfers again don t be in a rush to look up and see where the ball went if you did this correctly the ball will travel where you want it to,Sports-and-Fitness
how to read a golf scorecard,golf scorecards allow golfers to track their score as well as providing vital information about the course the total score is based upon strokes and handicaps and compared to the other players to determine a winner if you are tracking your own progress as a golfer scorecards can also be useful as a non competitive reference reading a scorecard can seem difficult with all the numbers and jargon but you ll find it easy once you learn what everything means,find the hole column which lists the holes from 1 to 18 typically the first thing on a golf scorecard is the list of holes golf courses vary between 9 hole courses and 18 hole courses some scorecards will have a map of the course with each hole on the map having its number next to it 1 x research source holes are typically played in order from 1 to 18 in some cases like when the course is especially busy players may start on the 10th and finish on the 9th hole players will start on the 10th hole and play from 10 to 18 after 18 players will then play from the 1st hole to the 9th hole to complete their round identify the front and back 9 sections that split the course into 2 halves full size or 18 hole courses are split into 2 9s or 2 9 hole sections holes 1 to 9 are known as the front 9 and holes 10 to 18 are known as the back 9 after the 9th and 18th hole sections of the scorecard you will see the words out and in respectively 2 x research source the 9th hole marks the end of the out section which means playing away from the clubhouse the 18th hole marks the end of the in section which means playing back toward the clubhouse note the color names on the side which indicate each hole s distance these colors represent the placement of the tee boxes on each hole the numbers beside the color and beneath each hole denote the distance of that hole each color has a different meaning 3 x research source black or gold tees are the furthest from the hole these tees are usually only played from by professionals or very high standard amateurs most courses do not have black or gold tees blue markers reflect the tee boxes for local competitions these tees are normally used by very good amateur players if a course doesn t have black or gold tees the blue tee boxes are the furthest from the hole white tees are the middle tees most often used by golfers with middle to high handicaps red tees are the shortest member s tees these tees are the closest to the fairway and make the course much shorter than the other tees green tees are used by junior golfers or beginners look for the handicap section which ranks the holes by difficulty most scorecards also have a column which notes the handicap or index of each hole these numbers range from 1 18 and note the difficulty of each hole index 1 is the hardest hole on the course and index 18 is the easiest 4 x research source some cards also have a section for women s handicap some holes may play differently for women and men and this is why some courses have separate sections the handicap of each hole rarely overlaps with a player s handicap match play is one area of golf where both handicap s are relevant in match play players play each other in 1 vs 1 situations if player a has a handicap of 2 and player b has a handicap of 7 the difference is 5 player b will then be allowed an extra shot on the 5 hardest holes or the 5 holes with the lowest index if player a gets a 4 on one of these 5 holes and player b gets a 5 they tie because of player b s handicap spot the par information which states how many shots you should take par means the expected number of strokes on a hole for example you should take 4 shots on a par 4 and 3 shots on a par 3 you can find the par information in the par row on the scorecard 5 x research source the average golf course is a par 72 which means that the pars of all the holes added together equals 72 par generally relates to length par 3s are the shortest holes on golf courses and par 5s are the longest holes the most common par on a course is a par 4 if you look at the out and in columns on the scorecard you will see the par for each set of 9 holes a par 72 golf course will usually have 2 9 holes that are both par 36 write down the initials of everyone in your group you should never play with more than 3 other players during a round of golf there will be spaces along the left side of the card for each player s name 6 x research source some scorecards might only give you room for an initial note the score each player gets on each hole write down the number of strokes each player took and not the number of shots they took versus par if you played the 1st hole a par 4 and got a 5 then write 5 in the box next to your name and below the 1st hole s column 7 x research source when there s a hole in 1 some players will mark it by writing a 1 with a circle around it to draw attention to it if you make a mistake cross out the wrong number and write the correct score next to it sign your initials next to the corrected score to show it was you who corrected it and not somebody else trying to cheat calculate everyone s total at the end of the round the easiest way to do this is by adding 9 holes at a time add your score for the first 9 holes and mark your total in the relevant box in the out column then do the same for the second 9 holes and mark your total in the in column then to find your total shots for the 18 holes add the in and out together 8 x research source if the course is a par 72 and you took 80 shots you were 8 over par if the course is a par 70 and you took 65 shots you were 5 under par mark each golfer s score versus par in the total column once you ve calculated exactly how many shots each player took find the difference between each player s total and the par of the course 9 x research source if you took 77 shots on a par 72 you were 5 over par mark 5 in your section of the total column if your friend took 68 shots on a par 72 they finished 4 under par mark 4 in their section of the total column even par taking exactly the amount of shots you should can be marked with a 0 or an e handicaps make things a little more tricky if you have a 15 handicap and it takes you 85 shots to play a par 72 take 15 from 85 this leaves you with 70 shots on a par 72 or 2 under par a player with a 3 handicap will take 3 from their total if they take 72 shots on a par 72 course they take 3 from 72 to give them 69 meaning they ve shot 3 under par with their handicap your handicap is essentially an allowance to help you better players have lower handicaps and less skilled players have higher handicaps sign the scorer and marker sections at the end of the card this is especially important if you re playing a competition if you fail to mark your card you will be disqualified from the competition if you have marked the card sign your name in the marker section if someone else marked the card write your name in the scorer section of the card 10 x research source this step isn t very important in a casual round but it s good to get used to marking a scorecard properly,Sports-and-Fitness
how to calculate your golf handicap,the golf handicap was introduced in 1911 to allow golfers of differing abilities to play together in a relatively evenly matched way knowing your handicap index will allow you to determine what your course handicap should be for the specific golf course on which you re playing when you and your golfing partner s have determined your specific course handicaps you can then tally your final scores in such a way that you can compare them fairly even if you play at different skill levels 1 x research source,find your adjusted gross score to calculate your handicap index you ll first need a minimum of five golf scores and no more than 20 2 x research source gather at least five scores 18 hole scores or ten 9 hole scores and use them to calculate your adjusted gross score to determine your adjusted gross score ags total up the number of strokes taken during a round then adjust for the maximum per hole scores determined by the usga s equitable stroke control guidelines most golf courses make the information on maximum per hole scores available to the general public check the course s website or inquire at the clubhouse for example if you took 8 strokes on a hole whose maximum per hole score is 5 you would count 5 strokes not 8 for that hole when adding up your total number of strokes for the game calculate your handicap differential once you have your ags use it to determine your handicap differential 3 x research source the equation for a handicap differential is the ags minus course rating multiplied by 113 and divided by the slope rating or ags course rating x 113 slope rating the course rating is the numerical value given by the ugsa to each set of tees on a course it approximates the number of strokes it should take a scratch golfer to complete the course most courses make this information available via the course website or at the clubhouse the slope rating shows the difficulty of a course for an average golfer and is calculated by comparing the course rating to the scores of bogey golfers most golf courses make the slope rating available to their guests again check their website or at the clubhouse for example say your ags is 85 the course rating is 69 3 and the slope rating is 117 you would have the equation ags course rating x 113 slope rating or 85 69 3 x 113 117 which results in a handicap differential of 15 2 calculate your handicap index the formula for your handicap index is the sum of your differentials divided by the number of differentials multiplied by 0 96 or sum of differentials number of differentials x 0 96 4 x research source the figure of 0 96 in the equation represents the bonus for excellence that the ugsa has figured into the handicap index determine the number of differentials to be used if you re using 5 6 scores use the lowest differential if you have scores from 7 8 rounds use the lowest two differentials if you have scores from 9 10 rounds use the lowest three differentials and so on you can use up to 20 scores for which you would use the 10 lowest differentials for more detail on how many differentials to use see the ugsa handicap differentials chart for example if you re using 8 scores you ll be using the lowest two differentials let s say your two lowest differentials are 10 and 11 to average them add them together and then divide the resulting number by 2 then multiply the result by 0 96 and drop any digits beyond the tenths place the equation would look like this 10 11 21 21 2 10 5 10 5 x 0 96 10 08 dropping the digit beyond the tenths place gives you a handicap index of 10 0 remember not to round up calculate your handicap index if you haven t already done so you ll need to calculate your handicap index in order to determine your course handicap see previous section 5 x research source your course handicap takes into account your ability and the course s difficulty in order to show you your handicap for that particular course or in other words how many strokes based on your handicap index you can deduct from your final score for this particular course find the slope rating of your course most golf courses make this information available to players at the club house 6 x research source look for the course s slope rating on the course website or ask an employee at the course s clubhouse calculate your course handicap once you have your handicap index and the course s slope rating you can total up your course handicap using the formula handicap index x slope rating 113 round to the nearest whole number 7 x research source you divide by 113 because it represents the standard slope rating established by the ugsa many courses offer conversion charts that allow you to skip the formula altogether when looking up your course handicap the ugsa also offers a comprehensive listing of course handicap conversion charts specific to the course you ll be playing on for example if you have a handicap index of 10 0 and a slope rating of 117 you would use the following equation 10 0 x 117 113 which results in a course handicap of 10 3 go to the range the more practice you have with your strokes the better your performance on the links will be make it a habit to frequent the range regularly and often use your practice at the range to perfect your stroke which will translate into better form when it counts check your equipment having ill fitting or over used equipment can have a noticeably negative impact on your game check that your equipment is still in good working order no disintegrating grips no worn down grooves etc if it isn t invest in replacements get your equipment properly fitted to you having equipment properly sized to your body can make a significant difference to the quality of your game 8 x research source challenge yourself challenging yourself will help keep your skills sharp and diversified play different courses don t get stuck only playing at your home course challenge yourself by playing on new and different courses that will help you practice a variety of skills play in less than ideal conditions if it s windy rainy or otherwise less than ideal outside don t stay home instead challenge yourself by playing in the more difficult conditions doing so will help you develop a broader more diverse range of skills that you can then use to your advantage when playing in comparatively easier conditions,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play golf,playing golf is a fun relaxing hobby for many people and a competitive sport for some others when learning to play golf you ll want to start by learning some basic rules and the technique for swinging a club to hit the ball it s also helpful to know how to obtain equipment and to learn some proper golf course etiquette so you can safely have fun with anyone you play with,learn the object of the game in golf the object of the game is to get your ball from the starting point or tee to the green and into the hole the hole is marked by a flag and you want to get your ball in it with as few shots as possible hole is not only the physical hole but also refers to the entire area from the tee to the green where the physical hole is 1 x research source a standard golf course has 18 holes or areas with a tee green and physical hole marked by a flag there are smaller courses as well such as 9 hole courses which are ideal for beginners play the course by the order of holes every golf course is different in terms of how it is structured and which hole you start and end with every hole has a tee off area where you start and a physical hole where you finish it s a good idea to carry a course map with you on the course or to go with a group that has at least 1 person who s familiar with the order of the course find a course map at the course s main office where you check in and can rent gear take your turn in your group to avoid confusion and having everyone hit the ball at once you should know when your turn is usually the person with the best score from the previous hole tees off first with the next best score going next and the worst or highest score going last 2 x research source after the tee off at each hole the person who is farthest away from the hole hits first then the person who is next farthest away and so on until everyone gets the ball to the hole don t move your ball on the course if your ball lands in an unexpected place which it will when you re a beginner it s against the rules to pick it up and move it you have to play it where it is unless it s blocked by a man made obstruction like a yardage marker or a beer can 3 x research source if you re not sure that something near your ball qualifies as an obstruction ask a more experienced player if you hit your ball out of bounds or into water you will have to take a 1 stroke penalty drop your ball again where you shot it and try again keep score for each hole each hole on a golf course has an ideal number of strokes it should take to get the ball into the physical hole which is known as the par each time you hit the ball counts as a 1 toward your score pars range from 3 5 and each hole on a course will be called a par 3 par 4 or par 5 your score on each hole has a nickname relating to the par for that hole for instance shooting 2 under par or getting the ball in the hole in 3 shots on a 5 par hole is called an eagle shooting 1 under par is a birdie and shooting even with the par is just called par shooting 1 over par is a bogey then 2 over par is a double bogey 3 over par is a triple bogey and so on win by having the lowest score at the end when your group reaches the last hole the person with the lowest overall score is the winner you can keep track of how you re doing throughout the game by comparing your score to the pars for each hole if you re consistently shooting on par or below par you re doing really well in the beginning you will probably shoot over par especially on more difficult 5 par holes this is totally normal you will improve with the more practice you have try a par 3 course when you re starting out a par 3 course means that all the holes on the course are par 3 so the distances between the tee and the hole are shorter than a standard course which has a mixture of par 3 4 and 5 holes these courses are ideal for beginners 4 x research source the total par for the course is the number of pars added up from all the holes this number is typically 72 on a standard golf course less on a smaller course a 9 hole par 3 course would be a total 18 par course stand with your knees and hips slightly bent stand with your feet about hip width apart with your weight evenly distributed between the centers of your feet not your toes or heels bend your knees slightly and lean forward at your hips so the end of your club is reaching the ground where you ll be hitting the ball 5 x research source when thinking about the right way to stand imagine how a bowler stands before bringing the ball back to throw it with their weight even between both feet and slightly bent forward at the hips the non dominant side of your body should be facing your target or the hole for example if you are right handed you will be bringing the club up toward your right and then swinging down and to the left hitting the ball toward your left bring your club back and parallel to the ground first when lifting the club the order from out to in should go clubhead hands arms shoulders hips your dominant arm should stay close to your side and as you pass your dominant sided leg with your hands your weight should start shifting to that leg 6 x research source when the club is parallel to the ground it should be faced so the toe or rounded edge is up toward the sky bring the club up at a 90 degree angle continue moving your weight to your dominant side and fold your elbows to hinge the club straight up 90 degrees from your arms which are about parallel to the ground you should feel your shoulders in an upward rotation and more weight on your dominant hip 7 x research source at this point the toe of your club should be facing back toward the opposite side of the direction you re swinging turn your shoulders to bring the club all the way up twist your shoulders so that your non dominant shoulder is directly below your chin and you re stretching that side s lateral muscle this will move your club up and over your head almost 180 degrees with the club s weight in your hands and arms and the club head pointing down toward the ground 8 x research source picture your hands being at an 1 o clock position that s how high they should be from the ground your dominant hip and ankle as well as your shoulders should feel ready to spring downward toward the ball shift your weight slightly to the other side as you swing the club down as you bring the club down your weight should slightly shift toward the direction you re swinging your dominant elbow should pass in front of your dominant hip but you should keep your body centered with your belt buckle pointed toward the ball 9 x research source keep your wrists hinged like they were as you start to bring the club down to avoid throwing the club s weight from the top straighten your side facing the target as you make contact with the ball as you make contact with the ball your hips continue to turn so that your body straightens on the side you re aiming toward your head should remain behind the ball as you make contact and your dominant wrist should be bent 10 x research source your weight is now mostly shifted to your non dominant side or the side that your target is on extend both your arms fully for the follow through don t stop your swing after you make contact with the ball bring your arms and the club up so that they re almost parallel to the ground toward your target because you re twisting your hips in the swing your arms should move almost inside and back toward your body 11 x research source your dominant knee should kick inward toward the straight knee during the last part of shifting your weight closing the gap between your legs a proper follow through stops with the clubhead below the level of your hands showing you ve maintained control in your arms and wrists and the toe of the clubhead is pointing up toward the sky get the minimum number of clubs you need you re allowed to carry up to 14 clubs in your bag but you only really need a driver putter sand wedge 6 iron 8 iron pitching wedge and a hybrid when starting out you can rent clubs on the golf course or find racks of discounted and used clubs at many sporting goods stores 12 x research source if you ve never played golf before consider going with someone who will let you use their clubs renting clubs at the golf course or going to a driving range to try out different clubs before spending money on your own set obtain tees and balls tees are pretty straightforward they look like a brightly colored wooden or plastic nail that you set your ball on before hitting it for balls there is a range of quality and prices to choose from if you ve never played before buy cheap balls that cost around 20 per dozen 13 x research source you will lose balls when you re first starting out so it s best not to spend too much on them right away some golf courses provide balls for you to play with find out ahead of time if a golf course does this by calling the course office golf balls and tees can be purchased at sporting goods stores invest in some golf gloves and a bag golf gloves are important because you can start getting blisters on your hands from just a few strokes they also help you keep a firm grip on your club even if you re sweating go to a sporting goods store to try on gloves and find ones that fit you 14 x research source for a bag any sturdy bag that carries your clubs balls rain gear water and or snacks will work check out thrift stores yard sales or used gear websites online to find a good deal on a golf bag keep up with your group while you don t need to rush your shots or run to your ball it is important to be ready to hit when it s your turn know when it s your turn and limit your practice swings to 1 or 2 before hitting your ball 15 x research source golf is a social game so chatting with others in your group is expected but not when someone is about to take a shot too much talking during a shot can distract the person and throw them off yell fore if there s a chance your ball will hit someone this is very important when you re starting out because your shots may not go as expected don t wait to yell the moment you see your ball heading toward a person yell fore as loud as you can so they look up and get out of the way of the ball 16 x research source a flying golf ball can seriously injure a person if it hits them this step is important for safety as well as being common courtesy stay out of the way of shots when someone is about to take a shot stand off to the side several yards away and a bit behind them so as not to distract them don t stand or walk between a person taking a shot and their target 17 x research source stay alert of other players not in your group who are using the course occasionally balls from other players will travel onto your hole don t touch the ball and allow the person to come get the ball themselves look for a lost ball for only 5 minutes if you can t find a ball spend only about 5 minutes searching for it after that take a 1 stroke penalty and do another shot from the location you shot from to do this shot stand as close to where you were and drop the ball by holding it out at shoulder length and dropping it to the ground 18 x research source if you lose your ball from tee off just take the penalty stroke and return to your tee to make the shot again,Sports-and-Fitness
how to keep score in golf,fore unlike the scoring system of most sports in golf less is actually more a score of 72 is way better than a score of 102 keeping score in golf may seem simple hit the ball find it hit it again and so on and add up all shots at the end however there are a few subtleties that you should know before you start playing golf and keeping score correctly see step 1 to get started,get a scorecard a round of golf is played over 18 holes 1 x research source after each hole you should record your score on a scorecard even experienced golfers can miss a shot here or there without a scorecard keep track of your score and the scores of the other players in your group typically you are responsible for keeping the score of your opponent and your opponent is responsible for keeping track of yours after every round you have to look over your opponent s card agree that he has written down your score correctly and sign or initial it you ll also have to do this at the very end of the round so if your opponent makes a mistake even assuming it s an honest one that somehow makes your score worse than it should be you have to take the blame for it other players designate one person to be in charge of keeping score for all of the players before the game begins count every purposeful attempt to strike a ball as a stroke it s likely that 99 9 of the time a golfer will make contact with the ball but if he she tries to hit the ball and whiffs it still counts as a shot on the other hand if you take a practice swing and accidentally hit the ball it doesn t count every time you take a swing at the ball therefore it counts as a stroke whether anything good happens or not 2 x research source each hole will have a number of strokes listed under par 3 x research source this is the average amount of strokes it should take to get the ball in the hole if the par is 3 and you make a 4 then your score can be viewed as 1 over if the par for the course is 80 and you finished the course with a 95 then your score is 15 over though you don t have to know them to keep score you should know that a birdie is one stroke under par an eagle is two under par and a bogey is one over par some players decide that they can take no more strokes for each hole than a double bogey or 2 points over par 4 x research source know your penalties penalties are shots that cost you extra points remember that you want your score to be as low as possible and the penalties drive them up here are some penalties 5 x research source if you hit a ball in the water drop a new ball in the designated location and take a 1 stroke penalty if you hit the ball out of bounds as indicated by white stakes re hit from the original location and take a 2 stroke penalty if you lose a ball re hit from the original location and take a 2 stroke penalty add up your points when you re finished add up your scores from each hole for a cumulative total double check it if you re playing in a tournament one of your competitors will be keeping your official score you must check it and then sign your scorecard to make it official the player with the least amount of points wins the game some players add up the points every 9 holes so that they don t have to do too many calculations at the end and can settle disputes over the score more easily know your handicap once you ve played at least ten rounds of golf on the same course or however many rounds you have to play for the course to determine your handicap you ll have a handicap a handicap takes into account your previous scores throughout the same previous round of golf and you can play the game while keeping your handicap in mind the goal is to do better than you previously did 6 x research source if you want to get fancy with the handicap then you can play using the stableford method in this scoring method your golf score is made not of a number of strokes you get per hole but a number of net points you get per hole if your net score is equal to the par you get 2 points if you hit one over par a bogey you get 1 point if you get 1 under par a birdie you get 3 points and if you hit 2 under par an eagle you get 4 points the player with the most points wins 7 x research source score each hole as holes up or holes down 8 x research source this is a great way to play for beginners and you don t have to be as meticulous about keeping track of exactly what happened in every single round all you have to do is win more holes than your opponent so let s say that your score on the first hole was 5 and your opponent s score on the first hole was three your opponent is now one up because your opponent is one hole ahead of you 9 x research source concede a hole if necessary if you re having an impossible time getting the ball into a hole during a certain round and would rather save your energy and sanity then you can give up that hole and move on to the next you get a clean start in the next hole 10 x research source keep track of who has won each hole continue to play and write down who has won each hole after every round just write 1 if you re up a hole for a certain round or 1 if you re down for that round if you and your opponent got the ball in the hole with the same amount of strokes you can write as under the hole and consider it a draw end the game when one player is more holes up than there are holes remaining matches can be one by scores of four and three 11 x research source this means that one player will win after being four holes ahead with only three holes remaining after the 15th hole since the other player will not have the opportunity to win back enough holes to win the round don t obsess over how many shots you re taking if you re a beginner it s more important to focus on getting the ball in the hole than being upset about taking too many shots this way you ll be more focused on falling into a rhythm than overanalyzing your game as you become more advanced you can work on marking down every one of your shots and making room for improvement 12 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to paint a golf cart,if your plain white golf cart looks a little dull for your taste spruce it up with a paint job even if you ve never painted before anyone from an amateur to an expert decorator can make a golf cart look sleek and smooth you can paint your cart any color that you d like as long as you ve got acrylic spray paint and time just make sure you paint your cart at least two days before you plan to use it so the paint has time to dry,clean your cart residual dirt can cause your coats of paint to flake or peel remove all dirt and grime from your cart with an oil based dish soap hose off the soap with cold water and dry off your cart with a towel avoid applying the paint until your cart is completely dry mix dish soap with water in a bucket and apply it to your cart using a rag or sponge clean out the inside of your cart as well removing any belongings or trash so your cart looks like new once you re finished strip the golf cart of its trim take off any removable parts of the golf cart that you do not want painted this will prevent them from getting in the way as you work in addition to the trim remove the bumpers roof and other parts of the frame you don t want to paint 1 x research source make a note or take pictures of where each removable piece goes so you know where to reattach them later apply masking tape to areas you don t want painted for non removable parts of the golf cart that you want to protect from paint use masking tape keep an eye out for license plates logos or other decals that you want to keep visible line the outer edges of the windows to keep from spray painting them use soft edged foam tape to avoid damaging your cart sand down the body of the cart with fine grit sandpaper rub down the area in a circular motion with firm pressure this will help the paint stick to the golf cart s nonporous surface make sure to sand away any old paint to avoid it tinting your fresh coats 2 x research source consult a sandpaper size chart to find fine grit sandpaper 120 to 400 grits is ideal 3 x research source after you ve finished sanding use a microfiber cloth to brush off any sanding dust apply a thin coat of paint primer to prevent peeling later on primer helps the spray paint adhere smoothly and evenly to the cart spray the primer in even amounts over the body of the golf cart and wait approximately twenty minutes before adding on paint check the primer s packaging instructions for specifically how long to let it dry 4 x research source use a paint primer made specifically for plastic surfaces if your golf cart is a darker color apply two coats of primer wait twenty to thirty minutes before applying the second coat use an acrylic spray paint acrylic paints adhere better to plastics than most types so avoid vinyl lacquer enamel or chalkboard spray paints if available plastic fusion spray paint is also ideal for adhering to smooth surfaces start with one standard can of spray paint and purchase additional cans as needed make a note of where you purchased your first can so you know where to find the right color add a base coat of paint your base coat should go on lightly so it sticks well to the primer aim your paint can perpendicular to the area you re spraying at about 10 12 inches 25 30 cm away from the surface spray the paint in horizontal sweeps releasing the tip once you ve reached the other side slight overlap is okay but try to apply only one layer at a time 5 x research source spray in short spurts instead of a constant stream for a more focused coat in most cases you will need to apply at least two to three coats let the first coat of paint dry each coat should be distinct and applied separately consult your spray can s instructions for drying times and wait until that much time has passed to start on a second coat usually between twenty to thirty minutes is sufficient 6 x research source apply more coats of paint to achieve a deeper color each coat will make your cart s color look richer and more opaque continue applying coats until you reach the desired color plan out enough time to apply at least three coats of paint though you may need more to make the color you want remove the masking tape ten minutes after spraying removing the tape before it cures will give the paint lines a nice crisp finish try not to touch the paint with your gloves or otherwise to avoid smudging 7 x research source add a coat of clear acrylic sealant after you ve reached the color you want acrylic sealant can secure the coats and give your cart a glossy finish sealant can be applied like spray paint so choose a spray can if you ve never used paint sealants before after applying the coat wait thirty minutes before proceeding to finish the cart 8 x research source one coat is necessary but two coats can create an optional protective layer wait thirty minutes in between applying coats clean up the area either after or while your sealant is drying remove the drop cloths from the ground and store them as desired place any remaining spray cans in a room temperature drawer for future use dispose of or recycle any newspapers rubber gloves or sandpaper squares let your cart dry for at least twenty four hours although the sealant may seem dry after two hours the cart will need time to cure after painting to fully set leave your cart outside or in your garage with the windows and doors open and leave it alone for a full day do not touch your cart during this period to avoid fingerprint smudges reattach any parts you removed before painting after the cart has dried check the weather report for the next day to make sure your cart will not receive wind or rain exposure if the weather looks stormy paint your cart in the garage with the doors open choose a windless well ventilated location paint fumes can induce respiratory problems if used indoors if possible paint your golf cart outside paint in the garage on windy or stormy days wind can inhibit your ability to aim directly at the cart and blow dirt on your fresh coat 9 x research source if you begin having breathing troubles or experience nausea remove yourself from the area to a well ventilated place call poison control for further instructions if you are painting in your garage make sure to open the door to avoid fume inhalation surround the golf cart with drop cloths spray paint has a less focused range than some painting methods and you ll want to avoid painting the floor by accident if you don t have a drop cloth on hand cover the area directly below your cart s body with old newspapers choose canvas over plastic drop cloths as cloth is less slippery and stays more secure on the floor 10 x research source purchase a pair of disposable gloves gloves protect your hands from paint or primer stains while you re working on the cart try not to use gardening or mechanic s gloves while you re working to avoid staining your carts with dirt or grease disposable rubber gloves are ideal to keep your work area clean 11 x research source scrub the paint off with soap and warm water immediately if you get paint on your hands put on a pair of work clothes you don t mind staining spray paint can be tough to remove from clothes avoid wearing anything you care about in case of any mishaps an old t shirt and sweatpants are the perfect attire for painting a golf cart wear goggles and a dust mask spray paint can emit toxic fumes and some people may be more vulnerable to breathing troubles than others wear a dust mask to protect your breathing especially if you re painting in your garage put on a pair of goggles as well to protect your eyes 12 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to make a putting green,having your own putting green in your backyard makes it easy to practice putting in your spare time a real putting green will require money extensive labor and constant attention even with diligence a real green in your backyard may pale in comparison with the ones you are familiar with on the links 1 x research source you ll need to choose the right location before anything else then you can start designing the area and using the right nutrients with the proper tools and materials you can incorporate a putting green into your backyard s overall landscape and enjoy the recreational benefits,choose your green location you ll want your green to be located in an open area in your backyard that gets plenty of sunlight your future green should receive plenty of airflow without any blockage of wind from buildings bushes or trees low spots in your backyard or areas that drain poorly should also be avoided but after you ve found the ideal place for your green you should 2 x research source imagine the overall dimensions for your green after you have a feel for the features of your soon to be putting green take a piece of paper and sketch out the general design including desired measurements then measure and stake out your planned putting green area keep in mind the larger your green the more effort it will take to maintain and the greater the cost of its installation evaluate your soil for the turf of your green to flourish its roots will need the right kind of soil most soils are suitable for the roots of your grass though the ideal soil composition will be sandy loam soil if your soil has a high concentration of clay your turf will suffer greatly and may not be able to grow well enough for you to putt 3 x research source perform a soil test to check for clay a percolation test can give you a good idea of the whether your soil composition is good enough for the roots of your grass and is relatively easy to perform you will need to dig a hole 2 deep with the width of about a foot now fill your hole with water and allow it to drain over the course of a day then note the time and fill the hole with water again holes that drain in less than 12 hours have a rate of percolation that will support plants the require well drained soil which includes your putting green grass holes that drain in 12 24 hours are suited for plants that live in heavy or clay soil holes that drain in over 24 hours are unsuitable for most plants 4 x research source appraise your surface drainage the contours of your green to be should allow water to drain quickly and easily otherwise your green could fail low areas where water can collect will also bad for your green try to provide multiple drainage routes to keep the grass from becoming waterlogged 5 x research source you can improve drainage conditions by installing drainage tiles below the surface of your green it is advised that you place these close together at a maximum spacing distance of no more than 10 feet 3 m 6 x research source research grass seed by region there are two dominant types of grass used to build putting greens creeping bentgrass and bermuda depending on region you may want to use one over the other or you in certain areas a hybrid might flourish to check the distribution of creeping bentgrass and bermuda according to state visit 7 x research source http www putting greens com types html ready the soil you ll need to tear up any original sod where you plan to make your green after sod removal you should rake rocks and other debris to create optimal drainage aeration and seeding conditions 8 x research source using a tiller for the soil will loosen and aerate the soil even more promoting even better growth and soil consistency keep in mind that spring is the best time to plant a putting green add some drainage if necessary the best way to ensure that your putting area stays sufficiently drained is to install drainage tiles or vented plastic pipe dig a trenches that are roughly 24 inches 61 cm deep and 12 inches wide that lead from the edges of your green and through it with the trench sloping downward away from your green leading water away from it to install drainage you should place filter fabric around the bottom of your trench so it reaches up the sides lay your perforated vented plastic pipe in the trench fill your trench with 12 inches 30 5 cm of coarse clean gravel fold the ends of your filter fabric on top of your gravel refill the remainder of your trench with soil 9 x research source separate your green to protect against weeds an extra degree of separation can not only keep your putting green more weed free it can also keep your yard from getting invaded with bentgrass or bermuda using a plastic lining is a good way to protect your green from your yard and your yard from your green smooth the soil for your first attempt at making your own putting green the easiest kind to make are mostly level low spots can ruin the quality of your grass so you should spread soil evenly with your rake 10 x research source keep about a yard of sand off to the side to fill in low spots animal tracks or any other unplanned changes to your green 11 x research source sink your putting hole using your bulb planter create a hole slightly larger than a golf ball where you think would be best for you putting hole this is just to give you an idea of the layout of your green you will sculpt the hole and insert the putting cup later sow your grass seed mix some of your seed with your sand to offer it additional cover when you scatter it this can be helpful if you have a bird problem though if you notice birds feeding heavily on your seed you may want to scatter extra in principle a pound of seed should cover about 2 000 square feet though there will be some variance depending on the kind of grass on which you decide 12 x research source fertilize your seed depending on the kind of grass you have chosen to use for your green there will be many different options of fertilizer you can use you should research the fertilizer best suited for your seed by searching online 13 x research source different types of grass will also have ideal times at which you should apply fertilizer research this information as well to see best results in your grass growth water your seed heavily newly sown grass is very thirsty so you ll need to water your putting green heavily twice daily many putting green designers also recommend syringing your green especially in hot weather 14 x research source syringing is where you lightly water turf to cool off your turf canopy and prevent wilt if no complications arise your turf should germinate in 10 days 15 x research source mow with a greens mower the first cut of your putting green grass should be after the grass has exceed two inches in height you will need to be careful when walking behind your greens mower walk with gentle flat footed steps as the top layer of your green will still be loose as a good root system grows the ground will firm up mow the putting green often by cutting your grass 3 or 4 times per week it will maintain a height of around ¼ a perfect putting height 16 x research source continue to fertilize for every 1 000 square feet of yard space apply at least ½ pound of nitrogen to the soil between early may and early june from mid september to mid november use at least 1 pound of nitrogen 17 x research source you should also look into special fertilizer formulated for your type of grass and or putting greens many companies have special blends of fertilizer you ll need to research for yourself to find what works best for your situation apply fungicide monthly this will also depend on the kind of grass you have decided and the area in which you live certain kinds of grass are more susceptible to certain kinds of mold and some strains of mold might not live in your region generally you should administer fungicide once every month 18 x research source keep your green from wilting at the first sign of dryness you should water your green to prevent it from sun damage apply water to the putting green during the early morning hours such as between 5 and 7 a m insert your putting cup if desired the small hole you dug for your putting hole may suffice for your needs but installing a cup will give your green a more realistic feel you can further sculpt your putting hole by using a jigsaw or a golf hole cutter and insert the cup your cup should sit a ½ below the grass level plant your flag to complete the aesthetic you can take the component flag that came with your putting cup and insert it into your cup this is a good way of checking to see if your cup has been placed in the hole flush with the ground an unlevel cup might mean your ball bounces out of the hole more frequently than it should,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hit a driver for beginners,driving can be the most intimidating part of golfing for beginners it s the first shot on any hole so it s important to get it right make sure to position yourself and the ball correctly then use proper balance and technique as you swing to hit the ball avoid typical mistakes that beginners make like trying to hit the ball with all your strength and with a little practice you ll be sending drives straight and far down the fairway in no time,set your stance wider than your shoulders stand straight with your feet out slightly wider than your shoulders a wide stance will allow you to have a longer swing when you drive 1 x research source in general longer clubs need wider stances while shorter clubs need narrower stances for example you would use a very narrow stance for a short wedge club line the ball up with the inside of your dominant foot in front of you many beginners tend to place the ball exactly in the middle you need to set the ball more forward in your stance since the driver is a long club to allow the driver to square up with it 2 x research source this also means that the driver will hit the ball on the upswing which creates less spin and straighter drives grip the club like a baseball bat with your dominant hand in front place both your hands on the grip of the driver the same way you would hold a baseball bat but with the club angled down towards the ball point the butt end of the club at your belt buckle or where it would be 3 x research source you can try interlocking the little finger of your dominant hand with the index finger of your non dominant hand this can add comfort and stability to your swing hold the driver 10 12 inches 25 30 cm away from your body hold the handle of the club so that the butt end is about 10 12 inches 25 30 cm away from your belt buckle back away from the ball until you create enough space to hold the driver at this distance 4 x research source having your hands too close to your body will create a poor swing during the first part of the swing tee the ball up high with a 2 75 inches 7 0 cm tee use a standard 2 75 inches 7 0 cm tee and barely stick it in the ground this allows you to hit more of the ball on the upswing and send it further and straighter 5 x research source as you get more experienced you can adjust the height that you tee the ball at to suit your style and preference pick a target in the distance to aim for choose a tree or a far away bunker instead of just looking down the green stare at your target and use it to line up your stance to get ready to begin your swing 6 x research source as a beginner it s easy to make the mistake of just aiming down the fairway and swinging away with all you ve got instead of picking a target to focus on waggle the club back and forth to loosen up before you start your backswing don t lock up tight or you will have a poor swing waggle the club until you feel your fingers and feet loosen up 7 x research source lots of beginners freeze up under the pressure of driving it is critical to keep your body relaxed to drive well stay balanced go slow and spend time at the top of your backswing keep your center of gravity in the middle as you start your backswing slowly pull the driver back and up above your head pause at the top of your backswing for just a fraction of a second before you bring it back down towards the ball 8 x research source many beginners make the mistake of letting their center of gravity shift to the back which will take away accuracy and power when you drive the pause at the top is really just a slight hesitation that will allow your body to adjust and align the driver for the downswing many beginners don t let the club reach the top all the way on their backswing which takes away power and accuracy from the swing as well it s a common misconception among beginners that you must pull the driver back and swing as fast as possible when in fact the opposite is true focus on your form during the backswing and pull the club back slowly use a sweeping motion and shift your balance forward during the downswing bring the driver back down at the ball and shift your center of gravity to your front foot as you make contact use a sweeping motion instead of a downward angle to give the ball more lift and less spin 9 x research source remember that you don t need to hit the ball at full force to send it far driving is more about form balance and technique than power swing through the ball and maintain your arm speed after you hit it let your arms keep swinging in a sweeping motion even after you make contact with the ball this will create a smooth swing tempo and give your drive more accuracy 10 x research source as a beginner you may be tempted to just hit the ball hard and then forcefully stop your swing but remember to allow your arms and body to fully complete the swing you should end with the driver above your head again in front of you,Sports-and-Fitness
how to spin a golf ball,backspin on a golf ball causes it to spin backwards as it travels through the air making the ball back up after hitting the ground this is an especially useful technique when hitting your ball onto a green that has a hole nested close to and right behind a sand trap hitting a ball with backspin will allow you to land the ball beyond the hole then the spin will carry it backwards in the direction of the hole,examine the grass you ll want the grass you ll be landing your back spinned ball onto to be closely cropped long or irregularly groomed grass will create more resistance to your ball hampering its spin it also increases the chances of the grass getting caught between the ball and your club face reducing the backspin backspin is possible when hitting your shot in longer grass though it ll likely be easiest for you to practice hitting your shots from close cropped well groomed grass 1 x research source choose your golf ball most regular golf balls come in 2 types soft core and hard core a soft core will make it easier for you to backspin your ball than one that has a hard core for this reason you may want to begin practicing backspin with soft core balls hard core balls are used to get more distance in a shot and frequently have a compression rating of 100 soft core balls typically have more backspin when struck which results in more control for backspin purposes a compression rating of 90 might be best softer cover balls will also grip your club better creating a greater backspin effect for this reason you may also want to choose golf balls with soft cover and core if you only have hard core balls available practice the technique using them once you have soft core balls you can apply what you ve practiced and greatly backspin the ball 2 x research source determine the type of golf club you ll be using you should prioritize lofted clubs like irons wedges or lob wedges clubs with more loft on them are the easiest to impart backspin with especially the lob wedge so beginning with one of these can help you master this difficult shot with greater ease 3 x research source lofted clubs are preferred because there is a greater distance between the loft of the club and angle of attack of the club head which increases the backspin since height is an important factor when choosing the type of club you ll be using for your backspin shot you should avoid clubs over a 7 iron like a 6 5 4 or 3 iron inspect your club bits of grass or turf can sometimes stick to the head of your club creating an uneven surface on it this can negatively impact your backspin game as it causes grass or turf to come between the ball and the club head to prevent this from happening inspect the clubface to see if it is worn or dirty grass dirt or other gunk can be wiped away in most cases with a rag dampened with water for more intensive cleaning you should follow your club s care instructions if you notice wear like scuff marks scratches or other blemishes that may affect the performance of the club you may want to select a different iron wedge or lob wedge damaged clubs can often be taken to a professional golf club repair person to get the clubface re grooved if it is worn down position yourself so the ball is deep in your stance deep in this sense generally refers to the back of the ball being positioned or played toward the back of your stance as opposed to in the center or toward the front of your stance placing your ball 1 inch 2 5 cm or so toward your back foot should be enough for backspin purposes 4 x research source by placing the ball deeper in your stance your club will come in contact with the ball on a downward angle which can increase the distance between the amount of loft the club head has and the angle of attack of the club head every golfer is unique you may find that you have the best luck with backspin with your ball even deeper in your stance or you may find that only 1 2 inch 1 3 cm backwards placement is enough aim to compress the ball against the club face compression is essential for creating backspin the ball will be compressed against the club face if the club is accelerating or maintaining a constant speed when it comes into contact with the ball creating more backspin if the club is decelerating the ball will roll up the face of the club and won t create as much backspin therefore ensure the club isn t decelerating through impact swing your golf club for a backspin shot when raising your club to swing make sure that you raise it into an upright straight position before bringing it down to swing aim to increase the angle of attack into the ball so the club head travels down to the ball at a steeper angle that you would normally use when shooting for backspin you should always come into contact with the ball before you strike the soil attempt to make a shallow divot when you follow through with a shot in which the angle of attack is steep it s almost certain that you ll dig into the turf and form a divot when executing the backspin swing try out different techniques to find one that creates a shallow and relatively short divot a deep divot could signify that your angle of approach to the ball is too sharp which can negatively impact the direction or distance of your shot you ll have to experiment with small adjustments to your ball address and swing to determine the cause of deep divots 5 x research source maintain good form in the follow through let your hands lead the club head through impact in particular you ll want to keep your wrists straight when your club comes in contact with the ground this can often cause your wrists to move out of alignment which is also known as breaking maintaining the correct position of your wrists through the impact with the ball is integral for consistent backspin 6 x research source backspin into the wind wind direction is highly important when learning backspin shots hitting into the wind will often result in increased spin however this may be back spin which is desired or it may be side spin which can cause your ball to travel off course the higher your ball goes the more time it has to travel sideways aim to hit shots with lots of backspin when there isn t much head wind you may find that you are never able to consistently backspin without a favorable wind many professionals avoid attempting to hit shots with higher than average backspin when the wind is against them 7 x research source backspin long shots for better results friction is essential to creating backspin so it s more difficult to create backspin on short shots like those at 50 yards 46 m it s easier to create friction between the ball and the club face when the club head is travelling at higher speeds such as those used when hitting shots at longer distances such as 160 yards 150 m you may want to start with mid to long range shots while learning backspin 8 x research source strike low on the face of the ball the face of your ball is the circle you see when viewing the ball head on hitting your ball lower on its back face will create even greater force in your backspin improving it this characteristic is called the vertical gear effect it states that balls hit lower on the face will have greater spin than those that are hit high 9 x research source if you hit a shot high on the club face grass may be caught between the ball and club face as the club head travels toward the ball into and through the ground lower,Sports-and-Fitness
how to drive a golf cart,the golf cart became a widespread vehicle for golf courses in the 1950s since their development and popularity within the golfing community they ve branched out to be used by a variety of events and organizations while the golf cart is a simple vehicle to operate it must be used in consideration for the safety of others,understand golf carts golf carts are classified under neighborhood electric vehicles despite the vehicle s name golf carts are used off golf courses for a variety of reasons golf carts fall between 15 35 mph top speed by regulation standards you must be 14 years of age or older to drive a golf cart you don t need a license to drive a golf cart depending on what state or county you live in you may need a permit to operate a golf cart 1 x research source most state s allow an unlicensed driver to drive on private roads but not on main roads for long distances it s okay to cross an intersection of a main road you ll need a license to drive on public roads 2 x research source use the key like the golf cart s older cousin the automobile you will need a key to start it insert the key in the key slot and turn it to the right you probably won t hear a loud startup like you would for a car most golf carts run on electricity and the key merely turns the battery on you may also see a reverse setting but set the key to forward motion some golf carts run on gasoline and electricity these carts will start up with a familiar engine sound put your seat belt on although the golf carts do not run too fast it s still a good idea to buckle up some carts won t exceed 14 mph and therefore don t have seat belts be sure that any young children riding with you know to remain seated accelerate once everyone is seated you re ready to accelerate in the golf cart use your foot to press down on the thin right pedal 3 x research source the pedal is sensitive to the amount of pressure you use start with mild pressure using your foot to get a feeling for the handle of the golf cart once you understand how the cart operates add more pressure to the pedal do not floor the acceleration pedal upon startup increase the pressure and speed with your foot on the pedal gradually use the brake take your foot off the acceleration pedal and press it on the wider pedal 4 x research source this is the same setup for automobiles with the left pedal usually the widest pedal activates the vehicle s brakes don t slam on the brake unless you absolutely have to for normal use ease onto the break much like you use the acceleration pedal drive backwards to go backwards pull or turn the switch on your cart and use the acceleration pedal most golf carts will not go as fast using the backwards setting turn your body by putting your right arm around the back of the passenger seat this position will allow you to see everything behind you drive at night it is important to take extra precautions when driving at night before driving at night make sure your golf cart is equipped with headlights brake lights turn signals and reflective devices if you don t have these safety measures on your vehicle reconsider driving at night or consider investing into your cart understand the rules of the road golf carts are not allowed on any road with a posted speed that exceeds 35 mph this is for the safety of the golf cart and the other cars on the road aside from safety measures golf carts can cause unexpected traffic which could lead to aggravated drivers over half the states don t allow golf carts on public roads for safety measures golf carts cannot be on roads above 35 mph your golf cart needs to be able to go 25 mph to access public roads these are the current list of states that allow golf carts on public roads ca nv az nm co wy il mn ia fl ga and tx 5 x trustworthy source national highway traffic safety administration u s government agency responsible for writing and enforcing federal motor vehicle safety standards go to source use the horn the horn is another practical safety measure it is especially efficient used at intersections while the horn isn t encouraged on the golf course it is great for off the course this can help pedestrians and other golfers to watch out for your cart 6 x research source try not to use the horn with malice towards another player slow down when turning just like with automobiles you need to slow down when turning your cart even turning at a speed of 11 mph can project a passenger from the golf cart golf carts don t have doors and some don t even have seatbelts keep your passengers and yourself safe by slowing down significantly before turning consider insurance there is never a guarantee you won t injure someone if you own a golf cart many insurance agencies will offer a wide insurance plan that covers vehicles like segways golf carts and snowmobiles insurance will help you pay for medical bills and damage to your vehicle 7 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to build a golf green,many golf enthusiasts build golf greens in their back yards so they can practice putting without traveling to a golf course and paying fees while you can build a golf green by grooming the grass you have or by planting grass if you want a green that meets the standards of the u s golf association usga you must excavate the area bring in gravel and topsoil and install irrigation and drainage systems,choose a location your green should be built on a spot that has sandy soil plenty of sun and good drainage the location must also allow for breezes to come through in order to keep the grass healthy 1 x research source excavate the area of your golf green to a depth of 20 inches 51 cm be sure to remove all the existing sod so you don t have to contend with weeds design the green it should have a variety of slopes to challenge you but ultimately slope away from the center this will prevent puddles from forming after it rains if you want to have a depression in your green you must install a drain pipe beneath it to carry away the water however this won t work if you build a green in a climate where the puddle will freeze during winter install the drainage system in 8 inch 20 cm trenches to ensure that water will drain away from the center 2 x research source duct tape the connections and wrap the pipes so they won t come apart or you ll have to dig up your green to make repairs later put in an irrigation system if necessary keep in mind that adequate even irrigation is the key to keeping turf healthy watering your green with a garden hose is time consuming and tends to irrigate unevenly it s easiest to use your municipal water source if you do not live in an area that restricts water usage during droughts if you choose a different water source well rainwater gray water etc you will have to more carefully monitor the effect of the water on your turf and irrigation system some water sources may clog sprinkler nozzles or introduce harmful chemicals you can water your green with garden sprinklers or drip lines connected to timers but you will spend a lot of time moving them on and off the green an underground system with pop up sprinklers can be fully automated install a residential sprinkler system rather than one designed for a golf course golf course irrigation systems operate at higher pressures in order to spread the water over a wider area however since you only have one green to irrigate a residential system will work well and is less expensive cover the area with a 4 inch 10 cm layer of pea gravel the gravel will hold water near the roots when you irrigate the green but will allow water to pass through quickly during heavy rain so the grass doesn t drown compact the gravel layer 3 x research source add 2 inches 5 cm of sand on top of the gravel and compact it top the sand with about 14 inches 35 cm of topsoil that consists of 60 percent sand and no more than 20 percent clay it s best if you buy the right soil and bring it in but you can test the soil you ve got to see if it meets usga standards compact this layer seed or sod your green sodding often results in an uneven green so seed instead if you have the time and patience to care for the grass until it matures the variety of grass you will use for your green will largely depend on your climate 4 x research source mark the edges of your green by sodding the perimeter with rougher grass you may want to add a vapor barrier around your green before sodding to keep the surrounding area from sucking water away or adding water to your green buy your cups pins and flags from a supplier of golf course equipment you may also want a cup changer that will allow you to change the position of your cup you will also need to buy a special mower and mow your new green every day you might be able to pick up a used one for less than 5000 00 5 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hit a power fade,the power fade is an advanced golf shot that has been used for years but recently mastered and brought to the forefront of the golf game by young players such as tiger woods phil mickelson and ernie els for advanced players the power fade adds a whole new element to one s arsenal of shots but do not mistake the power fade for the ballooning megaslice that is hit by most amateur golfers,know what it is and when to use it a power fade is when you purposely drive the ball and the ball curves from left to right from the tee the ideal time to use it is when there is trouble on the left of a hole forcing you to turn to the right a power fade may be easier than hitting a straight drive 1 x research source a shot may have the same movement because the clubface was accidently left wide open upon impact or when you slice the ball accidentally cutting across its face 2 x research source you may also use the power fade when your tee shot already has a left to right curve but during the curve the ball loses momentum you may also use the power fade for a consistent shot off the tee 3 x research source tee the ball and position your feet place the ball on the right of the tee box give yourself more room for your drive to move to the left before curving towards center place the tee one ball width ahead of your normal stance align your stance to a location between the troubled section on the left and the center of the fairway this alignment is going to be the line your shot will follow before it moves towards center 4 x research source your body feet hips and shoulders should be in the direction where you want the ball to start off which is towards the left of the green your club should be aimed toward the pi which is where you want the ball to end 5 x research source keep your tee low line the equator of your ball with the sweet spot of your club keeping the tee height low encourages your swing to stay level through impact and discourage a pull hook placing the tee slightly ahead of your stance and lower than normal forces you to hold your release which keeps the face open 6 x research source grip the left side of your club firmly you do not want the club face closing over on impact use the last three fingers to create a strong grip on the left side this grip ensures your swing stays open as the swing goes through passed impact 7 x research source stand the correct distance from the ball the distance between you and the ball determines whether your swing will be flat or upright as you move away from the ball your swing will be flat in contrast your swing will be upright the closer you are to the ball if you want to drive the ball a greater trajectory stand further away from the tee 8 x research source the difference in your swing plane and the degree that you rotate your clubface determines the shape of your swing choke down on your club if you re standing closer to the the tee this will lower its trajectory 9 x research source aim left and complete your normal backswing and downswing your setup determines the movement of the ball so employ your backswing and downswing as your normally would aim for the left quadrant outside of the ball this increases your chance of having it fade back to the center line 10 x research source don t try to hit the ball with all your force and focus on technique you may be prone for more mistakes like hooking the ball the harder and faster you swing 11 x research source emphasize your backswing keep your shoulders at 90 degrees to your target line to create a lot of torque in order to increase the distance of your shot improve the turn in your backswing to create separation between your shoulders and hips during your downswing which creates the torque needed for increased speed after you complete your backswing first unwind your lower body and then whip your club through impact 12 x research source focus on a descending strike by slightly leaning the shaft forward 13 x research source average golfers often come over the top of the ball when attempting a power fade as they hit from out to in which creates a weak pull slice hit from the inside by rotating the clubface a few degrees to keep it open 14 x research source swing along your body lines your setup should have your club face aiming straight at your target while your body feet waist shoulders is shifted to the left keep your clubface where it is and swing as if you re trying to hit the ball to the left because you ve kept the clubface facing straight towards the target the ball will move back on your line your setup produces your ball flight not your swing 15 x research source use a coat hanger to correct a megaslice beginner golfers often create a ballooning megaslice because their clubface is open upon impact correct this issue by practicing with a coat hanger on the lead side of your grip so that it touches your forearm make sure the coat hanger remains touching your wrist during your backswing and all the way through impact 16 x research source you cannot get rid of a slice without working on the open face of your club it doesn t matter how much you work on other factors like flight path 17 x research source cupping your wrist causes the coat hanger to move away from your forearm and for the face of your club to be facing forward at the apex of your backswing you want to correct this issue flex your wrist so that the coathanger remains touching your forearm throughout the full range of motion prior to impact the clubface should also be facing the sky and parallel to your forearm at the apex of your backswing 18 x research source go slowly to focus on your technique as you practice this drill rehearse as many times as you need in the driving range until you no longer need the coat hanger 19 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to read greens,the difference between a good score and a great score out on the golf course may be the result of effective putting sinking balls in a single stroke involves reading greens accurately a skill any golfer can learn effective golfers study the green from many angles before settling on a shot they take their time pick their shot then write that birdie in on their scorecard time and time again,gauge the green s flatness to determine how to putt the ball to the hole reading a green is about anticipating how your golf ball will move from your putter to the hole no green is perfectly flat so you always need to take a close look at the slope to do this any hills or divots will also change the speed of your ball and sometimes its trajectory you can t always putt along the flattest part of the green most times you need to hit the ball along the green s slope in order to curve the ball towards the hole the route your ball takes from the putter to the green is called a line always take time to read the green s slope before determining your line stand behind the hole to determine the slope around it the read you get while behind the hole is often the most important one crouch down if you need to do so in order to get a closer look then look back up towards your ball note how the green looks from this perspective paying attention in particular to how the slope changes a few steps from the hole 1 x research source to visualize the read imagine pouring water into the hole ask yourself which way the water would spill out if it were to overflow you expect the water to spill out towards the lower end of a slope the last stretch of green before the hole has the most impact on your ball the ball rolls at such a slow speed that the green s slope has more of a pull on it walk along the lower side of the hole as you return to your ball once you have identified which part of the green is lowest you know which way your ball will roll after you hit it stroll back to your ball taking plenty of time to examine how the green changes any subtle changes such as slope increases have an effect on how your ball moves 2 x research source if you are uncertain of a particular spot you need to hit through crouch get a close look at the grass note any uneven spots that can drag your ball away from the hole check the perspective around the ball to improve your read get multiple reads until you have a good feel for the green try walking to the higher side of the green and imagining how you want to hit the ball if you still aren t sure walk back to the midpoint between the ball and hole 3 x research source you should have a pretty good idea of how the ball will move on the green keep looking at the green from different angles until you feel confident about your read when you re standing between the ball and cup take a few practice swings until you feel comfortable with the read stand over the ball to analyze the ground around it return to your ball taking care to avoid any penalties from disturbing it look down and notice if the ball is higher or lower than your feet this should give you a little extra information about how the ball will behave fine tune your approach to compensate for the slope near your ball for example if your right foot is higher than the bottom of the ball the ball will roll towards your left foot you can adjust your stroke by hitting the ball towards your right foot squat behind the ball to finalize your read complete your read with a worm s eye view of the ball s path to the hole after all no one can be more familiar with the intricacies of a green than someone who sees it up close examine the ball s path to the green to make any final adjustments to your approach 4 x research source to visualize the ball s path imagine what it will do if you hit it straight at the hole from analyzing the green from so many angles you should be able to figure out where the ball would go take your time when reading greens getting a good read can seem like a slow process especially when you re starting out however rushing is a fast pass to a 2 putt or even a dreaded 3 putt wait until you feel confident with your read and comfortable taking the putt you may feel rushed when other golfers are waiting for you remember to tune this out and let the golf course be a peaceful place to enjoy hitting a small dimpled ball once you get used to reading greens you can often do it within 30 to 60 seconds but don t despair if you need extra time ask someone else for a second opinion if possible even the best professional golfers turn to their caddies from time to time get the opinion of a caddie friend partner or teacher they should go through a similar process as you studying the green from different angles before offering their advice 5 x research source in some circumstances such as during a competitive round you may not get a chance to ask anyone unless you have a caddie take extra time to get comfortable with your read remember that an opinion is nothing more than an opinion if you still think you re right stick with your initial read avoid overthinking your read while you should take as much time as you need to read a green you shouldn t ever doubt your read having a clear confident image of the ball s trajectory is important when hitting it if you have any doubt you may end up altering your swing and getting yourself into trouble with a poor putt 6 x research source stick to your instincts your first read is usually the best unless you have good evidence that your read was wrong envision a line tracing how the ball will roll to the hole use this line to calculate how the slope of the green will affect the ball s movement after you hit it the line should move towards the higher side of the green then head to the hole where you think the ball will break back towards the hole seeing the line can help you hit the ball with confidence imagining a clear line can take some practice at first you may not be able to hit the ball exactly along your line master your putting technique as you get more confident reading greens adjust your aim according to the slope once you have read the green stand near the ball and imagine where you will hit it the slope is the most integral influence on the ball s movement you will need to hit the ball towards the slope so it rolls back down towards the hole position yourself to hit the ball in this direction 7 x research source for instance if the green slopes down to the right aim to the left to let the ball roll downhill towards the cup hit the ball harder for high grain grasses bermuda grass is known to play slower than regular grass which means you need to hit the ball harder to get it to the cup bermuda grass often has a stronger grain than regular grass to see the grain look at the tips of the grass blades and notice which way they are pointing if the blades point towards your ball they will resist it and slow down its movement 8 x research source with slower greens you may wish to get a second read to make sure your approach is right putt softer on fast or bumpy greens if you notice that the green looks uneven you probably need to hit the ball a little lighter than usual in order to avoid overshooting the hole you may notice bumps or other rough patches when you crouch down to analyze the green closely fast greens are another problem that require you to slow your ball 9 x research source to know if a green is fast watch how others hit their balls you will also know by putting on greens at other holes on the course on fast greens the ball faces less resistance than usual and rolls faster take a few practice strokes beside the ball make practice strokes a part of the routine you go through before taking any shot it gives you a final chance to look from your ball to the hole picture the ball rolling along the line you chose then loosen up before taking your actual shot hit the ball firmly towards the hole shake out your arms to loosen yourself up if you need to keep a firm grip on your putter take a deep breath and hit cleanly through the ball avoid stopping your swing short or else your ball will end up short of the hole trust in your read and hit well to sink that ball 10 x research source aim your club towards your target which is where you want to hit the ball the target is the part of the green that will cause the ball to roll down into the hole,Sports-and-Fitness
how to chip a golf ball,a chip is a tactical shot in golf where the player lifts the ball into the air once the ball hits the ground a proper chip will result in a long roll chipped shots are perfect if your ball is buried in the grass or if you re trying to navigate a downhill slope 1 x research source whether you re new to golf or an experienced player perfecting a chipped shot is necessary if you want to get serious about the sport,align the ball with your sternum much of a good chip in golf revolves around proper stance and positioning you should aim your body slightly ahead of the ball with your sternum drawing a parallel line with the location of the ball the sternum refers to the middle of one s chest keep your chest up 2 x research source keep your arms back and your chest up throughout the course of your swing arching your chest will result in a skewed chip because it will change direction of the club if you re having any difficulty with achieving a proper stance get someone else to watch you place your feet closely together 3 x research source your feet should be planted firmly on the ground while you execute a chip there should be a space between your feet roughly equivalent to one of your feet your feet should be parallel with one another both aimed directly forward open up your hip 4 x research source a proper swing will disperse the exertion throughout your upper body rather than packing the strain into one area letting your hip on the other side of the club move around will take some of the stress off your wrists swing with your full upper body 5 x research source use your entire upper body to facilitate the chip avoid swinging with your wrists as this movement will limit your force and control swing so that you re able to feel the movement in your hips while your upper body should be limber throughout the movement keep your feet and legs relatively stable swing downward your initial contact with the ball should be in a downward strike the most common mistake beginners make is to hit up rather the first part of a successful chip swing will aim down only moving up once the club makes contact with the ball raise the club as it makes impact with the golf ball 6 x research source while you ll be able to maximize your force and control by swinging downward scooping up when your club meets the ball will give the ball the air it needs to escape the grass both the downward swing and upward scoop should be accomplished in a single fluid motion when you become more experienced with chipping you may control the chipping force to accommodate the distance you want the ball to sail follow through with the motion after the ball has made contact a proper chip won t end with the ball s impact in order to maximize your force you should see the swing through leaving your club back up in the air complete the swing in the same fluid motion you started with watch where the ball ends up after a chip the ball should fly a short distance and proceed to roll as with any golf shot you should keep your eye on where the ball lands keeping an eye on the ball is important during practice as well it can teach you how much force you need with each club to go a given distance decide if the situation warrants chipping the ball chipping the ball is a more strategic move than a regular golf shot it is meant to get your ball out of a tricky situation such as if you re caught in the grass or trying to navigate past a hill chipping the golf ball should not be used in instances where a normal shot can easily be employed this rule doesn t apply if you re trying to learn the shot if anything you should practice the basics of chipping on a smooth surface before you move on to its usual application choose a club with the right ratio 7 x research source a ratio refers to the distance you want the ball to fly compared to the distance you want it to roll after because chip shots are used to get your ball out of the grass and back on course you can estimate the distance from the grassed ball to the green plus the distance you want the ball to go on the green you can measure the distances by using footsteps for instance if your ball is five steps away from the green and the hole is ten steps following that you will have a 1 to 2 ratio a sand wedge is good for a 1 to 1 ratio from the grass to the green a pitching wedge is good for a 1 to 2 ratio a 9 iron is a 1 to 3 ratio hold your club firmly with any shot including chipping you should hold the golf club firmly because chipping the ball successfully requires so much control make sure your hands are placed properly on the club before you attempt to chip the ball get lessons lessons will accelerate the learning process although some golf instructors can be quite pricey ranging upwards of 100 usd per hour getting a few lessons in will help you to unlearn bad habits you may have picked up on your own train using an elongated club 8 x research source if you re having any issues with footing and stance an elongated club will act as a helpful indicator of when you go too far if you swing too far or change your back position the back of the club will clip you in the back this slightly painful reprimand will remind you that you re doing it wrong holding a pool stick alongside the club also works in lieu of a long club make phantom contact with the ball as you work out your stance with a phantom swing you will execute the swing stopping right before the ball itself this movement will allow you to practice the motion of chipping a ball without having to retrieve the ball each time you go through with it practice every week as with any skill you need to commit to regular practice in order to polish your chipping technique you should try to golf at least once a week and when you do include chipping as part of the skills you practice once you figure out the foundation you can treat it as you would any other skill experiment with different chipping stances although there are certain rights and wrong when it comes to golf stances part of the fun of learning involves figuring out your personal style experiment with different footings swings and warm ups although it s important to have a firm learning foundation in place before getting creative it should be seen as a natural part of the learning process to find your own style,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hit irons consistently,when people think of golf they often think of big drives off of the tee box or the drama of a difficult putt but much of the game is played in between these moments and it s important to be able to hit good shots with your irons the keys to consistent shots are a comfortable grip and stance a smooth and fluid swing and practicing to fine tune your game,use correctly sized clubs the right size iron can make a huge difference in your swing additionally the length of your driver and putter are going to be different than the right size of your irons there are several factors that determine the correct club size for you including your swing style skill level posture and height 1 x research source if you are renting clubs or purchasing from a clubhouse ask for assistance to determine your correct club sizing grip the club with your dominant hand with the clubhead resting on the ground grab the club with your dominant hand where the grip connects to the shaft 2 x research source hold the club with your fingers underneath the shaft and your thumb resting across the top of the grip grip the club firmly but not too hard you should not have to bend or lean over to grab the club if you do your club may be too short rest the club in the palm of your non dominant hand if you re right handed place your left hand behind your right and lay the grip of the club across the palm of your left hand if you are left handed then do the opposite rest the thumb of your non dominant hand across the grip of the club 3 x research source it should feel relaxed and comfortable interlock your pinkie finger and your index finger with the thumb of your dominant hand flat across the shaft of the club interlock the pinkie finger of your dominant hand and index finger of non dominant wrap the rest of your fingers around the club this will ensure a tight and secure grip 4 x research source don t grip too hard a tense grip means your swing will not be fluid and smooth try using a baseball grip as an alternative if the standard golf grip is uncomfortable or just isn t working for you you can try using a baseball grip with your dominant hand hold the grip of the club where it meets the shaft then place your non dominant hand behind your dominant and wrap your fingers around the grip it will feel a little like you re holding a baseball bat 5 x research source this grip is also good for children or people who are brand new to golf stand with your feet shoulder width apart this will give you a good foundation and allow you to shift your weight on your backswing and follow through if your stance is too narrow your shot could go off target too wide of a stance will make it more difficult to achieve good rotation 6 x research source try shifting your weight around and rocking back and forth to be sure you re standing in a stable but comfortable position rest the club head on the ground near the ball as you find your grip while you re setting your club into a comfortable grip rest the club on the ground so you can find an accurate position if you set your grip without checking the space between you and the ground you may not have the correct positioning for the shot 7 x research source you also don t want to rest the club head too close the ball if you accidentally tap the ball it may cost you a stroke bend your knees slightly to find a comfortable stance slightly flexed knees allow for better weight distribution comfort and greater rotation during your swing it s important to stay comfortable throughout your swing a rigid posture will lead to a poor shot 8 x research source avoid squatting down too far and check to see that your knees are in line with the balls of your feet balance your weight evenly on your heels and the balls of your feet evenly distribute your weight on both feet but don t let your weight shift back your weight should be spread evenly between your toes and heels in order to effectively rotate your upper body you must be able to rotate on the balls of your feet 9 x research source you can check your weight distribution by wiggling your toes if you can t raise them then your weight is too far forward if you re able to raise the front of your foot then your weight is too far back in your heels bend forward slightly at your hips while keeping your back straight your spine is the part of your body around which your arms and the club will rotate you want to have a straight vertical axis with your head and neck at the same angle as your spine and your chin up and away from your chest to prevent any rounding of your upper back 10 x research source your shoulders should be relaxed and not hunched every little extra bit of bend in your back decreases your ability to rotate your shoulders so keep your back straight make sure that you don t bend at your waist and lower back the rotation of your swing can injure you if you re not in proper alignment line up the ball slightly in front of the centerline of your chest the alignment of the golf ball itself in your stance is another crucial part of having a good shot place the golf ball one ball length over from the centerline of your chest towards your non dominant arm this allows for a better catch on the downswing 11 x research source if you re right handed you can line up the ball with the logo of your shirt use a club to make sure your feet and shoulders are pointed in the right direction this is a quick and easy way to see where you are aiming get into your stance and place a club along the tips of your toes the club should point to where you want your ball to go if it doesn t then adjust your stance 12 x research source after placing the club on the ground it may help to take a step back to see where it is pointing you can also lay a club down to line up your stance and aim your shot line up the center of the clubface behind the ball where the club connects with the ball is also important after you ve found a good grip and position behind the ball line up the broad center of the clubface directly behind the golf ball make sure you re in a comfortable and relaxed position and not don t have to reach down 13 x research source remember not to touch the ball with your club before you swing keep your front arm straight as you bring the club back smoothly golf is a sport that utilizes good technique over raw strength iron shots in particular can go awry if you don t use a good and clean stroke don t overpower or attempt to demolish the ball instead think low and slow as you bring the club into your backswing 14 x research source even though your front arm is meant to be rigid and straight you still need to stay relaxed in order to have fluid motion in your swing hinge the club at your wrists to allow the club to come over your head use your wrists to add a greater range of motion to your swing by allowing the club to travel further overhead keeping your front arm straight allow your wrists to flex so that the club is able to travel further behind this allows for greater torque and momentum in your swing 15 x research source the wrist break should feel natural and comfortable if you have limited mobility in your wrists or if it hurts to hinge at the wrists you may need to modify your swing rotate your hips and torso to allow the club to travel further to increase the power of your swing you need to use the strength of your whole body with your weight evenly distributed on the balls of your feet rotate your hips and shoulders back to increase the backswing of your club 16 x research source move in a smooth and fluid motion rather than moving one section of your body at a time keep your head from moving by keeping your eyes on the golf ball your front arm may bend slightly at the elbow to allow for greater rotation swing the club through with your arms and the rotation of your body don t linger at the top of your backswing for too long with your eyes focused on the ball swing the club down from the top of your backswing as soon as you reach full extension and rotation when you make contact with the ball your front arm should be straight 17 x research source pausing at the top of your backswing causes your body to tense up and will lead to a poor stroke follow through with your swing a good golf shot with an iron does not end when the clubface hits the ball swing all the way through until the club is over your front shoulder an even and consistent swing all the way through will keep the clubface on the same plane and prevent the ball from slicing to the right or hooking to the left 18 x research source keep your head down and your eyes on the ball until your swing is complete take a small divot out of the grass with your swing because irons are designed to make contact with the golf ball on a descending path a proper swing means that the iron is still moving downward after striking the ball and will dig slightly into the grass the club should still strike the ball first but a small scrape on the follow through is the mark of a good iron shot 19 x research source there should not be a large chunk of turf removed striking the ground with your club is bad for your club and could lead to an injury use your irons on the driving range while it is a lot of fun and maybe a little cathartic to get out on the range with your driver and smash some golf balls it s also important to take time to perfect your shots with your irons you may find that slight variations to your grip or stance produce better results 20 x research source the best way to improve your iron shots is to practice them use the distance markers and posts on the driving range to practice your aim use alignment sticks to tighten up your swing alignment rods or sticks are a great tool to improve the form of your swing a common way to use them is to place two rods on the ground parallel to one another aim the sticks to where you want the ball to go and place a golf ball in between them this creates a lane that your swing should follow 21 x research source choose a target down range to aim for as you practice with your irons the alignment sticks can allow you to see any deviation in your swing use an exercise band to improve your swing inconsistent iron strokes are often caused by flaring out your elbows or pulling them in too close to the body during the swing you can correct this error and strengthen your swing by using resistance bands put the band on like a backpack loop both of your thumbs through the bands and take a proper grip on the club as you swing with good form you ll feel a slight inward pull from the bands that you need to counteract by keeping your arms straight 22 x research source the resistance should not be so great that you are straining to keep your arms straight after practicing for a while with the bands on take them off to see if you notice an improvement in your swing don t wear the bands for too long or you can develop tension in your back neck and shoulders do a wood block drill to improve your takeaway speed the takeaway is the first part of the backswing when you begin to bring the club backward get into your golf stance with your iron take a block of wood or a book and place it directly behind your club on the ground with no space between the block and the club then push the object back with the head of your club 23 x research source do this exercise up to 100 times to improve your takeaway speed,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hit golf irons,irons are a type of club employed in the game of golf whereas woods are used to drive the ball long distances irons typically have shorter shafts smaller heads and more angled faces which make them better suited for making short to mid range shots in a variety of green conditions the key to becoming a top shot with your irons is to dial in your stance and ball placement to ensure that you re getting the right point of contact on the ball after that it s simply a matter of making smooth controlled swings that push the ball forward letting the club s lofted head generate the lift needed to send it sailing,position the ball slightly forward of center in your stance stand with the ball a little closer to your lead foot as a good general starting point many experts recommend lining up the ball with the logo on the breast pocket of your shirt if you re not wearing a shirt with a logo this will be a couple of inches to the left of the center of your chest or to the right if you re a left handed golfer 1 x research source avoid placing the ball any further forward than your front armpit or any further back than the center of your body 2 x research source starting with the ball a little more forward will prevent you from having to chop down at it which usually just results in short sloppy fading shots lean in slightly to stay close to the ball bend at the waist until your back forms roughly a 50 degree angle keeping your spine as straight as possible hold your head up so that your crown is in line with your back and hips try to maintain this angle until the ball leaves the head of the club 3 x research source it can help to imagine your chest hovering over the ball up until the moment of impact 4 x research source irons tend to be shorter than woods for this reason it s important to keep your chest and shoulders low throughout your swing even more so than when blasting a drive give yourself a comfortable amount of space for your swing a good rule of thumb is to leave about a hand s width between the backs of your arms and your body if you re too close to the ball you ll be forced to swing just in front of your feet which can make you feel cramped if you re too far away the added distance may give your swing more of a horizontal angle like a baseball swing 5 x research source get in the habit of double checking your body space as part of your setup you want to keep a consistent amount of space on every shot regardless of the iron you re playing with use low smooth swings to make sure you re hitting the ball forward as you begin your backswing keep it low and slow easing the head of the club back then reversing direction and letting it swoop down to meet the ball in a shallow arc by the time the head of the club comes within a few inches of the ball it should be moving more or less straight ahead 6 x research source remember to keep your wrists locked until you enter the apex of your swing just like with any other shot 7 x research source a more subtle swing trajectory will also guarantee that you re sending the ball forward as opposed to upwards tilt your body away from the ball as you make contact shift your weight the same way you would for a normal swing only keep your head and shoulders behind the ball at the moment of impact this will allow you to channel your full momentum into the ball and ensure that the face of the club touches down at just the right angle in relation to the ball s edge 8 x research source try to let your body take on a loose curve from the top of your head to the foot of your back leg if you re a right handed golfer make sure your left shoulder stays slightly higher than your right if you re left handed keep your right shoulder higher 9 x research source shape your iron to better control the direction of your shot rotate the head of the club a few degrees to the left or right to influence the path of the ball as needed when done correctly shaping can enhance your overall accuracy and control especially on hilly courses or in windy conditions 10 x research source if you re facing a slight bank on your lefthand side shaping your club to the left a small amount can help you compensate for the roll caused by the incline and place the ball closer to the hole shaping is an advanced technique and requires a lot of practice to get right it may take dozens or even hundreds of swings before you get to the point where you can deliver the ball exactly where you want it to go 11 x research source maintain your posture throughout your entire swing once you ve got your head back shoulders arms hips and feet right where you want them make sure they stay there until the ball is clear of your club if any part of your form breaks down between your backswing and your follow through it could increase the risk of a mishit 12 x research source resist the urge the stand up or raise your chest and shoulders prematurely this won t help you get more lift in fact it does the exact opposite as it causes the head of your club to strike higher up on the ball 13 x research source train yourself to freeze for 1 2 full seconds after your follow through to avoid developing the bad habit of coming out of position early let the club lift the ball rather than trying to force it into the air one common mistake that newer players often make is attempting to scoop the ball or fling it upwards in an effort to get it airborne by doing this you only end up sacrificing accuracy and distance the lofted head of the club is what s responsible for creating lift so just focus on connecting squarely and pushing the ball forward the iron will take care of the rest 14 x research source to get the hang of hitting in a forward direction take a few half speed swings using a putter then switch to your iron of choice and replicate the same motion check your divots after each shot a good iron shot will often end with a divot which happens when the head of the club slices into the ground after striking the ball taking a piece of the turf with it these marks can be useful indicators of strong precise swings with enough practice you ll notice divots popping up after almost every shot 15 x research source there s a big difference between ending a shot with a nice clean divot and simply digging up chunks of the green you ll know it when you feel it with a textbook divot the head of your club should contact the ball first then the ground this means that the divot itself will be in front of the ball not behind it 16 x research source play your irons to get yourself out of sticky situations irons are designed to get down under the ball and lift them clear of the ground this feature makes them perfect for saving wayward balls from wilder parts of the course including the rough low brush bunkers and even shallow water hazards just be sure to select an iron with a loft suitable for the severity of the terrain 17 x research source the number stamped on an iron corresponds to the amount of loft produced by the head the higher the number the steeper the angle and the greater the loft 18 x research source if you find yourself stuck in a deep bunker you also have the option of grabbing a wedge wedges are a special subset of irons with short shafts high lofts and heavy heads they re used mostly for making short distance lob

how to learn to play golf,golf is a very popular sport that you can play for many years it is great to do in your leisure time as well as with business colleagues you can learn to play golf by learning to hit the ball correctly understanding the basics of the game and practicing your skills the game of golf takes a lot of practice and determination to see success,align your body with the ball your face shoulders hips and feet should all be facing the ball before you swing your body should be parallel to the intended target make sure that your feet are shoulder width apart for maximum balance when using a wood driver fairway club or a club with a bigger head position the ball just forward of the center of your stance to get maximum control and distance lean forward slightly as you position the club to the ball 1 x research source bend your knees slightly and bend forward just a little from the waist to maintain proper posture position your hands correctly on the club place the hand closer to your target on top of the hand that is farther away from the target keep your arms straight but relaxed since you are leaning forward your arms will be hanging down almost straight from your shoulders 2 x research source for example if you are right handed your set up will have your left hand closer to the target your right hand then will be closer to the ground perfect your backswing move the club back away from the ball if you are right handed you move the club backward to the right your right elbow should bend slightly but your left elbow will remain straight your shoulders will twist clockwise slightly as you turn raise the club until it is somewhere between hip and shoulder height this should feel comfortable do not force your body to swing the club high when you swing you don t have to hit the ball as hard as you can it should be an in control swing so just go easy and hit the ball smoothly don t try to hit the ball but to just swing the club and let the head do all of the work 3 x research source if you are left handed this will be reversed you will bring the club backwards to the left bending your left elbow and keeping your right elbow straight hit the ball swing the club forcefully toward and through the ball if you are right handed you will swing the club to the left once you hit the ball follow through with your body turn and club allow the club to continue to swing over your left shoulder at this point both of your elbows will be bent keep your eye on the ball throughout your swing look at where you want the ball to go before you swing this not only helps you strike the ball but also keeps your body from moving too much if you are left handed you will swing the club to the right shorten your backswing with putting as you get closer to the hole you will want to change your swing slightly when you putt for example use a shorter backswing lightly tap the ball the ball should roll on the ground instead of flying through the air continue your follow through and keep your eye on the ball throughout your swing pitch chip or putt 4 x research source use the correct club there are several different types of clubs in a set of golf clubs the driver is the club that is used to hit the ball long distance this should be used on your first hit off the tee box the putter is the club that is used when your ball is on the green an iron is used for hits that are less than 200 yards 180 m away hybrid clubs have been developed recently that combine the benefits of drivers and irons 5 x research source respect the rules of the course while there are specific golf rules that are followed on every course there are often course specific rules as well 6 x research source for example course specific rules indicate where the boundaries are on the course determine the order of play each player in the game should hit their first round in this first round it does not matter who hits the ball first from the tee box however once all of the players have teed off the player who is farthest away from the hole should hit first 7 x research source keep score one point will be awarded to each swing that it takes for you to get the ball into the hole an additional point will be added if the ball goes out of bounds these boundaries vary from course to course the player with the lowest score at the end of the game wins 8 x research source players may also have to add penalty strokes to their score if they do things such as hit the ball into a water hazard or hit the ball out of bounds be conscious of your time remember that there are other people on the course don t rush the people in front of you also pay close attention to how long the course is taking you if you are taking a long time or have fallen approximately a hole behind the group in front of you allow the people behind you to move in front of you 9 x research source take a golf lesson learn golf from people who know and understand the game this can be in the form of a formal paid lesson or informal lesson with a friend your coach will show you the proper way to hit a ball and which clubs are best to use in certain situations golf regularly once you have a good grasp on golf basics you should practice regularly you can practice specific steps like teeing off over and over until you perfect it be intentional about your practice watch others golf you can learn a lot by watching others watch golf videos online or tournaments on the television go to live matches take note of the golfer s body positions and technique try to adopt these techniques

how to improve your putting,your whole golf game can be ruined if you can t putt missing putts is the fastest way to put a bad number on your scorecard it is arguably the hardest part in golf but the skill can be improved,look around you before you putt unlike full shots that have to do with the air putting is all about the contour of the ground look at all your putts from behind the hole and from a 90 degree angle this will give you a clear idea of the distance and elevation of the ground before you putt 1 x research source set the ball near your front foot the ball should be square to the line of target and your eyes should be over the ball let your arms hang loosely and hold the putter lightly make sure to keep your hands level or ahead of the ball through the stroke 2 x research source swing the putter move the putter backward smoothly use your shoulders to hinge your arms not your elbows or wrist keep your putter in line with the target as your swing it backward and then forward maintain your tempo through the swing 3 x research source strike the ball with slight speed the putter head should strike the back of the ball during the upswing it should feel like the palm of your right hand is striking towards the target the best strokes look very smooth because the club is being swung backward and forward at the same speed 4 x research source the strike should feel more like a roll rather than a hit this will give you better distance control and keep the ball from rolling too far past the hole 5 x research source follow through with your club don t follow through with your eyes keep eye contact on the spot where the ball was not where it is going don t allow yourself to look up right away count for two second before you look to see how well you did 6 x research source many golfers make the mistake of having a short follow through and not paying attention to the force of their follow through make a long follow through to the hole it should not be shorter than the takeaway 7 x research source do the around the world drill or clock drill this is an exercise where you will have to be consistent and focused find space on the putting green around a hole set up four golf balls around the hole the balls should be equal distance from the hole your goal is to get them all into the hole each time you make them all into the hole move them a foot further from the hole if you mess up you have to start all over 8 x research source do the coin drill to improve accuracy set up a coin about a foot in front of the ball and putt over the coin try to get the ball to go right over the coin you can use a flat stick to guide your path to the coin if you need to this drill will help improve your accuracy when putting 9 x research source practice your long putts with the long putt points drill the putts that are 20 feet 6 1 m and further are difficult for many golfers the goal of this drill is to put the ball in a three foot range of the hole to be able to make a two putt if you make a two putt then give yourself three points if you make it within the three foot circle give yourself one point this way you will be able to track your progress 10 x research source close your eyes in the mind s eye drill when you are about to putt and have everything where you want it to be close your eyes this will help you relieve your mind and not worry about the ball or the hole or your putt putting with your eyes closed works best for short putts 11 x research source make sure your putter is the correct length it is important that your putter is the appropriate length for you so you can have your hands in the optimal spot on the putter place your hands on the meat of the putter grip then adjust the height of the putter to match length of the putter is important for a sound setup and for your hand eye coordination 12 x research source optimize your angles to keep the ball stable the loft the angle of the club face lifts the ball from the depression it makes on the green and gives the ball a backspin adjust the loft of your club so it comes at the ball straight on 13 x research source the lie angle the angle between the center shaft and the ground can negatively affect a golfer s set up and stroke keep the lie angle where your natural set up is so you don t mess up your stroke 14 x research source find the club weight that is perfect for you if the club is too light it will make it swerve during the follow through add more weight to your club if you notice a jerky motion and difficulty controlling the club use a lighter head weight for faster greens and heavier weights for slower greens if you tend to miss putts in a certain side of the putter add weight to that side keep your grip large when putting although there are many different ways to grip the club when putting keep your grip large this will keep your wrists from breaking and the putter from being manipulated having a large grip will keep the swing in your shoulders giving you more control 15 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to calculate a golf course handicap,a golf handicap is a number that describes the difference between a particular golfer s ability and the standard score and the handicap system allows amateur golfers of differing skill levels to compete on more even terms the lower a handicap the better a player is compared to someone with a higher one to determine a handicap for a specific course you first need to calculate your handicap differential from which you can calculate your handicap index and this is the portable handicap that can be adjusted to apply to any course and any tee,play golf to determine your handicap differential and index you will first need some golf scores to work with for the best results work with at least five scores but using 20 scores is preferable tally your gross score from every individual game the gross score is the actual number of strokes taken over an entire course determine your adjusted gross score on any hole where you ve exceeded the maximum allowable strokes deduct the necessary number of strokes for instance if you took nine strokes on a hole but have a maximum allowable score of seven subtract two from your score for that hole recount your total for the course using the adjusted numbers the united states golf association s equitable stroke control uses the following guidelines for a course handicap of 1 x research source nine or less maximum score per hole is a double bogey 10 to 19 maximum score is seven 20 to 29 maximum score is eight 30 to 39 maximum score is nine 40 and above maximum score is 10 use this default if you haven t yet determined your handicap find the course slope while the course rating is the difficulty rating for a golfer who shoots par on average the course slope is the difficulty rating based on a bogey golfer a bogey golfer is a player who shoots 18 strokes over par on average 2 x research source the course rating and slope for a particular course are usually found on the score card you can also check at the clubhouse or on the course s website determine your handicap differential this is a calculation involving the difference between your adjusted gross score and the course rating the equation to determine this is adjusted gross score course rating x 113 slope rating round this number to the nearest tenth 3 x research source repeat these steps for every score always use your most recent scores up to a maximum of 20 select your best handicap differentials choose your 10 best lowest differentials if you are working with 20 scores if you don t yet have 20 scores to work with select your top differential out of five or six your top two differentials out of seven or eight your top three differentials out of nine or 10 your top four differentials out of 11 or 12 your top five differentials out of 13 or 14 your top six differentials out of 15 or 16 your top seven differentials out of 17 your top eight differentials out of 18 your top nine differentials out of 19 average your best differentials add all the scores together then divide that number by the amount of scores you re working with for instance if you re working with 10 scores add all 10 together and then divide that by 10 if you re working with three differentials divide the sum by three determine your handicap index multiply your differential average by 96 percent or 0 96 then without rounding any of the numbers delete all the numbers after the tenths decimal place this number is your handicap index 4 x research source there are maximum default handicap indexes and they are 36 4 for males on an 18 hole course 40 4 for females on an 18 hole course 18 2 for males on a nine hole course 20 2 for females on a nine hole course multiply your handicap index by the slope rating now that you have your handicap index this portable number can be taken to any course and used to calculate your course handicap for any set of tees again the slope rating should be listed on your score card at the clubhouse or on the course s website divide the product by the standard slope rating this is an average difficulty rating for courses and the usga has determined that this average slope is 113 5 x research source so after you multiply your handicap index by the slope rating divide it by 113 find your course handicap round that number to the nearest whole number any number ending in 4 or below is rounded down and any number ending in 5 or above is rounded up this rounded whole number is your course handicap,Sports-and-Fitness
how to decorate golf balls,decorating golf balls is an activity that can be fun for adults and children alike whether you re making a gift for the golfer in your life or accenting your home décor you can use golf balls for original artwork by adding designs with permanent marker or with paint you can also use red black and white paint to enhance your garden with golf ball ladybugs,choose a design there are a lot of designs to choose from floral patterns are an easy fun and cute pattern to draw if you re new to decorating golf balls you could also recreate the solar system or make minions and popular characters you have endless options so come up with a plan for how you will want your golf balls to look some creative ideas include fruit bugs and animals holiday themes and other types of sports balls like soccer and basket balls 1 x research source gather golf balls and markers use quality permanent markers that won t easily rub or wash off and won t fade over time choose an array of colors for color that stands out brightest on turf look for reds and yellows 2 x research source gather a lot of golf balls as you work you may want to discard some that you don t like or you may come up with new designs that you want to try along the way try as many different designs and illustrations as you like place all materials in a cardboard box or other flat surface where the balls will not roll away wash the golf balls thoroughly with dish soap place them in a sink and scrub them with hot soapy water to remove dirt or other elements from the surface dry them off with a dish towel before drawing on them with permanent marker 3 x research source draw lines around the golf ball set the golf ball on a flat surface and hold the marker steady with the tip touching the ball slowly roll the golf ball for a straight line going all the way around the ball then move the marker to the next point on the ball where you want to draw another line 4 x research source lines can be decorative by themselves or they can be used as stems for flowers in a floral pattern use different colors for a specific theme for example use red and green for a christmas themed design or black and yellow to make the golf ball look like a bumblebee make a floral pattern on the ball color in the ridges on the ball with the tip of the marker you can make a flower pattern by coloring in one ridge with one color and each of the surrounding ridges with a brighter color this process also works well for paw prints if you use neutral colors like black and brown color in the ridges color every other ridge for a checkered pattern or color in ridges sparingly for a polka dot pattern you can use different colors or all one color depending on how you want your pattern to look the technique is simple but the finished design will be fun to see 5 x research source you can create a great piece of home décor by coloring golf balls with simple designs and placing them in a vase or frame 6 x research source choose how you want your golf balls to look you can use acrylic paint and paint brushes or spray paint for a more solid look of one color depending on the design you may need to gather a lot of golf balls it s better to have too many golf balls than not enough as you might want to change your design along the way use as many golf balls as you need knowing what type of design you want before you start can help you decide if you want spray paint or acrylic paint and what size brushes to use set up your workspace painting golf balls is best when done outdoors due to the mess and fumes place empty egg cartons upside down outside on a flat surface then place the golf balls on the egg carton to hold them firmly in place while you re working 7 x research source sandpaper the golf balls this will remove the gloss on the outer surface of the ball so that the paint will stick better this will also help remove any dirt and grime 8 x research source add primer to the golf balls keep them on the egg cartons and spray over the golf balls with paint primer spray this will also ensure that the paint will stick and have a longer lasting hold hold away from your face as you spray and then wait for the balls to dry 9 x research source paint a solid color with spray paint you can make a ball one solid color by placing it on the empty egg carton and spraying it with spray paint once it is dry turn it over and spray the other side if you don t have spray paint you can also use a large brush to coat the balls with acrylic paint once you have a solid colored golf ball that isn t white you can continue to create designs with a more colorful background use stickers and paint to make a clean cut design stickers of stars letters flowers and other shapes will work well for designs initials or names when you place the sticker on the ball and paint over it with either a brush or spray paint allow the paint to dry before you remove stickers 10 x research source use a fine brush to draw smaller designs use the tip of a small brush to paint intricate designs or make a floral pattern by filling in the ridges with different colors do this by painting one ridge a dark neutral color and each surrounding ridge a bright color set up a workspace where you can paint outdoors is usually the best place to work due to the mess and fumes if you will be working indoors lay down newspaper and open a window lay empty egg cartons on top of the newspaper or flat surface area where you will be painting the empty egg cartons will be used to hold the golf balls while you work so that they remain steady and you can keep one hand free 11 x research source sandpaper the surface of each golf ball this will remove the gloss from the ball and any residual dirt golf balls have a layer of gloss on the surface that can keep paint from sticking so it s important to make sure all the gloss is removed after sandpapering each ball brush off any extra sand or dust spray a paint primer on the balls this is easiest to do while the balls are sitting on the upside down egg carton this will help to give the paint a better hold and will also help the colors look more vibrant allow the primer to fully dry before moving on 12 x research source coat the ball with red paint keep the balls on the egg carton while you paint you can use a large brush or for an easy and solid coating you can use spray paint allow the red paint to fully dry before adding any black this will prevent the black paint from running into the red paint and making a mess on the ball 13 x research source paint a large black circle for the head and fill it in with black paint continue to draw a line from the top of the head in a semi circle around the ball this is the line between the two wings continue to use the black paint to fill in ridges on the ball for spots 14 x research source you don t have to make a lot of black spots just a few will look great paint two small white rings inside the head of the ladybug these will be the eyes so put them towards the top half of the head close to the wings at this point the design is complete so wait for the ball to dry 15 x research source add varnish to protect your new ladybug golf balls from rain and weathering apply the varnish with a clean brush and allow it to sit once the varnish is dry you can start putting them around your garden or in your flower beds 16 x research source try to keep them in shaded areas to avoid the color from fading quickly in the sunlight,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play disc golf,disc golf was invented in california in the 1960s as a cheaper easier version of golf since then the sport has exploded with courses across the country and discs in most major sport retailers easy to pick up and play and much cheaper and faster than normal golf disc golf is a great way to get out and have some fun and exercise,grip with your four fingers under the disc and thumb near the edge on top you want a nice tight grip on the disc as you ll be ripping it out of your hands when you release the disc your four fingers should all be inside the lip on the underside of the disc your thumb is on top on the softer part of the disc and close to the edge make sure your arm and wrist are loose allowing them to move freely as you throw for precision shots some players extend their forefinger along the outside rim of the disc this lowers power but increases accuracy for some people during putts or mid range shots give yourself a 3 step run up for a drive ending on your dominant foot so if you re a righty you start your run up with the right foot square your shoulders up to the basket and work on taking three smooth steps up this is sometimes called the x step step forward with your dominant foot raising the disc to roughly chest height this is step one of a good drive if you re a righty step with the right foot and raise the disc just below your pecs as you turn your body will naturally turn away from the basket step ahead with the left foot pointing it perpendicular to the basket as you do continue rotating your body so that your back is turning towards the basket in front of you again this is for a righty this naturally coils your body back turning your shoulders hips and the disc back behind you you should end this step with the disc behind you body swiveled away from the basket think of a spring or coil being wound up ready to release with power take a final step forward shifting your weight onto this foot as your body uncoils as you take this final step let your body naturally rotate back towards your front foot keep the disc flat the other time leaving it at the same height as you started at as the disc comes around your chest your back leg will naturally pull forward and your shoulders hips and head should turn to face the basket pull the disc straight across your body as you release you don t want to arc the disc around you nor do you want to windmill or curl around the disc for a straight throw you want to pull the disc straight across your chest to do so start by pointing the disc straight ahead of you at your target with your first step pull the disc straight back as your turn for the release bend at the elbow as you pull the disc in a straight line towards the basket as you pass your chest you ll feel your elbow naturally unbending in order to keep the disc on a straight line 1 x research source throw your arm fluidly at the target releasing it when the disc points directly at the target you want to think about your power coming smoothly from your hips moving up from your footwork to your wrist a good way to think about this is by thinking about your body as it uncoils the smoother you make these motions the better your throw in order your body should rotate from the hips through the shoulders along the elbow and finally releasing with a flick of the wrist if you let your momentum carry your body around in this order your throws will be smooth and accurate this is a bit like a baseball batter uncoiling from the feet up to hit a fastball follow through with your throwing hand palm up pointing to the target and letting your body spill forward as you finish make sure you keep your palm up this will keep you from turning or spinning the disc on release which leads to inaccurate throws grow your disc collection for specific shots and properties there are thousands of discs on the market and many of them have remarkably different flight patterns each disc is made for a certain type of shot and thrower and you should experiment with different styles when shopping it is helpful to understand the basic terminology overstable means that the disc fades strongly to the left for right handed throwers and right for left handers when thrown backhand understable means that a disc fades to the right for righties and to the left for lefties when thrown backhand speed glide tells you how hard you can throw a disc to get distance on it and how long it stays in the air higher speed discs are harder to throw accurately and high glide is harder to control however when mastered you will throw for greater distances overall basic vs premium plastics determine how long a disc will last after landing hitting trees and wear and tear higher quality plastics often have better grip as well 2 x research source work on a strong flat throw for maximum distance on your backhand a long distance throw comes not from working out but from smooth consistent technique the best advice is to keep your disc flat or perpendicular to the ground as the disc rises it catches more wind and almost always hooks off heading sharply to the left with right handers when releasing focus on keeping the nose of the disc down 10 20 feet off the ground generally leads to the best throws if the nose is up the disc usually rises and then breaks hard down to the left for righties angle the disc to curve it around tricky objects curving in disc golf is called hyzer and it is accomplished depending on the angle of the disc knowing these terms and how to accomplish each type of throw greatly increases your skills and shots on the links all of these descriptions are for a right handed thrower but easily reverse for lefties hyzer when the outside edge is lower than your grip tilting the disc to the left this makes the disc curve left when thrown anhyzer when the grip edge is lower than the outer edge tilting the disc to the right this makes the disc curve to the right s curve throwing a nose up anhyzer throw remember that a nose up disc breaks left near the end but an anhyzer breaks right in the beginning this lets you get a curvy s shaped path if you can pull it off understand that you don t always want to approach the disc straight on learning to hone your hyzers in combination with your throwing angle separates the pros from amateurs note how your drives normally break and compensate accordingly need to curve the disc left start on the back left of the tee and approach diagonally to the upper right still aiming towards the basket this will naturally tilt your disc slightly need to get the disc up high like up a hill this will point your nose up which drags the shot left approach diagonally towards the right to compensate focus on technique not full power to throw it further it seems paradoxical but most disc golfers note that they hit longer drives when they use only 80 of their power focusing the rest of their energy on perfect technique trying to throw too hard usually leads to tense muscles which greatly impacts your accuracy the number one indicator of disc distance is the arm speed used to throw this is important to note as speed is usually a factor of form having a relaxed but concise throwing motion without locking up or getting tense and not a factor of pure strength learn other types of throws to greatly increase your range the backhand throw will suffice for 90 of your shots if not more but that doesn t mean you can t extend your shot selection to hit tricky angles some of the most common other shots include forehand instead of turning your body in then uncoiling you point with your non throwing foot then follow through across your body this has less power but reverses your normal curve on the shot making it a good way to get a hook or slice without trying having to point the nose in a remarkably different angle 3 x research source hammer throw you throw the disc overhand up high releasing with a snap of the wrist as the disc gets above your head hold the disc like normal and bring it back behind your head turning it so that the top of the disc points to the ground with a short overhand throw like you were throwing a hammer toss the disc up keeping the top of the disc pointed to the ground this leads to a short straight and high shot perfect for getting over an obstacle right in front of you 4 x research source get yourself a basic set of 1 3 discs an initial set usually consists of a driver a mid range and a putter there are a few select courses that have pro shops some that even rent discs however this is the exception and not the rule so it is advised to find a local retailer dick s and sam s each carry discs or purchase a beginner s set online you should get three discs midrange cover everything in between your drive and final putt if you re only looking to get one disc get a midrange like the roc or the buzzcraft they are shaped like normal frisbees easy to throw and stay relatively straight if offered aim for a stability rating at or below 1 0 drivers have a sharp pointed rim they go the farthest but are the hardest to keep accurate again beginners should aim for a stable basic driver to begin with do not get an overstable driver to begin these tend to curve harshly putters are soft and round they glide well but don t throw incredibly far allowing your to drift towards the basket without overshooting find a course near you by looking at parks campgrounds campuses and rec centers most disc golf courses are free to play and almost none require calling or reserving ahead of time if you re unsure about the courses near you check out dg course review com a user made website listing all known courses along with ratings maps pictures and even some shot recommendations for tricky holes when you arrive look to see if there is a course map and grab one now courses aren t always well mapped if there is only a single map take a picture with your phone start each shot on the flat tee at the beginning of each hole on some courses there will be multiple tees depending on your skill level with those closer to the hole made for beginners and those far away for advanced players before shooting note the location of your basket by consulting the diagram near the tee dg courses can be tight leading to basket confusion if you re unsure of the hole take every shot within one step of where the last shot landed you can change discs every shot but you must stay within a pace of your disc usually this means leaving your back foot near the disc then leaning either way if you need help to get around an object you can take a run up to any shot but you must release the disc within a food of where the last shot landed note the out of bounds ob areas on each hole adding a stroke if the disc lands here if there are hole diagrams at the tee they will indicate where is ob water is considered ob as well so if you sink a disc you must add a stroke to your current hole if you retrieve a disc from ob you take your next throw from the closest in bounds areas to where your disc sailed out of bounds it should be the closest open area but you should not move any closer to the hole than the spot where you went ob 5 x research source finish the hole by landing the disc in the cage at the bottom of the basket you do not simply need to hit the chains although they do help drop the disc into the hole the disc must land in the cage in the basket in order to be counted add up the number of throws you took to hit the basket to your score keeping track of each hole these are called strokes and they work just like normal golf every throw equals one stroke and the lowest score wins so if you took four throws to finish a hole then you have four strokes if the next hole takes you three strokes your score is now seven remember to add strokes for ob or water traps so if you take four throws to hit the basket but one of them went ob then the hole took five strokes determine throwing order by the lowest score on the previous holes whoever won the previous hole throws first on the next one if there is a tie then the player with the lowest total score throws next if there is still a tie then alternate players with the first throw until someone takes the lead 7 x research source crown the winner as the person who took the least total strokes throughout the course just like golf you want to have the lowest score in order to win this simply means it took the winner fewer throws than everyone else to complete the same holes making them the day s leader 8 x research source remain courteous helpful and clean to keep our free courses open to the public disc golf is an amazingly community driven sport most courses are free because people volunteer to keep them clean and playable and users share the course graciously never act like you own the course and always remember to share the inclusive kind and diy spirit that makes the sport so special by keeping quiet especially when others are throwing letting faster groups of players play through by waiting one hole for them to pass you pick up trash and respect local trees plants and wildlife communicate when disc may hit someone and stand behind throwers whenever possible 9 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to improve your golf game,whether you re a professional or a beginner anyone can enjoy a game of golf golf is a great way to relieve stress and stay athletic no matter experienced you are it is great to make efforts to get better at golf to improve your game improve your form learn golfing techniques and keep some strategies in mind,anchor your foot one of the most basic tips to get greater distance is to anchor firmly press into the ground your foot and your body behind the ball the foot you must anchor is the foot that is behind the ball for right handed players it will be the right foot and the left foot for left handed players if you lift your foot too soon when swinging the club you will lose power and distance in the shot 1 x research source touch your elbow to your hip if you can t touch your elbow to your hip at least keep your arm close to your hip by keeping the right arm close to the hip you ensure the body will drive your arms and club through the ball impact this will decrease the chances of your hands negatively influencing the shot 2 x research source keep your left arm close to your hip if you re left handed relax your muscles relax and keep your grip light at the top of your backswing make a slight pause and maintain a light grip through the swing to keep a light grip relax the muscles in your forearms and also your fingers if you do this you will create a faster brisker swing release through the ball impact this will result in a longer drive 3 x research source take deep even breaths to help relax rotate your hips vigorously by energetically rotating you hips on the downswing you will bring your core muscles into play this will increase club head speed and therefore will result in a longer drive make sure you do this in a controlled manner keep your foot anchored to prevent slicing the ball 4 x research source slicing the ball is when the golf ball curves dramatically from the left to the ball after a shot use a short controlled backswing do this to achieve a longer drive a common failure amongst golfers is bringing the driver too far back during the backswing this causes a loss in control of the club a powerful more controlled swing can achieved by controlling your wrists and rotating your body into the shot thus resulting in a more distance your hands should be level with your shoulders when you bring the club back let the club do the work a common misconception amongst golfers is that the harder they whack the ball the further it will go you should actually focus on the middle of the ball and the control you have over your swing this will give you far better results than trying to increase the power of your swing hitting the ball too hard will invariably mean a slice or a fresh air shot 5 x research source don t rush the shot try not to tense up before making the shot concentrate on controlling your swing and the club will do the rest for you once you have mastered controlling your golf swing you can then gradually increase the power you use when driving the ball 6 x research source instead of muscling the shot use your left hand to control the club during the swing use your right hand if you re left handed visualize the shot when taking your practice swings imagine the shot you wish to hit picture the ball s flight when you make your practice swing make sure your swing feels comfortable this technique will relax your body as well as your mind also never take too many practice swings as the thought of fluffing the shot will build up in your mind and affect your confidence 7 x research source reduce spinning by teeing the ball higher hit the drives with minimal spin on the ball to achieve this you can tee the ball up high this will promote less spin on the ball as you will be hitting it from a more underneath position also try to avoid moving forward over the ball on impact this will always reduce spin 8 x research source practice as often as possible consistency in the amount of times you get out there and play is crucial to a good game to hone your golfing skills you must play regularly you will not improve if you don t practice you will learn to tweak your game a little bit more each time you play and bring the lessons you learned the previous week to the course with you the following week 9 x research source choose a good set of clubs even for professionals the type of clubs used matters the type of clubs you choose depends on if you re at a beginner intermediate or advanced level a set of three woods and eight irons is sufficient if you re a beginner most club sets will work for a beginner make sure the clubs fit your strength and posture once you reach the intermediate level a good set of clubs are ones that have been fitted for you 10 x research source sometimes bigger clubs are better because it means greater inertia choose a good ball you can use any type of ball but some balls are better than others you want a ball that will go the farthest distance yardage is more important than spin look for a ball that is not too light or heavy 11 x research source ask for the advice of an employee at your local sports equipment store if you re not sure which golf balls to choose it s not necessary to go for the most expensive option if you re just playing for fun 12 x research source take lessons taking golf lessons is a sure way to improve your game they are especially helpful for beginners golf lessons can help you learn etiquette improve technique learn technical aspects and familiarize yourself with your equipment this however may not work for everyone because lessons can be costly 13 x research source you can sign up for golf lessons at country clubs gold academies and from private instructors keep fit as with any game you need a certain level of fitness to maintain the ability to play well to keep fit you can stretch go to the gym and or enjoy any other physical activity stretch your hamstrings quads arms and back before playing try to go to the gym at least twice a week for physical activities you can run do yoga or play other sports 14 x research source only do as much physical activity outside of

how to hit the driver longer,driving a golf ball as far as you can while maintaining accuracy is a great way to lower your score and get better as a golfer getting distance on the ball is as much about fundamentals and mechanics as it is about power and strength even the best of the best need constant practice to drive the ball as far they can once you nail the basics you ll be ready to set new personal records for driving a golf ball,tee the ball higher than normal to optimize your launch angle this allows you to get a good launch angle on the ball you want to get under the golf ball and let it get some air to maximize the distance if you have a 2 75 in 7 0 cm tee set it up so that only the bottom 0 25 inches 0 64 cm of it are in the ground 1 x research source tee heights range from 2 25 4 inches 5 7 10 2 cm but the most common size is 2 75 inches 7 0 cm whichever type of tee you use make sure only the bottom 0 25 inches 0 64 cm are in the ground widen your stance to sweep the ball off the tee you ll feel more stable and can generate more power on the swing without losing your balance the wider stance also puts your front shoulder lower than your back shoulder which makes it easier to sweep the ball off the tee 2 x research source hitting the ball on the upswing will launch the ball higher without giving it backspin this is ideal for more distance place the ball forward in your stance to generate power behind it if you re a righty this means the tee should be just inside your left heel once you do this place 60 of your weight on your right side to give your body the needed tilt to launch the ball upwards your spine should lean slightly to your right 3 x research source lefties should place 60 of their weight on their left side synchronize your hands and arms with your core your body should move in one fluid motion to get the perfect swing good synchronization starts with the first few feet of the swing which leads to a smooth backswing and solid contact keep your right glute and quad firm to prevent your backswing from going back too far 4 x research source once your back hip stops turning you ve reached the top of your backswing shift the majority of your weight to your front foot for righties this means moving your weight from your right foot to your left foot by the time you hit the ball the majority of your weight should be on that front foot if your weight has not shifted properly the ball s distance and accuracy will suffer 5 x research source shift your weight in a fluid motion if you find yourself hesitating stop your swing and restart again after a taking a break for a few seconds stay loose and relaxed as you shift your weight if your body tightens up you won t be able to generate enough power to drive the ball as long as you d like your elbows and knees should be loose not locked up 6 x research source before you swing take a few deep breaths as a way to keep yourself loose but focused accelerate your swing right as you reach the ball to keep your power many amateur golfers use up so much energy early in the swing that they don t have enough speed to drive through the ball and send it as far as they want if you try to swing at full speed from the top of your backswing you re going to slow down once you reach the ball to make sure the club is moving fastest when it impacts the ball begin to speed up the swing when the club is in line with your back leg 7 x research source a clubhead accelerating is not gradual it happens incredibly fast so the more swings you take off the tee the more control you ll have when you drive the ball keep the clubface stable to ensure solid contact the toe of the club moves faster than the heel which is why it s so important to keep your hands arms and core synced up if your body isn t lined up you could hit the ball with the outside of the clubface and make weak contact the faster you move through your shot the more stability you ll have 8 x research source constant practicing is the best way to increase the length of your drives work on each part of your swing individually to nail the motion spend a few minutes working on the perfect stance for you then practice your backswing by itself and keep track of when your back hip stops so you know when to begin bringing the club forward finally work on shifting your weight and following through with the swing 9 x research source spend an equal amount of time on each part of your swing allot 15 minutes for the backswing weight shift and follow through to build good habits take swings without a ball to practice you can do this in your garage or in a different part of your home with ample space try to get to the point where your swing looks the exact same every single time so repeat your swing until you feel comfortable with it 10 x research source make sure there s nothing in your swing path that s in your way if the weather is good practice these swings outside go to your local driving range to hit a bucket of balls there s nothing like hitting a bunch of golf balls to really nail down your swing head to a driving range that s close to you and rent a bucket of golf balls the nice part about going to the range is it s pretty cheap as a bucket of balls shouldn t cost more than 8 10 dollars 11 x research source there s no rush when it comes to practicing on the driving range so take your time swinging your driver over and over again in rapid succession doesn t let you focus on getting the swing as good as it can be take short breaks every so often to let your body and mind regroup,Sports-and-Fitness

research source understanding the game can help you think like a player so you can design courses they will want to play on develop the necessary skills while your education is important there are other skills that will help you succeed as a golf course designer you will need to have problem solving skills along with analytical skills this helps solve any problems you encounter as you design and work around limitations of construction materials and the landscape 6 x research source you also need to have good written and verbal communication skills as a golf course designer you will be communicating with administrators government officials bureaucrats and others connected to your project computer and technology skills are also important since you will be working with various technological devices learn to use software related to landscape design software is a major part of golf course design you will need to become familiar with computer aided design cad software you will also be using graphics software while building your courses basic knowledge of these types of programs is important 7 x research source many landscape architecture programs offer classes in computer design and 3 d modeling you can also learn to use these programs on your own time take the landscape architect registration examination this test is offered by the council of landscape architectural registration boards it contains four sections aimed at testing your knowledge skills and abilities you must pass all four sections to receive your license 8 x research source section 1 covers project and construction management section 2 covers inventory and analysis section 3 is design and section 4 deals with grading drainage and construction documentation you can take the sections at different times it is suggested to take sections 1 and 2 close to your graduation date and wait to take section 4 after a few years of practical experience get your landscape architectural license licensure is required for a landscape architect working in the united states unless they work for the government requirements vary by state but generally demand a combination of work experience and education from

how to hit a normal pitch shot,the pitch shot is a short approach shot which goes up in the air first and then lands without moving forward too much the pitch shot can vary in length from anywhere between 50 yards 45 7 m to nearly 90 100 yards 82 3 91 4 m this shot is mostly used to get the ball to fly over bunkers or water hazards which are guarding the green hitting a pitch shot to a well bunkered green can be intimidating for many players read on to find out an effective method,make sure you either use a pitching wedge or a sand wedge to practice your pitching with these have lots of loft if the ball doesn t go as far as you would like it to then you could also use a 9 iron hit down on the ball to get the ball up in the air make sure that when you address the ball the end of the grip or the butt of the club as it s called is pointing left of your belly button and the ball is positioned opposite your left breast with a slight lean of the shaft towards the target you will be able to hit down on the ball much easier than if the end of the club was leaning away from the target or more towards your right leg on the backswing create a good 90 degree angle between the left arm and the shaft of the club as soon as possible try to get the clubhead higher than the hands as early as possible then when you swing the club back to the ball try to hit down on the ball with the shaft leaning towards the target the law of opposites will come to your rescue if you can remember to hit down on the ball then the ball will go up in the air if on the other hand you try to scoop or lift the ball up into the air the ball will not go up rather it will go down at impact you should try to keep both arms fairly straight until you feel yourself being pulled round towards the target try to move the club and arms together let the body respond to what the arms do provided you have a good posture your weight shift will go over to the inside of your right foot and then when you start to swing back towards the target you should find your weight going over onto the left leg try not to force your body into the shot if you find your body moving too much during the swing simply try to swing the arms faster this will at least give you a better chance of maintaining your balance you should find your shots flying up in the air and hopefully landing on the green keep practicing and hit it with passion,Sports-and-Fitness
how to design a golf course in your backyard,are you obsessed with golf or do you like designing and architecture these things come hand in hand when designing a golf course,think about how much time and space you have it will be more work than you think to design the course maintain it and depending on how complex it is you may not be able to tear it down if you don t want it anymore you will need a fairly large backyard in order to do this of course it s just going to be one hole it s not an entire nine or eighteen hole course start with the equipment make sure you have a pitching wedge sand wedge and a putter these are the only clubs you will really need if you re just golfing in your backyard make sure to have multiple balls since you may lose some also make sure you have a good grass mower that can cut the grass nice and short decide what kind of ground you will have the course on if you own a very large piece of land and are willing to spend lots of time maintaining the course maybe you could make a par four or five but if you just have an average big backyard it should be a par three definitely make sure that on the land you are designing the course on that it is rather flat and not too bumpy that is it doesn t have many hills or slopes if you have a fairly sized backyard your course should be about 15 yards 13 7 m long mow the fairway it would be neat to mow every other row so it s striped like a real fairway you should mow the fairway every 3 4 days depending on how big your backyard is you should make the fairway about 8 10 feet 2 4 3 0 m across make sure the grass around the fairway is rather long 3 4 in so you have a rough also always make sure the fairway is a little longer than the green mow the green to mow the green set your mower blades to the lowest setting so the grass is extra short try to place the green on the flattest surface of your yard you should mow the green every 2 days sort of try to line the green up with the fairway but don t connect the fairway and green directly leave a few feet in between for the rough the green should be depending on the size of your course roughly around 8 feet 2 4 m x 8 feet 2 4 m try to make the green about the same width as the fairway create 2 3 sand traps hazards buy 2 3 large sandbags at a hardware store you shouldn t need any more than three sand traps throughout your course try to have at least one along the side of the fairway and at least one in front behind or alongside the green the sand traps should be no bigger than 5 feet 1 5 m x 5 feet 1 5 m while sand traps are not necessarily they make a good touch and reputation for a golf course finally maintain your course at real courses they have crews come out every day to maintain the courses while you may not need to mow your course every day just every 3 4 days just take about 15 20 minutes from your day to check up on your course invite some friends over to play together this will make it a lot more fun,Sports-and-Fitness
how to chip a golf ball a precise distance,a chip shot is the perfect thing to use when you re stuck in the sand or need to clear rough grass to get to the green this specialty shot will cause the golf ball to go 1 5 yards 0 91 4 57 m in the air before landing if you want your chip shots to go near the intended area on the green you ll need to learn how to properly execute the shot and practice using it to hit the ball varying distances if you follow the right technique and continue practicing you can improve your chip shot and control how far it goes,plant your feet on the ground with your toes facing the golf tee stand 1 2 ft 0 30 0 61 m away from the golf tee position your feet so that they are parallel with each other and square your shoulders hold the handle on your club firmly with both hands and angle the club out in front of you 1 x research source you should feel comfortable and natural bend forward slightly at the waist bend at your knees and waist and square your shoulders line up your waist and spine with the ball while you position your golf club behind the golf tee 2 x research source fight any urge you have to lean backward when chipping the ball because it often leads to wide shots or shots that get too much air 3 x research source bring the club up behind you bend your non dominant wrist and your back arm slightly at the elbow while you bring the club back keep your leading arm as straight as possible while you swing the club in the backward motion 4 x research source for chip shots you ll only need to bring the club back 1 5 2 ft 0 46 0 61 m don t bring the club too far back or you ll hit the ball too hard and the direction will be unpredictable swing the club forward and hit the ball swing the club in a slightly downward direction hit the ball before the club makes contact with the grass for a clean shot 5 x research source if done correctly the ball should jump up over whatever obstruction is in your way 6 x research source it s normal for the club to hit the grass after it hits the ball it may take several tries before you make contact with the ball use a 6 iron for low terrain chip shots if you need to chip the ball over low terrain a 6 iron is the best club to use a ball hit by a 6 iron will roll a lot after they land so you ll want your ball to land 10 30 yards 9 1 27 4 m away from the intended target 7 x research source if you try to chip shot with a 6 iron too close to the hole it may roll past the hole the amount that the ball rolls after it lands will depend on how hard you hit the ball use a 9 iron to get more air than a 6 iron if you have to go over a lot of rough grass a 9 iron is the best club to use a ball hit by a 9 iron will also roll a good distance after it lands aim your shot for the front of the green and let the ball roll towards the intended area 8 x research source a ball hit by a 9 iron will go 3 5 yd 2 7 4 6 m in the air use a sand wedge when the ball is stuck in the sand sand wedges are bigger clubs that give the golf ball more air than if you used a 9 or 6 iron in addition a ball hit by a sand wedge won t roll as much use a sand wedge if you re stuck in a bunker or need to make a chip shot that stops quickly 9 x research source when using a sand wedge aim the ball as close to the target as you can use more power to make your shot travel further bring your club back further during your backswing and swing harder to put more power into your chip shot hitting the ball hard will result in a far shot that will get a lot of air 10 x research source if you need to clear an obstruction that is 3 5 yd 2 7 4 6 m long use a longer backswing and put more power in your shot use less power if you don t need the ball to travel far if you need the ball to clear a smaller obstruction reduce the distance of your backswing and put less power into your forward swing less power in your swing will also reduce the amount that the ball rolls after landing 11 x research source if you need to clear an obstruction that is 1 2 yd 0 91 1 83 m long you may want to use less power and put less backswing on your shot practice putting the ball to get a feeling for the green the grain of the green will affect how and where your ball rolls practice hitting a couple of balls in the center of the putting green then work your way to the fringes of the course 12 x research source practice chipping balls in the sand make sure to get out of the way if someone is golfing behind you set up indicators 30 60 and 90 yd 27 55 and 82 m away find an area where you can set up cones or ribbons to indicate 30 60 and 90 yd 27 55 and 82 m set up the markers somewhere off the golfing green use these indicators to practice hitting balls a specific distance 13 x research source you can also set up a practice range in your backyard if you don t have access to a golf course try chipping to each marker practice hitting the ball to the 30 yd 27 m marker at first adjust the power and angle of your swing until you get the feeling for the 30 yd 27 m marker once you re confident move to the 60 yd 55 m marker and then finally the 90 yd 82 m marker 14 x research source with enough practice and repetition you ll be able to hit precise chip shots when golfing,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hold a putter,when it comes to holding a putter there is no definitively correct technique golfers at all levels struggle to find the right grip and many change the way they hold a putter many times before settling on a technique 1 x research source while the standard reverse overlap crosshand and claw grips are the most common ways to hold a putter you can also experiment with less common techniques to find the right grip for you the key to successfully holding a putter is to try out various techniques and find a grip that is comfortable feels natural and consistently enables you to get the ball in the hole,hold the handle of the putter with your left hand near the top of the club your fingers should wrap around the bottom of the club while your thumb rests on top facing down towards the bottom of the handle make sure that your thumb rests flatly on top of the handle wrap the fingers on your right hand around the bottom of the handle just below your left hand rest your right thumb on top facing the same direction as your left thumb your right thumb should rest just below your left thumb and about 2 inches 5 1 cm to 4 inches 10 cm above the bottom of the handle overlap your hands by lifting the index finger on your left hand and wrapping it over the pinky finger on your right hand let your index finger on your left hand settle in between the pinky finger and ring finger on your right hand wiggle your hands to tighten your hold slightly and adjust until you settle into a comfortable grip also referred to as the traditional grip this is the most popular technique for gripping a putter for a long time this grip was the accepted standard and is still used by most top golfers today 2 x research source trying out the reverse overlap is a good place to start because for most golfers this grip will be the preferred technique if you are left handed begin with your right hand wrapped around the top of the handle then place your left hand just below your right hand and wrap your fingers around the bottom resting your thumb on top lift your left index finger and place it over your left pinky to link your hands whether you are left or right handed it is important that your thumbs face down the handle and lay flat this will help you keep the putter square as you swing and make contact with the ball 3 x research source wrap your right hand around the handle towards the top of the club the fingers on your right hand should wrap under the bottom of the handle rest your right thumb flatly on top the exact placement of your top hand will vary depending on your personal preference to start try placing your right hand so that your thumb rests about 3 inches 7 6 cm from the top of the club place your left hand just below your right hand and wrap your fingers around the bottom rest your left thumb on flatly top make sure that your thumb points down towards the bottom of the handle of the putter lift your right index finger and place it over your left pinky to link your hands let the index finger on your right hand settle in between the pinky finger and ring finger on your left hand wiggle your hands to adjust your hold until you settle into a comfortable grip if you are left handed begin by holding the handle of the putter with your left hand near the top wrap the fingers on your right hand around the handle just below your left hand and rest your thumb on top overlap your hands by lifting the index finger on your left hand and wrapping it over the pinky finger on your right hand this grip is popular because unlike the reverse overlap the crosshand s hand positioning forces your shoulders to level out making it easier to keep the club moving after you make contact with the ball and hopefully making your putting more accurate 4 x research source hold the handle of the putter with your left hand towards the top of the club wrap your fingers around the bottom of the club and rest your left thumb flatly on top pointing down towards the bottom of the handle the placement and grip of your left hand should be the same as in the reverse overlap grip place your right hand loosely around the club just below your left hand before you grip the handle flip your hand under the putter and grip so that your thumb rests under the handle your fingers should be pointing down the club and away from your body rest your fingers on the club place your right index finger on top of the club and your other fingers comfortably on the side your right index finger should rest in line with your left thumb for left handed golfers wrap your left hand around the handle at the top of the club and rest your thumb flatly on top flip your left hand under the putter and grip so that your left thumb rests under the handle place your left fingers on the club so that your left index finger rests on top of the club in line with your right thumb and the rest of your fingers are placed on the side once considered an example of what not to do the claw is now one of the two most popular alternatives to the traditional reverse overlap while many golfers find that the claw grip feels a bit awkward it is a great option to try if the reverse overlap and the crosshand don t feel natural or comfortable unlike other popular ways to hold a putter your fingers do not overlap in the claw grip 5 x research source overlap your hands more for an adjusted reverse overlap or crosshand grip instead of simply overlapping your index finger of the hand at the top of the handle over the pinky finger of the hand below it try putting your index finger over two or even three of your fingers on the bottom hand this tighter version of the reverse overlap grip or crosshand grip might be more comfortable and give you more control over your putter while less common than a standard reverse overlap or crosshand grip an adjusted reverse overlap or crosshand grip can be more effective when the green is overgrown or rough 6 x research source try an adjusted claw grip by moving your claw hand further down the shaft separating your hands enables you to hold the putter steady if you feel that the standard claw grip is too loose set up your grip as you would in a standard claw grip then move your bottom hand down the shaft of the club until you find a spot that feels comfortable you can even move your bottom hand down below the handle of the club though this can be harder to comfortably grip use a reverse overlap style grip and split your hands as you would in the claw grip combining elements of these two popular techniques might be more comfortable and enable you to feel more in control if overlapping the index finger of the hand at the top of the club in a reserve overlap or crosshand grip does not work for you this less common but still effective adjustment could be the best way for you to hold a putter and find success,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hit a golf ball farther,every golfer dreams of hitting the ball farther on the course to improve their game and reduce the number of strokes they have if you want to increase the distance the ball travels during your game then you first need to look at your swing posture to determine if it s causing any of the problems once you perfect your swing practice using woods and irons to see how they affect your form and distance if you re still looking to get more power then you can exercise to build muscle and stamina so you play a great round of golf,keep your club fully extended in front of you place the head of the club behind the ball and hold the grip near the end of the shaft walk backward away from the ball until your arms are nearly straight and so the club head doesn t move keep your feet slightly wider than your hips so the ball is either in the middle of your feet or closer to your front foot 1 x research source standing farther away from the ball increases the distance the club head travels which allows it to build up more speed and power when you take your shot relax your shoulders before you start your swing tight shoulders limit the amount of power you can get during your swing since it restricts your range of motion if you feel tense around your shoulders let your arms hang down and shake them slightly to remove any of the tension keep your shoulder muscles relaxed while you re preparing your swing so you can reach your full power during your backswing 2 x research source sometimes a tight grip on the club can make you tense up your shoulders try letting go of the club and grabbing it again slightly looser loosen your grip on the club so you aren t too tight a tight grip can make your arms and shoulders tense and restrict your range of motion while you re swinging let go of the golf club and reposition your hands on the grips squeeze the club loosely so it s secure in your hands but not so tight that your arms have tension practice a slow backswing to see if the club moves or shifts at all 3 x research source if the grips on your clubs are worn out replace them so you don t have to hold onto your club as tightly twist your hips to bring the club back as far as you can on your backswing keep your eye on the ball as you rotate your hips and shoulders away from the hole bring your front shoulder directly below your head so your chest and hips point away from the direction you re hitting the ball bring the club back behind your head as far as you re comfortably able to get your full range of motion 4 x research source keep your feet firmly planted on the ground during your backswing since it could affect your overall posture while you re practicing stop at the top of your backswing to see where the club head is positioned make sure it s near parallel to the ground shift your weight to your front foot as you make your forward swing your body weight will be focused on your rear leg while you re at the peak of your backswing as soon as you start bringing the club forward again transfer your weight to your front foot by rotating your hips toward the hole push down on your front foot slightly to help give you more power 6 x research source your forward swing should only be slightly faster than your backswing don t go too slow or else your movements will be jerky and the ball won t go where you want it hit the ball with the center of the club face to get the best impact when your ball hits a different part of the club head it may go in a different direction than you intended and only get a fraction of the power keep the club straight while you bring it forward so it makes contact with the ball in the center continue swinging forward through the ball so the club carries it forward and gets the most power 7 x research source avoid pulling the club up or leaning back when you swing forward since you may accidentally hit the ball lower on the head than you want it may take a bit of practice to consistently hit the ball in the center of your club spend some time at a driving range to practice swinging through with each club you have use a driver with a higher loft to keep the ball in the air longer the loft is the angle of the club head and affects the direction and the amount of time the ball flies look on the shaft or the club head to find the loft angle and choose a driver that has an 11 or 12 degree loft when you re first starting so your ball stays in the air longer after your swing try a few different lofts while you re choosing a driver to see how it affects the distance of your drive 8 x research source the loft near the top of the club head may be greater than the center which can help increase the distance of your shot for example a driver with an 11 degree loft in the center may be closer to a 15 degree angle near the top tee the ball up higher to get less backspin place the head of your driver on the ground so you can see how tall it is compared to your tee and ball place the tee in the ground so half of the ball extends past the top of the head that way as you swing you hit near the top center of the head and get the best power from your shot and prevent backspin which can make your ball bounce backward when it lands 9 x research source keep the ball lined up with your front foot when you set up the shot keep the club fully extended in front of you while you re lining up your shot and make sure your shoulders point in the direction where you want the ball to go position your front foot so it s at about a 40 degree angle toward the hole and stand so the ball lines up with your toes 10 x research source keeping your foot slightly angled toward the hole will help you rotate your hips farther so you get more power and distance from your swing avoid rushing your forward swing to get better control over the club keep your eye on the ball throughout your entire swing so you don t miss it begin your backswing as normal so the club is behind your head and parallel to the ground when you start your forward swing bring the club down so your arms stay straight and maintain a steady comfortable speed follow through with completely with your swing to get the most loft and contact with the ball 11 x research source rushing through your swing can affect your posture and cause you to hit the ball with the wrong part of the club head position the ball inside your front foot while you re swinging stand back from the ball so the club is fully extended in front of you and your arms are straight keep your feet shoulder width apart and at a 90 degree angle from the hole stand behind the ball so it s either centered between your feet or so the ball is slightly inside from your front foot 12 x research source point your shoulders in the direction you want the ball to go to help guide its path square the club face to the ball to make full contact with the ball irons have more loft than drivers but they tend to get more vertical height than distance while you re holding the club behind the ball check that the bottom of the club points straight ahead so you don t hit the ball at an angle hold the shaft of the club slightly toward your front shoulder to help decrease the loft of the club so your ball travels straighter 13 x research source it may feel unnatural at first to hold your club toward the front of your body but continue practicing your swing so it feels comfortable point the club face toward the sky on the farthest point of your backswing as you bring your club behind your head during the backswing make sure the club is near parallel to the ground to get the maximum range of motion lift your head and look at the club head to make sure the face points flat toward the sky this way you can ensure that the club will come back down straight and hit the ball in the center of the face 14 x research source only check the direction of the club face while you re first practicing your shots otherwise you can throw off your rhythm or miss the ball during your forward swing hinge your back wrist forward as soon as you make contact with the ball keep your arms straight and wrists locked during your forward swing so the club comes down through its full range of motion as soon as you hit the ball snap your back wrist forward to help scoop the ball off the ground and get more power in your shot follow through with your swing entirely to ensure the shot goes as far as possible 15 x research source don t break your wrist too early or else you may not hit the ball or it won t go as far as you want it to work on wood chops to mimic a golf swing motion hold an 8 10 pounds 3 6 4 5 kg dumbbell in the center with both hands and stand with your feet shoulder width apart extend your arms so you re holding the weight at an angle above your right shoulder keep your core tight as you bring the weight down across your body toward your left foot until you re in a squatting position lift the weight back up above your right shoulder to complete a repetition 16 x research source aim to do about 2 3 sets of 15 20 reps increase the number of reps you perform when you start feeling comfortable with the exercise rather than increasing the weight that way you ll tone your core and obliques more so you can repeat the movements faster and with more power do push ups or sit ups to improve your core muscles your core provides a lot of the power in your golf swing so it s important to work it out practice doing 10 15 push ups at a time to activate your core back and arms for a good all around workout if you want to only focus on your core muscles try sets of 15 20 sit ups as you get more comfortable increase the speed and number of repetitions you do to continue building power 17 x research source if you want a more difficult exercise get in a sit up position and lift your shoulders off the ground to activate your core kick your legs like you re riding a bicycle and rotate your upper body to touch your knee with the opposite elbow try squats to build muscle in your legs stand with your legs so they re about shoulder width apart and so your back is straight bend your legs and lower your body until your knees are at a 90 degree angle making sure your feet are flat on the ground hold the position for 1 count before raising yourself to the starting position continue doing squats until you complete 2 3 sets of 15 20 reps 18 x research source after you feel comfortable doing bodyweight squats start to incorporate dumbbells to help build more muscle most of your power during your golf swing comes from your lower body practice cardio exercises to boost your stamina while playing your swing may get worse the longer amount of time you spend playing your round if you notice your swing gets worse over time work on building your stamina by going for a jog riding a bike or running on a treadmill continue your cardio exercises at least 2 3 times per week for at least 30 minutes at a time 19 x research source do your cardio training for a longer amount of time rather than increasing your speed once you feel comfortable that way you ll feel comfortable through an entire golf game,Sports-and-Fitness
how to play urban golf,too broke to pay for green fees too far from a green tired of seeing golf courses being carved out of pristine earth and being watered by precious fast depleting resources or do you just want to have some fun in the city with your friends urban golf might be just the answer you re looking for it s a game of golf unrestricted by the usual rules of golf and able to be played anywhere that there s free space and not too many people about,know the rules the rules for urban golf aren t set in stone and you can modify golf rules as you wish the rules that do matter are the golden rules these are show respect don t play where it harms other people or their property if you re asked to move away by residents or police do so without being bothered don t spoil urban golf for everyone who is playing it fairly everybody sucks this is a game where anyone can join in and have fun it s not about competitiveness if it becomes about competitiveness for you you re playing the wrong golf don t be a control freak there is no leader no one person in charge who insists how the game is to be played all players have a say in the progress and outcome of the game and if you don t handle this so well again you re playing the wrong game get your supplies together you ll need a few basics some of which will fit neatly tucked into a day pack golf caddy or can be easily carried get a golf club any cheap big mart club or a club out of a friend s bag will do as long as it s fit for hitting the ball it s worthy of playing urban golf find a few balls racket balls or tennis balls are the most effective and traditional for urban golf it s not recommended to use real golf balls because they re hard and can break things if you are a better player there are off course golf balls that don t break windows or dent cars that are new to urban golf callaway makes a mediocre one but the best is an almost golf ball they fly true and out perform racket balls and tennis balls it s a good idea to mark each ball for each player so that every player knows which balls belong to which player have a few extras in case some end up down a drain pipe or somewhere else you can t retrieve them from it s a good idea to have at least three balls per player make or download a scorecard to keep scores either write down the scores as you go on a piece of paper or use a prepared score sheet each player is responsible for keeping a tally of his or her scores or ask a player good with numbers to keep the tally honesty is essential you re all friends and this is not a competition pack snacks and drinks when you get the munchies take a break and enjoy the snacks together get the players together keep the group small 10 players or less large groups become hard to manage slow down the progress of the game and can attract negative attention if things get too rowdy or out of hand of course this doesn t mean you can t have a few spectators carrying the clubs and snacks for you as long as everyone s having fun watching is fine too find a place to play this is where it can be interesting as the places to play can vary from a series of alleys and streets in an industrial section of town or on the green areas of a city park just be sure that the area is not too crowded when you want to play the tradition is to try to avoid most residential areas unless your play won t annoy residents industrial or business areas can be great on weekends when the workers aren t around and the place is deserted pick your target holes you re going to need to know what you re aiming for and this should be decided by all players the holes can be something as simple as just hitting the side of a garbage can tree rolling over a manhole or rolling under a car any round ball will roll a long way on pavement or asphalt it s going to take some getting used to space the areas far apart so that there is ample hitting space and it s reasonably difficult to get a hole in one the size of a standard city block works well as an idea for measurement choose any amount of holes that suits your needs around 9 target holes makes for an even and fun pace you can also pick spots as you go especially if you re keen to keep on the move rather than to remain in one area make sure everyone in your group is in agreement as to what the holes and course consist of before play commences commence play while there are no hard and fast rules there are some basic guidelines to put into action so that the play is enjoyable and action packed here are some suggestions and you re perfectly entitled to change any of them as long as you keep within the golden rules select the holes as suggested earlier aim for the target hole and hit the tennis ball toward it take turns in hitting the ball toward the target hole after the first tee off the player with the ball furthest away from the target hits next a successful hit for a large hole is where the ball hits the target or passes through under or in it the larger the hole the more accuracy required if it s easy to hit don t allow for near enough hits make sure they re exact for example hitting dumpsters trucks and storage sheds means actually hitting them not rolling close by a successful hit for a small or narrow hole is where the ball passes within a 3 foot 0 9 m radius or 1 club length of the small target hole for example fire hydrants manholes poles and mailboxes are harder to hit award points each normal stroke is one point and a ball has to travel a few feet to be called a stroke loss of the ball counts as a 3 point penalty resolve what to do about stuck and lost balls stuck and lost balls have the ability to slow down play and make things tedious the following suggestions will help keep the game flowing fast limit the search time for lost balls this will keep the game moving well if the ball ends up in a pothole or somewhere else challenging each player is allowed to move the ball one club length in any direction to make it easier to make the next hit the idea behind this is not to hold up the game replace a lost ball by a new ball in the place where the other ball went out of bounds finding the lost ball means that you can remove 1 5 points from your score if the ball lands anywhere that could cause damage the ball must be moved at least 3 club lengths away or more if needed to avoid harm perfect your shot remembering that the aim of the game is to have fun not be competitive and to revel in your inability there is one thing you can do to help yourself keep the game moving basically try to keep your ball low to the ground high flying balls are more easily lost and have poorly controlled trajectories that could hit something you don t want hit resulting in damage,Sports-and-Fitness
how to prepare for a golf tournament,preparing for a golf tournament requires having the right gear practicing sufficiently and knowing the course ahead of time,visit the course where the tournament is being held walk it view it and perhaps even play it ahead of time getting to know it is invaluable look at youtube flyovers of the course google earth shots might also be helpful get an idea how tough the course might be print out a scorecard from online if possible play a game there ask friends who have played the course or ask people who work at the course about major hazards tricks yard markers and green speed go to a driving range for practice if you are a member at any particular course that has a driving range and a putting green then that is perfect if not then go to a local driving range warm up when you reach the range make sure you grab 2 clubs and start loosening up your muscles take about 5 6 swings you also need to stretch your major golfing muscles generally at a junior tournament if the host club has a range the club will give you around 30 50 balls depending on size for your warm up routine get your lowest degree of club and get a feel for hitting the golf ball you do not need to be playing target golf for your first two shots after you get a feel for the ball then start playing target golf since you don t have many golf balls use the irons that you play your best with this will boost your confidence when on the range when you are about to hit your driver pretend you are on the tee block pulling out your driver then doing the pre shot routine when you have two golf balls left figure out what you are going to hit on the first tee and go through your routine pace yourself while on your local club s range make every shot count don t over prepare the day before the tournament make sure you are well rested instead go out on the range for an hour every day the week before a tournament not cramming in 5 hours of practice the day before build your mental toughness a big thing in golf is mental toughness it is not all about having the nicest and best equipment and do not believe all the scores people say they shoot until the end of the round most are there to intimidate you enjoy the game and play good golf enjoying yourself is the most important,Sports-and-Fitness
how to two putt consistently with the pace putting technique,learn how to consistently 2 putt as an amateur on any course by focusing on pace instead of line you will learn this technique in just a few practice sessions and it will change your golf score forever,the key to this technique is in being able to visualize a larger circle or hole around the cup and try to put your ball inside that hole could be to the right or to the left or front or back of the hole it doesn t matter as long as it is inside the circumference of your imaginary hole when you line up for your putt this is what it usually looks like unfortunately it is not that easy the circle in my minds eye is 4 feet 1 2 m in diameter and we all know how hard it is to sink any 4 foot 1 2 m put no matter the situation however most of the time given the large amount of space you are visualizing gives you a nice margin for error just like the huge driver heads of our modern golf equipment era and most of the time you can get the ball within 1 or 2 feet 0 3 or 0 6 m don t get me wrong this is a simple concept to understand but by no means and easy one to put into practice now let me visually demonstrate what i am talking about here is a typical hole now this is a daunting task for any of us 20 feet 6 1 m away or more especially with such a small target however if the target is much bigger it would be more achievable let s get started with the most difficult part of the process visualization now this may not be hard for everyone or maybe even most as i stated in the beginning of this book most golfers are already visualizing their shots however all most of us do is visualize our line in other words visualize the road or path the ball is going to take i am asking you to simply pick a point only a few feet in front of you and forget about the line instead focus on the destination the hole of course only this time visualize the hole being around 4 feet 1 2 m in diameter once you have a firm visualization in your mind don t aim just stroke the ball to the target i am telling you that if you can get a firm visual in your mind you will put the ball closer to the hole most of the time the toughest part about this is getting that firm visualization in your minds eye i use a visual of a 4 foot 1 2 m diameter ditch as if it has just been dug out around the cup i do this for two reasons i visualize simply having to get the ball into that 4 foot 1 2 m diameter 2 foot 0 6 m deep ditch so that it does not roll out the other end this allows me to give it the pace needed to get it there but not so much that it rolls out the other side if you just visualize a black hole then it will pretty much fall in at almost any pace and that defeats the purpose the other reason i use a ditch is because the color contrast helps be clarify the vision of course this is the part of the program which is completely unique to you every bit as much as your swing try different visualizations to see which is the easiest and clearest visual for you to focus on i realize that i stated earlier that this is all about 2 putting consistently and so the first put is all about getting it close enough to tap it in however for the concept to be effective you need to use at least a 4 foot 1 2 m diameter visual from 15 feet 4 6 m out or more but the diameter is again up to you and creating a visual that works so sometimes you will leave it 4 or 5 feet 1 2 or 1 5 m short in that case all you do is simply visualize a 1 foot 0 3 m or smaller diameter the closer you get to the hole i can almost guarantee that you might 3 putt once in a while but you will almost never put more than that most of the time you will 2 putt and i think we can all live with that now i am sure there are a bunch of you out there thinking this guy is nuts the most important part of the putting process is the line you take i agree it is important but not the most important part for golfers like me who just want to 2 putt on a consistent basis like i stated before we are not trying to get the ball in the hole we are trying to get it close to the hole which takes the line part of the process out of the picture and an extreme amount of pressure off of our minds who cares if the ball is 2 feet 0 6 m short left right or long it is still 2 feet 0 6 m away from the cup using the bowling approached my dad taught me will take care of the line enough so that you are not completely off the mark we both know that sometimes it will happen,Sports-and-Fitness
how to hit the golf club s sweet spot by using impact tape,think of the middle of your club head as a bull s eye you just need to adjust where you line up the club before you swing to ensure you re hitting the all important sweet spot,apply impact tape to the head of your club start with a pitching wedge or 9 iron take a practice swing to see where the ball hits the impact tape you will notice the dimples from the golf ball on the impact tape if the ball mark is on the end of the club head you may need to move the club head slightly away from your body this means that you need to line the ball up between the middle of the club head and the heel of the club head keep inching the club head forward or back depending where your mark is on the impact tape if the ball mark is closer to the toe of the club you need to line up somewhere between the middle of the club head and the toe start with a new piece of impact tape after you re hit a few balls this lets you get a clean picture of where you are impacting the tape get a dry erase marker preferably a dark color the mark will clean off easily with dry rag do not use a standard felt tip marker this will not work cover the face of a club using the dry erase marker set up your swing in the usual manner and hit the ball a dimpled ball mark will be left on the club face hit another ball and check your consistency recover the club face with the marker and proceed as before repeat the procedure with each club to ensure proper ball club relationship at swing set up check where the color is transferring from there should a dimpled mark where the club contacts the ball clean the club use a dry cloth and simply wipe off the marker with ease,Sports-and-Fitness
how to improve your short game,when it comes to lowering your scores in golf you need to consider all aspects of your game whilst improving your driving will give you an initial edge over your competitors your efforts will be in vain if you do not work on other key areas like your short game for example,recognise why your short game is suffering when playing near or around the green a decent short game will allow you to get near the pin for a simple one or two putt so if you re struggling to reach the green or have poor control getting onto the dance floor for simple putts then be sure to work on your short game when working on your short game you ll need a number of different shots in your locker for example the type of shot that you make will depend on where your ball is positioned as well as the location of the pin so if you re near a raised green you ll need to play a very different shot than if the green was beneath you in short you need a few strings to your bow if you want to master the short game of golf whether you re a beginner or a regular out on the course taking heed of the following tips will help you with your ball control and improve your overall scores too for pitching try using a pitching wedge or a lower lofted sand wedge you will play a pitch shot when positioned from three to thirty yards off the green a pitch shot typically rolls roughly the same distance on the green as it does travelling through the air in light of this you need to make some adjustments to your stance posture and grip first of all ensure that your grip is much weaker for pitch shots this will prevent your hands from rolling over the grip which will affect the control of the ball rotate your hands anti clockwise so that you can see one knuckle on your left hand for right handed golfers next open up your stance and set your feet closer to the ball set the ball further back in your stance the further back the steeper the trajectory of the ball upon impact work on your chipping a completely different shot to pitching the chip shot is perfect for when closer to the green the ball is chipped up in the air for only a short period of time it then travels a greater distance as it runs along the green towards the pin it s a relatively easy shot one that utilises very few moving body parts ensure that the ball is positioned at least two inches behind your centre keep your wrists hands and lower body quiet think of the chip as an extension of the putt rather than a shorter version of a golf swing use your shoulders to swing the club keeping your arms straight practice your lob shot a lot whilst this is one of the most difficult short game shots you can make it s certainly the most useful when you just miss the green it will enable you to get up and down easily without the ball rolling too much when on the green on the approach open up your body completely with your feet waist and shoulders all in the direction of the target line ensure you make a full swing cocking your wrists as you do to create an l shape between your arms and the wedge as you swing and follow through you want the club face to stay open and then finish as normal with the club pointing towards the sky also work on your bunker shot along with the lob shot the bunker shot is equally difficult to master however it s vital to get right because if you can t get out of the bunker in a single at most two attempt then you ll be looking at chalking up quite a big score use your sand wedge and stand firm with the bunker for added control open up your body and always strike the ball with an open face the key to successful bunker shots is the follow through use a full swing and aim to hit just under the ball taking half an inch of sand be sure to completely follow through and hold your pose as you would with normal golf shots,Sports-and-Fitness

in modern times they developed several advantages to be used outside the golf course though usually two seated can carry from one to six people and come in the forms of electric or gas golf carts electric is the most popular and commonly used today as it benefits the environment better than the gas cart and is cleaner to run these electric golf carts run with batteries that are plugged into slots to charge,start your golf cart when you first entered your golf cart consider how many people are riding with you use your key to switch your cart engine on in your cart notice that you have a reverse switch set the switch button to the reverse mode and release the brake pedal free continue to step on the brake pedal to stop your cart from moving reverse while stepping on the brake pedal

feel the golf cart at its slow pace as you continuously understand it add more pressure to the pedal understand golf cart speed usually golf carts produce enough power to run up from 12 14 miles per hour and cannot go beyond 25 miles the power and speed of your golf cart mainly depends on how much you used it in most circumstances low running vehicles like golf carts are legal in 35 mph zones

items along the way or people crossing the street don t use your electronic devices while driving for they are distractions that keep you from the road ahead of you drive with caution and even slow down at times if you drive too fast you have less time to react and puts you at great risk of nearby accidents drive defensively always be aware and alert of what all drivers around are doing and believe that what s unexpected may occur this may make you somewhat frustrated and angry but try to be patient because you can get over it soon try to assume that other drivers may be acting crazy

and the car in front of you allow it to be 4 seconds if the weather gets bad make a safe driving plan before you get prepared for the life you want try to analyze the situation or the road right now

your cart on the assigned path at all times do not drive onto the grass over time golf carts speed up while running on soil which leads to conditions that are harder for grasses to grow and to lower quality fairways for golfers this idea keeps the cart on the assigned path for the best results being in effect confirms the statement as a requirement following this rule drive on the assigned path until you are parallel to where your golf ball rests stop the cart grab some clubs and move to your ball use the 90 degree rule in effect this allows the golf course to bring carts onto the grass at a 90 degree angle position from the cart path don t drive the cart up the middle of the fairway from the tee box to the golf ball keep at a direct angle facing your golf ball and make a 90 degree turn from the path to the ball this rule lessens the time a golf cart spends on the grass to allow enough space for golfers use cart path only on holes x and x this happens when a golf course posts signs that assign golf holes off limits to carts in this situation the course s regular rules apply but on the assigned holes to keep your golf cart on the assigned path the reason is moisture on the given holes which might be too wet for carts or under ground repair on the specified holes do not use carts beyond limit point this sign is seen in a fairway as you move to a green spot courses don t want golf carts near the putting green as the sign gets the golfers attention even you are allowed to drive the cart on the fairway observe signs that tell what s not allowed when facing these signs stop and return to your path before moving forward again the sign comes as an arrow pointing toward the cart path which states the warning don t take the cart beyond this path better go back to your cart path these signs mainly regard cart usage as you observe them learn more about the rules when checking in understand gasoline golf carts they work like little cars with small engines run on gasoline and power the cart s wheels a typical difference to differentiate between cars and gasoline golf carts is how the engine runs for cars the engine starts when you turn the key and they keep running until you switch the key to off mode on the other hand in gasoline golf carts the engine starts when you step on the gas pedal and stops when you remove your foot from the gas it saves gas and keeps the society quiet understand electric golf carts they need batteries to power up their electric motor and are charged by plugging the cart through wall outlets some of then are fit with solar panels

how to play environmentally friendly golf,the majority of the work done to preserve golf courses is done by golf course superintendents and groundskeepers however golfers can also participate in the act of preserving the golf environment while playing one of the biggest aids to the environmental golf movement is when golfers support efforts by thinking and acting environmentally before and after playing expecting a perfect course is an unreasonable expectation and encourages superintendents to use harmful chemicals to fix problems that more mindful playing actions could have alleviated in the first place,play only within the course limits going outside causes erosion despoliation and creates unnecessary marks on other vegetation nearby do not enter any natural or designated areas they are protected for a reason as an amenity to improve your experience as a way to make the golf course look more pleasurable to local residents and passers by and sometimes even as a condition of the club s license avoid the use of golf carts if possible these produce greenhouse gases localized pollution and damage the turf with their weight and think about how your weight benefits by walking instead whatever your age obey all cart rules if using a cart the rules are there for good reason to prevent damage to turf to equipment and to others replacements cause resources to be wasted in their manufacture repair all ball marks this is the least you can do as a sign of respectful consideration pick up tees after use leaving them lying about can create problems for turf maintenance machinery for other players for wildlife dispose of trash recyclables properly as you would do anywhere keep your litter in a bin not in your environment use environmentally friendly products tees markers look for green products when purchasing and support these over non recycled etc products the more people who purchase earth considerate products the better and more people purchasing helps to lower the prices for such products,Sports-and-Fitness
how to practice golf,golf is an incredibly popular sport that is played frequently across much of the world while playing golf can be relaxing and fun it is also considered one of the most difficult sports to be consistently good at in order to practice so you can play your best every time you hit the course it s important that you utilize general practice tips and techniques hit the driving range to work on your long shots and spend time at the putting green to work on your short game,go to the driving range to practice with your driver and irons if you want to practice the longer shots for your golf game the best place to practice is at the driving range most driving ranges are set up so that you ll have plenty of space to practice teeing off with your driver and practice hitting various distances with your irons 1 x research source your driver is the club that you use to hit the longest shots in your golf game in most cases you ll only use your driver for your initial shot when you tee off from the tee box 2 x research source your irons are generally used for mid range shots when you re less than 600 feet 180 m away from the putting green 3 x research source while you may use your wedge instead of an iron in some situations you can use your irons until you reach the putting green as a general rule of thumb the closer you are to the green the higher iron number you use for example if you are 450 feet 140 m away from the putting green you d likely use a 7 iron if you re 390 feet 120 m away you d likely use an 8 iron work on your putting and chip shots at the putting green if you need to work on your shorter shots go to the putting green to practice with your putter and wedges many golf course practice areas have a sand pit next to or near the putting green so you ll be able to practice using your wedge to get out of the sand and onto the green 4 x research source make sure that you look out for and warn other golfers nearby when practicing with your wedges in the putting area wedge shots are meant to go high for a shorter distance making them difficult for other golfers practicing in the area to see coming use the practice areas 1 or 2 times per week for an hour unfortunately golf is not like riding a bike once you learn you need to practice consistently to keep improving therefore aim to practice for about an hour once or twice a week splitting your time between the driving range and the putting green 5 x research source for example if you ve been struggling with your short game try committing at least 1 day to practice on the putting green for several weeks if you re able to practice more you can then hit the driving range 1 day and play a full round of golf on another day in many situations you ll pay for time to practice by the hour or by the number of buckets of golf balls you rent since most golfers rent 1 to 2 buckets per practice round practicing for about an hour is fairly standard in most cases you ll want to limit your practice time on one swing to about an hour to avoid over fatiguing your muscles and risking injury stretch and warm up to prepare your body for practice in golf muscle control and posture are crucial to your success as a result it s important that you take several minutes to stretch your shoulders back legs and arms before taking any clubs out of your bag this will help loosen up your body and warm up your muscles so you ll be able to practice with precision and avoid an injury 6 x research source to stretch out your shoulders and arms try clasping your hands behind your back and slowly bending over for an easy leg stretch that s gentle on your back bend over at the waist and let your upper body hang for several seconds focus most of your practice session on one aspect of your game in most cases you ll only have a limited amount of time to practice your golf game by focusing primarily on one aspect of your game each practice session you ll be able to make the most of your time and improve on that one skill 7 x research source for example if you feel like you need to practice teeing off focus using your driver for a whole practice session try different grips to figure out how to hold your clubs there s no definitively correct way to hold your golf clubs so you ll need to practice and try out different grips to find what works for you you could try using some of the most popular grips first such as the baseball grip the vardon grip or the interlocking grip 8 x research source as you try out different grips don t be afraid to adjust any elements of the grip until you find what s most comfortable and enables you to hit the ball with the most accuracy 9 x research source square your feet to your target to properly align your body as you re practicing your long game with your driver and irons at the driving range make sure that your feet are squared to your target and the target is parallel to the club s face while it can take some time to align yourself properly before each shot doing so will help your body get accustomed to using proper alignment this will make it easier to get set up over time and help you consistently hit the ball more accurately 10 x research source when your feet are squared your toes will face away from your target so that the sides of your feet are parallel to the target squaring your feet to your target will also help you avoid opening your shoulders and will keep your arms aligned as you swing increasing your accuracy hit a few balls slowly to control your back swing and follow through when working on your long game with either your driver or any of your irons try going through your swing at half speed several times before practicing at full speed this will help you get a feel for the arm positioning as you go through your back swing and will help you assess when to transfer your weight from your back foot to your front so that you can follow through on your swing 11 x research source in addition this will help you practice turning your hips so that you follow through with your swing which will help prevent you from hooking the ball a hook refers to a shot that results in a curve in the golf ball s flight while you may want to hook the ball when it s helpful it usually happens unintentionally when you don t turn your hips all the way through your swing keep your eyes down to keep you from peeking as you swing looking up as the ball is hit is arguably the biggest mistake that golfers make instead practice keeping your eyes down as you swing with your driver or irons on the driving range make sure that you only look up after you ve completely followed through with your swing 12 x research source if you re practicing teeing off with your driver practice keeping your eyes down as you swing until you get a glimpse of the tee after the ball is gone this will help you make sure that you don t look up too early which can cause your shoulders to move out of alignment work on hitting your driver right in the center when practicing with your driver it s crucial that you work on hitting the ball right in the center of the face of the club so that your ball will go farther and faster with a more accurate trajectory to practice this first try a few half swings where you take the club halfway back through your back swing and swing it forward until your hands reach your waist stopping just short of hitting the ball once you ve stopped look at where the ball is in relation to the face of the club if it s off center adjust your stance until your able to hit the ball right in the center 13 x research source it can be helpful to do this drill whenever you find yourself hitting a few bad drives in a row most likely you re alignment is off so stopping to check in and make sure you re hitting with the center of the club s face can help you get back on track aim at a target when practicing with your irons first pick a target on the driving range and assess how far it is so you can decide which iron to use then align yourself to the target by imagining a straight line from the target to the face of your club practice hitting the ball towards your target realigning and adjusting your grip placement force and swing as need 14 x research source many driving ranges have flags that serve as targets on the driving range in many cases these flags indicate how far they are from the tee box so you can choose your irons accordingly for example if your target is about 450 feet 140 m away practice using a 7 iron if the target is 390 feet 120 m away practice with an 8 iron experiment with grips to figure out how to hold your putter because there is no definitively correct way to hold a putter it can be helpful to experiment with different types of grips until you find the one that works for you 15 x research source the most popular grips used in golf are the reverse overlap grip the cross hand grip and the claw grip in a reverse overlap grip your index finger on your non dominant hand overlaps your pinky finger on your dominant hand in a crosshand grip your index finger on your dominant hand overlaps your pinky finger on your non dominant hand when using a claw grip your hands don t overlap and instead rest one below the other on the club there are also several variations of these popular grips that you can try out including an adjusted reverse overlap or crosshand an adjusted claw hand grip or a split reverse overlap grip when you re practicing on the putting green if you keep hitting putts past the hole try gripping farther down on the handle before deciding that a particular grip is not for you you may find that a grip works for you if you just grip farther down to shorten your stroke 16 x research source practice your putting posture to increase your accuracy when practicing your short game on the putting green it s crucial that you practice with good posture to avoid practicing bad habits first stand up straight with your shoulders back then bend toward the ball from your hips keeping your back flat to avoid hunching over make sure that your arms are aligned to keep you from pulling your putts 17 x research source pulling a putt occurs when you hunch over and have to turn your body to putt causing your arms to move out of alignment this generally makes the ball steer left of the hole rather than going straight in putt with your dominant hand only to improve your follow through practicing your short game on the putting green is all about patience concentration and improving your hand eye coordination to help you do this try doing a few drills where you putt with your dominant hand only this will help you get used to the motion of following through with your putts and keep you from turning to face the hole before you ve followed through 18 x research source when practicing with your dominant hand only you can put your non dominant hand on your hip or rest it across your lower back stick a tee in the ground to keep you from peeking take a tee and stick it all the way in the ground on the putting green until the top is flush with the ground then practice putting balls right off the top of the tee making sure that you catch a glimpse of the tee after you putt before you lift your head up to look at where the ball has gone 19 x research source this will keep your head down long enough to keep your arms aligned peeking is when you lift your head as you putt the ball this causes your non dominant shoulder to rise pulling your arms and hands off track and causing the putt go to the side or short of the hole use only 1 ball on the putting green to keep your focus instead of using several balls to practice follow through with your putts with 1 ball until that ball makes it in the hole golf is a competitive game that requires a lot of mental focus and drive it can be difficult however to practice with the same mental intensity as a game when you re on your own 20 x research source to help you mentally practice while physically improving your short game try using only 1 ball on the putting green this will essentially put you in competition with yourself and help you keep your mental focus since you won t have a bunch of balls to choose from 21 x research source work on distance control when using a wedge when practicing your short game with your wedge try setting the ball at various distances so you can work on your chip shot pitch shot ¾ swing shot and full swing wedge shot like with your irons wedge clubs are used to get the ball to travel a specific distance instead of using a different club like with irons however with a wedge you ll need to control your swing in order to hit the ball different distances therefore it s helpful to practice at a variety of distances to help you figure out how much force to use to get the ball onto the green 22 x research source wedge shots are designed to go up high over a short distance this is often used to get the ball onto the putting green when you ve hit it just a bit short 23 x research source a chip wedge shot refers to a shot that is generally less than 45 feet 14 m from the hole with a chip shot you generally won t go through your entire back swing and instead will do a short swing to get the ball up high and onto the green from just off the green or in a sand pit a pitch shot is similar to a chip shot but used when the ball is a bit farther out about 75 feet 23 m a ¾ swing shot is used to get the ball high and over about 225 feet 69 m with this wedge shot you swing the club about ¾ of the way back through your back swing and follow through this helps you get a bit more distance than a chip or pitch shot but not as far as you would with a full swing if you are about 300 feet 91 m from the hole and need to get the ball up and onto the green practice hitting the wedge with your full swing,Sports-and-Fitness
how to do a cartwheel,the cartwheel is a basic gymnastics skill that will strengthen your upper body and help you work your way up to more advanced moves to learn how to cartwheel you ll need to find a safe environment in which you can practice placing your hands and feet in a way that will propel you forward and upside down make sure to stretch before you start practicing to avoid injuries,picture an imaginary line extending straight in front of you use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel you can even use painter s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat this line should be at least several feet long try to stay on the line as if the line is a balance beam but do not focus on just the line focus on form too 1 x research source make sure the area around your line is free and clear avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into injuries occur when you bump into something hard lunge forward with your lead leg and raise your arms slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line hold your arms straight up by your ears 2 x research source a common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways make sure you re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel that is the correct way either leg can be your lead leg sometimes however it s more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands some starting with your right leg in front others with your left whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel you can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable 3 x research source lower your arms towards the ground while raising your back leg keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well only lower your arms about halfway to the ground bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a t shape 4 x research source this step requires balance you may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold don t worry if you re having trouble balancing once you get the hang of the cartwheel you won t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement place your hands on the mat as you turn your body sideways put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first then put your other arm down so they re spread about shoulder width apart similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand place both hands along the imaginary line think hand hand feet to help you process the cartwheel 5 x research source for example if you lunged with your right leg place your right hand down first then your left hand keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head 6 x research source push off on your front leg then bring your legs up in a v shape straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air pointing straight upwards balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder width apart on either side of your head keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms 7 x research source use your shoulders and core for support you won t hold this position for long cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time if you are a beginner then you may want to practice more lower your lead leg as you lift the first hand you put down off the mat to complete the cartwheel put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line the first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel 8 x research source your weight should start to shift onto your legs keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat bring your other leg down while lifting your other hand off the mat your other leg will follow the first as it comes down make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from your second hand will lift naturally off the mat following the first hand 9 x research source at this point both your head and torso should be right side up centered over your legs a common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel land in a lunge facing in the opposite direction position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent while your original leading leg is behind you and straight just like a lunge keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards next to your ears 10 x research source position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing keep practicing until the movements feel comfortable continue to practice your cartwheel alternating back and forth between leading legs until you get the hang of it it may take some time so don t give up the form will not matter at first as long as you are supporting yourself in the air with your handstand getting the hang of it it s a cartwheel just remember to get the form once you can do it in a fluid motion one direction may be easier than the other for you most people have a dominant leg but practice both to get comfortable cartwheeling on either side pick one side you would like to do first if you start to get dizzy or lightheaded at any point take a break and wait for the feeling to pass before resuming cartwheeling put on comfortable flexible clothing to practice cartwheeling wear clothing that allows a full range of movement for your arms and legs compression clothing yoga clothing and gymnastic leotards are all great choices sports clothes are great too avoid non stretchy fabrics like denim avoid skirts and dresses as well which will flip over during the cartwheel 11 x research source workout or gym clothes including leggings and fitted tanks are a great option if you re practicing on a mat do not wear socks which can be slippery and cause you to fall find an open environment with a soft floor covering find a space that is free of furniture or other objects it s best to practice on a soft surface such as carpet a lawn or a gymnastics mat if you are not a beginner you can practice on a gym floor or something harder 12 x research source if you re practicing outside make sure the area you ve chosen is flat and level it will be hard to cartwheel over bumpy ground also make sure to check for rocks or gravel that might be hiding in the grass these will hurt your hands during a cartwheel stretch out your wrists and hamstrings stretching your body before you begin will keep you from injuring yourself while practicing cartwheels bend your wrists back and forth gently to loosen the muscles stretch out your hamstrings by sitting with your legs spread apart in a wide v bend your torso forwards towards the ground while reaching with your hands towards your left foot switch to the right foot after 15 or 20 seconds 13 x research source spend at least 3 minutes stretching before you start practicing your cartwheel if you re feeling particularly stiff extend your stretching session up to 10 15 minutes so you can fully limber up 14 x research source strengthen your biceps and triceps with weight training during a cartwheel you must support your entire body weight using your arm muscles if they re not strong enough you may have trouble completing the move the most important muscles to strengthen are the triceps and biceps both located in your upper arms 15 x research source do bicep curls using free weights to build up your bicep muscles start with smaller weights and move up as you get stronger learn to do a dumbbell kickback which will help build and strengthen your tricep muscles make sure to do the exercise with both arms practice a handstand to get comfortable with being upside down if you ve never done a handstand before it s best to try out this move before continuing on to the cartwheel or try handstands on the wall this will help you become familiar with the feeling of supporting your body upside down with your hands and arms 16 x research source get comfortable with safely exiting a handstand by pivoting on one arm and landing with your feet to the side this movement will help you safely exit a cartwheel even if you ve lost your balance you don t need to know how to do a handstand for a cartwheel but knowing how to do one is better than not knowing,Sports-and-Fitness
how to do a backbend,the backbend is a fun and graceful move that stretches your back opens up your chest and looks great when you can pull it off the trick is to work your way up starting with simple stretches and then practicing your bridge before long you ll be backbending on the wall with a spotter and then finally all on your own,warm up your muscles by jogging jumping rope or doing jumping jacks get your blood flowing and your muscles warm to start stretching out lay out a mat or find some soft ground use a yoga or gymnastics mat or a mattress or clear an area on a soft carpet or rug make sure your area is clear of any tripping hazards such as small objects stretch your ankles flex your foot as far back as you can so the toes are pointing up in the air then point your foot down so the toes are parallel to the floor or if you re more flexible angled slightly towards it repeat 10 20 times then switch feet roll out your ankles by sitting and holding an ankle in one hand roll your foot in circles several times then switch feet 1 x research source do a wrist extensor stretch extend your arm with your palm facing upwards and elbow straight pull your hand down with your other hand hold for ten seconds then repeat with your other wrist 2 x research source your wrists will be bending and bearing a lot of your weight in a backbend so make sure you stretch them well do a wrist flexor stretch extend one wrist in front of you with your palm facing away and your fingertips up pull your fingers back with your other hand until you feel a nice stretch hold for ten seconds and repeat with the other hand 3 x research source do a cat cow pose this simple yoga pose will open up your chest and back and get you ready for more intense stretches start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly below your shoulders inhale and drop your belly towards the mat arching your spine exhale and draw your belly into your spine rounding your back repeat 10 15 times 4 x research source try some deeper yoga poses get into cobra position by lying with your belly on the floor placing your hands under your armpits and pushing up arching your spine and stretching your chest try a camel pose by kneeling placing your hands on your lower back and arching your spine back if you re more flexible give the bow pose a try lie on your back and bend your legs up place your feet close together on the floor and bend your legs so that your knees are sticking straight up off the ground 5 x research source place your hands by your head your fingertips should be pointing towards your shoulders and your palms pushed flat against the floor with your elbows pointing up in the air 6 x research source push through your shoulders and lift your body straighten your arms as much as you can focus on keeping your core legs and butt muscles tight 7 x research source it s okay if you can t lift far off the ground yet or if you need to keep your arms bent practice your bridges a couple times a day and you ll feel yourself grow stronger lift only your hips off the ground if you can t push all the way up from your position laying on the floor place your arms down at your sides squeeze your butt and core to lift your hips off the ground 8 x research source hold the pose for a few seconds then lower yourself down bend your arms and slowly lower your body until you re lying flat on the ground give yourself a short rest then repeat 2 3 more times take one to two steps away from a blank wall place your feet about shoulder width apart from each other 9 x research source place your palms against your buttocks and push your hips forward lift and elongate your spine and rib cage this will allow your spine to stretch out and arch more cleanly 10 x research source stretch your arms straight up above your head and tilt your head back reach back far enough with your neck and back so that you can look at the wall 11 x research source bend your back and place your palms against the wall keep your elbows straight your head tipped back and your neck long press your hands against the wall remember to keep breathing 12 x research source walk down as far as you can continue to keep your elbows straight and breathe evenly 13 x research source walk your arms back up the wall and straighten from your hips inhale as you come back to standing take your time and lift your head slowly 14 x research source fall forward gently and touch your toes to stretch out exhale and bend smoothly from your hips allowing your back to relax take a couple of deep breaths 15 x research source step farther from the wall and repeat placing more room between you and the wall will force you to bend back a little further each time without the wall to support you getting you closer to a full backbend challenge yourself to walk down a little further each time keeping your elbows straight and breathing evenly do a backbend with a spotter supporting your back ask a friend or parents to place one hand on your lower back and one hand on your stomach using the same technique as your wall backbend minus the wall slowly lower into a backbend with your spotter supporting you 16 x research source have your spotter lift you back up ask them to move both hands to your lower back and slowly raise you back to standing 17 x research source try a full backbend without a spotter once you feel comfortable doing a backbend with a spotter try it on your own lift your pelvis and ribs and keep your arms bent and strong behind your head keep your feet about shoulder width apart as you lower down look through your arms to spot the floor breathe evenly and listen to your body if you can t go down all the way today take a break and try again later take your time and remember the technique you perfected using the wall if you re nervous about trying your backbend the first time place some pillows under your back so you know you have something soft to land on if you fall rock back and forth to introduce the movement push from your hands and roll forward into your toes then back onto your heels while keeping your head and neck relaxed as you get more comfortable peel your hands just slightly off the floor as you rock which will introduce the lifting motion to your body 18 x research source tuck your chin against your chest focus your weight and power in your lower body and core

how to do a back handspring,the back handspring is a basic building block for many gymnastics or cheerleading routines if you want to do a back handspring you should already have built up your upper body strength especially in your arms and shoulders before doing a back handspring you should be comfortable doing a backbend handstand and back walkover then practice with a spotter and on a trampoline until you feel confident doing a back handspring on the floor by yourself,bend your hips forward and swing your arms down to begin stand up straight with your arms extended by your ears then sit back like you re going to lean back in a chair as you do this swing your arms down and back behind you your knees should be directly over your feet not positioned in front of your feet or you won t generate enough momentum to land on your hands push through your toes and lift your arms up swing your arms forward until they reach over your head follow your hands with your eyes at the same time push through your toes to gain momentum and launch your body backward keep your legs together and your core muscles tight 1 x research source continue to fall backwards without arching your back too much arching your back too much is called undercutting and will not only make your back handspring look less pretty but it could also injure your back as you fall let your legs continue to drive you upward and backward point your toes and extend through your ankles 2 x research source make sure you keep your head back between your arms as they approach the floor plant your hands on the floor reach for the floor as you fall backwards and make sure to keep your body arched keep your arms straight so you don t hit your head on the floor your fingers should be pointing up and away from your face with your palms flat on the ground let the momentum of your legs with your lower body still following carry you over 3 x research source when your hands are planted on the floor use the pads of your hands and fingers your arms and your shoulders for support don t put all of your weight and pressure on your hands swing your legs over your head snap your legs over your head and around to the floor with your feet together and your toes pointed don t lock your knees but keep your legs almost straight keep your shoulders in line with your hands 4 x research source plant your feet on the floor continue by swinging your legs and feet over and snapping them down firmly toward the floor keep your upper body straight as your toes approach the floor 5 x research source pop up to finish the back handspring land with your legs slightly bent and pop up to release your momentum bring your arms straight in front of you and then raise them up over your head 6 x research source don t be discouraged if you don t get it right immediately work with a spotter until you feel comfortable enough to do it on your own with enough hard work you ll have a neat and smoothly executed back handspring in no time warm up you shouldn t attempt a back handspring without warming up as it makes you more likely to get hurt jog a few laps around the gym or track to get your blood flowing you can also jump rope for a couple minutes or do jumping jacks lunges or push ups stretch your wrists and ankles roll your wrists and ankles clockwise and counterclockwise five times each practice pointing and flexing your feet ten times each to stretch your wrists get on your knees and place your hands on the ground palms down with the fingers pointed at you then pull back on your arms to feel a deep stretch in your wrists 7 x research source to stretch your ankles sit on a chair and put an exercise band or jump rope around one foot pull on the band with your hands and push against the force with your ankle repeat with the other foot 8 x research source practice your handstands begin by standing straight up with your arms over your head let your body fall forward and place your palms firmly on the ground kick one leg up and allow the other leg to follow naturally tighten your core and buttock muscles to keep yourself in the upright position 9 x research source do a backbend start by standing up straight with your legs shoulder width apart and your arms extended by your ears look up at the ceiling point your fingers and push your hips forward slowly bend backward keeping your arms locked plant your hands firmly on the ground and keep your feet in place lower yourself slowly to the ground after holding the backbend for 15 30 seconds 10 x research source do a back walkover once you re comfortable doing a backbend practice doing a walkover when you re fully in the backbend position lift one leg off the ground and point your toes swing that leg around toward your head and push your other leg off the ground and allow it to follow naturally 11 x research source use a soft mat to get comfortable going backwards you should use a soft surface to prevent injury of

position to begin stand up with your feet planted firmly on the ground shoulder width apart 11 x research source as you become better at backbends you can bring your feet in closer together when you perform this exercise reach your arms to the ceiling as you lean backward you will rely on your arms to eventually catch the ground and support your bridge so you need your arms fully extended as you lean back round your back and bend backward slowly and with control round your back as you lean backward moving your arms and head at the same pace as you lean make sure your gaze follows where you re going so that you can see better and don t get dizzy if you have trouble executing this or are nervous practice in front of a wall so that when you start leaning back you can catch the wall with your hands and slowly walk your way down to the ground 12 x research source place your hands on the ground whether you walked down a wall or executed a full backbend place your hands on the ground as soon as you can reach don t let your chest or back collapse stay in the rounded back position to hold bridge pose come out of bridge pose you can come down from bridge pose as usual by lowering yourself down slowly or for people with more flexibility you can also exit bridge pose by walking back up the wall with your hands or pulling yourself out of the pose the same way you got into it exit bridge pose with a backbend kickover as an alternative the other way to exit bridge is by kicking your body back into a forward facing position 13 x research source to do this bend your knees more and bring your feet in closer to your body push your head farther through your arms so that you re looking at your feet stand on your toes and transfer your weigh to your non dominant foot raise your dominant

how to do a backflip,doing a backflip also called a back tuck somi or salto is a great way to show off your flexibility and agility but it s also an advanced skill during a backflip your body makes a full 360 degree rotation in the air because a backflip is difficult to achieve it will likely take you a bit of practice to master it,stretch your muscles before you jump to prevent injuries after a quick 2 5 minute cardio warmup stretch your arms legs chest and back you can do any stretches as long as they target the right muscle groups here are some stretches for you try do a forward bend to

a soft surface such as a gymnastics mat or foam pit a backflip is an advanced move so it usually takes time to master it you need to be on a soft surface to minimize your risk of injury a gymnastics mat or foam pit is the best surface but sand or grass may also work as another option you may prefer starting on a trampoline which provides some give and helps you build momentum however don t try your flip on a trampoline if you have trouble controlling the height of your jumps if you re new to backflips don t attempt to do one on a hard surface especially concrete use a spotter for maximum safety since a backflip is an advanced move it can be dangerous to complete especially at first it s important that you have someone there who can watch your jump and potentially help you at the very least make sure someone is with you to call for help if you get hurt if you lose your balance and fall it s possible that you will not be able to get yourself help stand with your feet shoulder width apart and your arms stretched overhead keep your back straight and neck straight with your gaze directed forward check that you feel stable and balanced up through your core before you enter your takeoff if you aren t balanced then you likely won t be able to complete your backflip with good form which increases your risk of falling and injuring yourself focus your gaze on an object in the distance this will help you keep your head facing forward in a neutral position it doesn t matter what you look at or if you can see it in detail you just want to avoid looking at the ground which can make you feel distracted or nervous it s important that you don t look around as you try to do a backflip because you can easily lose your balance which may result in injury bend at your knees into a high squat sit back as you bend at your knees keeping your back straight your chest should be in line with your knees but pointed up and your arms should be raised above your head 1 x research source don t bend too deeply if you re bending like you would for a normal squat you re bending too much similarly don t bend too far forward as this will throw off your balance instead of doing a backflip you ll likely end up doing a back handspring or not completing your flip swing your arms behind you stopping when they re just behind your back extend your arms in a straight line but don t lock your elbows your palms will be facing slightly toward the sky and turned slightly inward toward your body 2 x research source don t raise your arms too high as this can cause your jump to go backwards too much rather than upwards bring your arms forward and over your head as you leap upwards make a backward arc with your arms to help propel yourself backwards as you jump high into the air as your arms swing up push through your thighs to leap backwards swinging your arms helps give you the momentum to complete the jump keep your arms straight the whole time don t allow them to go flailing about you should be jumping upwards not backwards your arm motion will help carry you backwards but you won t get enough momentum if you don t jump straight up pull your knees toward your chest at the peak of your jump your chest should be about parallel with the sky or ceiling when you pull in your knees this will begin your tuck grab your knees with your hands to secure your tuck bring your arms back in toward your legs as you tuck you can grab the back of your thighs or your knees as you tuck if you prefer if you feel yourself turning to the side as you tuck this is caused by a rear reflex you likely need to do more conditioning exercises such as jumps and stretches keep your eyes open during your flip so you can see to stick your landing as you flip try to spot the object in the distance that you were staring at before you began your jump this can help you time your landing once you see the object come into view you ll know you completed your rotation 3 x research source it s okay if you don t see the object you were staring at before you can still stick your landing as you complete your backflip stretch out your legs about 3 4 of the way through your rotation release your tuck and extend your legs outward then let them carry you down toward your landing as you return to the floor keep your knees bent as you come in for your landing a slight bend is all you need to properly stick your landing this helps you absorb some of the shock in your landing which protects your body don t bend too far down as you could lose your balance land with your hips under your chest and your knees aligned with your ankles your body will be nearly in a straight line as your feet hit the floor aside from the slight bend in your knees this is proper form which will help you avoid injury 4 x research source if your body is out of line it can put too much strain on your joints like your ankles or hips bring your chest up as you land to help you stay balanced you ll be in a near standing position when you land but your chest will likely be tilted forward complete the flip by pulling your back up straight as you stick your landing if you feel like you are falling forward when you land it s okay to reach forward to try to steady yourself with your hands however be careful not to fall forward onto your hands or arms as you could injure yourself your goal is to land in the same spot you started in but it s good if you land within 1 to 2 feet 0 30 to 0 61 m of your starting place,Sports-and-Fitness
how to do a cartwheel,the cartwheel is a basic gymnastics skill that will strengthen your upper body and help you work your way up to more advanced moves to learn how to cartwheel you ll need to find a safe environment in which you can practice placing your hands and feet in a way that will propel you forward and upside down make sure to stretch before you start practicing to avoid injuries,picture an imaginary line extending straight in front of you use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel you can even use painter s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat this line should be at least several feet long try to stay on the line as if the line is a balance beam but do not focus on just the line focus on form too 1 x research source make sure the area around your line is free and clear avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into injuries occur when you bump into something hard lunge forward with your lead leg and raise your arms slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line hold your arms straight up by your ears 2 x research source a common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways make sure you re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel that is the correct way either leg can be your lead leg sometimes however it s more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands some starting with your right leg in front others with your left whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel you can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable 3 x research source lower your arms towards the ground while raising your back leg keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well only lower your arms about halfway to the ground bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a t shape 4 x research source this step requires balance you may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold don t worry if you re having trouble balancing once you get the hang of the cartwheel you won t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement place your hands on the mat as you turn your body sideways put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first then put your other arm down so they re spread about shoulder width apart similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand place both hands along the imaginary line think hand hand feet to help you process the cartwheel 5 x research source for example if you lunged with your right leg place your right hand down first then your left hand keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head 6 x research source push off on your front leg then bring your legs up in a v shape straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air pointing straight upwards balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder width apart on either side of your head keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms 7 x research source use your shoulders and core for support you won t hold this position for long cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time if you are a beginner then you may want to practice more lower your lead leg as you lift the first hand you put down off the mat to complete the cartwheel put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line the first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel 8 x research source your weight should start to shift onto your legs keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat bring your other leg down while lifting your other hand off the mat your other leg will follow the first as it comes down make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from your second hand will lift naturally off the mat following the first hand 9 x research source at this point both your head and torso should be right side up centered over your legs a common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel land in a lunge facing in the opposite direction position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent while your original leading leg is behind you and straight just like a lunge keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards next to your ears 10 x research source position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing keep practicing until the movements feel comfortable continue to practice your cartwheel alternating back and forth between leading legs until you get the hang of it it may take some time so don t give up the form will not matter at first as long as you are supporting yourself in the air with your handstand getting the hang of it it s a cartwheel just remember to get the form once you can do it in a fluid motion one direction may be easier than the other for you most people have a dominant leg but practice both to get comfortable cartwheeling on either side pick one side you would like to do first if you start to get dizzy or lightheaded at any point take a break and wait for the feeling to pass before resuming cartwheeling put on comfortable flexible clothing to practice cartwheeling wear clothing that allows a full range of movement for your arms and legs compression clothing yoga clothing and gymnastic leotards are all great choices sports clothes are great too avoid non stretchy fabrics like denim avoid skirts and dresses as well which will flip over during the cartwheel 11 x research source workout or gym clothes including leggings and fitted tanks are a great option if you re practicing on a mat do not wear socks which can be slippery and cause you to fall find an open environment with a soft floor covering find a space that is free of furniture or other objects it s best to practice on a soft surface such as carpet a lawn or a gymnastics mat if you are not a beginner you can practice on a gym floor or something harder 12 x research source if you re practicing outside make sure the area you ve chosen is flat and level it will be hard to cartwheel over bumpy ground also make sure to check for rocks or gravel that might be hiding in the grass these will hurt your hands during a cartwheel stretch out your wrists and hamstrings stretching your body before you begin will keep you from injuring yourself while practicing cartwheels bend your wrists back and forth gently to loosen the muscles stretch out your hamstrings by sitting with your legs spread apart in a wide v bend your torso forwards towards the ground while reaching with your hands towards your left foot switch to the right foot after 15 or 20 seconds 13 x research source spend at least 3 minutes stretching before you start practicing your cartwheel if you re feeling particularly stiff extend your stretching session up to 10 15 minutes so you can fully limber up 14 x research source strengthen your biceps and triceps with weight training during a cartwheel you must support your entire body weight using your arm muscles if they re not strong enough you may have trouble completing the move the most important muscles to strengthen are the triceps and biceps both located in your upper arms 15 x research source do bicep curls using free weights to build up your bicep muscles start with smaller weights and move up as you get stronger learn to do a dumbbell kickback which will help build and strengthen your tricep muscles make sure to do the exercise with both arms practice a handstand to get comfortable with being upside down if you ve never done a handstand before it s best to try out this move before continuing on to the cartwheel or try handstands on the wall this will help you become familiar with the feeling of supporting your body upside down with your hands and arms 16 x research source get comfortable with safely exiting a handstand by pivoting on one arm and landing with your feet to the side this movement will help you safely exit a cartwheel even if you ve lost your balance you don t need to know how to do a handstand for a cartwheel but

your other leg swinging up behind you 6 x research source swing both your legs over your head keep whipping up your rear leg then launch off your leading leg so that both legs are above your head keep your hands in fists if you are tempted to reach out and grab the ground if you feel like you re going to fall on your head put your hands down it s better to be safe than to risk getting hurt try to twist your torso so that it is pointed in the direction of travel with your arms perpendicular from your torso keep looking forwards as you go through the aerial land onto your first leg and plant your launching leg to finish the aerial swing your leg between your outstretched arms and plant it on the ground if your leg is swinging down and your arms are in its path move your arms so you don t kick yourself on your landing 7 x research source touch down with your launching leg about a foot s distance from your landing leg straighten up and use your hands to regain your balance if you need to you ve just finished your aerial use a spotter when you are just beginning when you are just learning how to do an aerial cartwheel make sure to always practice with someone there to spot you have the spotter stand behind you and over to the side in the direction that you will be doing the cartwheel 8 x research source a spotter can assist you by putting their right hand on your left hip when you are performing the aerial and catch you when you are finished by putting their left hand on your right hip so you don t lose balance a spotter can also catch you if you can t complete the aerial and topple over practice the aerial from a stationary starting position when you are just starting learning how to do aerials it s easier to get the momentum you need by taking a few running steps as you get comfortable doing aerials cut out the running and get your momentum through your hop with your rear leg and an explosive take off practice doing regular cartwheels don t skip practicing regular cartwheels and move straight on to aerials knowing how to do a cartwheel effortlessly will strengthen your sense of balance and coordination which is essential in your training keep practicing until you feel like you can do a cartwheel in your sleep a regular cartwheel is the foundation for an aerial cartwheel and if you don t feel 100 comfortable doing it you won t be successful in learning an aerial cartwheel do a one handed cartwheel after you have mastered the regular cartwheel learn how to do a one handed cartwheel a one handed cartwheel brings you one step closer to your goal and will teach you how to momentum your energy through the cartwheel without using both of your hands 9 x research source when you practice one handed cartwheel switch off between your right and left hands this will prevent you from becoming dependent on one of your hands for the stunt do a one handed cartwheel and delay putting your hand down once you feel comfortable doing one handed cartwheels practice doing them and wait until the last possible moment to put down your hand as you flip this will stop you from using your hand as a crutch so that you get used to the feeling of moving upside down in the air without your hands supporting you do dynamic stretches regularly dynamic stretches are extremely important if you are starting to learn aerials and other tricks dynamic stretches differ from regular stretches because instead of stretching and holding a position dynamic stretches require you to stretch your muscles through a series of quick movements 10 x research source because dynamic stretches mimic the quick motions your body goes through as you do aerials or other tricks doing these stretches before training minimizes the chance of pulling a muscle or hurting yourself examples of dynamic stretches include leg lifts and kicks body twists and side bends,Sports-and-Fitness
how to teach yourself gymnastics,gymnastics is one of the world s oldest and most revered physical disciplines requiring extraordinary strength balance agility and coordination however gymnastics academies are uncommon in many areas and formal instruction is often expensive making it difficult for some to get involved in the sport fortunately it s possible to get a good grip of the basics on your own as long as you re smart and careful about training to learn fundamental gymnastics skills you only need a place to practice practical knowledge of correct technique and safety measures like crash mats or a spotter to help you with more difficult skills,make sure you re physically prepared before you start flipping pirouetting and standing on your head you should work to reach a base level of physical conditioning build your muscular strength by performing calisthenics exercises such as push ups pull ups air squats and crunches go for a jog or swim laps a couple of times a week to get in better cardiovascular shape begin stretching thoroughly every day flexibility plays a critical role in gymnastics 1 x research source as you progress keep up with your strength and conditioning exercises and increase their intensity if you have a history of serious injury or a condition that makes strenuous exercise difficult or risky gymnastics may not be for you but other sports are out there approach each skill as a beginner start learning all the most basic skills from the ground up you may have performed some gymnastics moves as a kid or think you have a pretty good idea of how it s supposed to be done but if you want to learn the right way you need to put pride aside and start from square one looking at each skill like it s your first time will help do away with any misconceptions you may have and orient you with the correct technique 2 x research source any expert will tell you that the most important aspect of getting good at anything is mastering the basics spending more time becoming confident with fundamental skills will benefit you in the long run some good techniques to add to your repertoire when you re first starting out are backbends bridges headstands handstands forward and backward somersaults cartwheels and splits 3 x expert source tanya berenson gymnastics instructor expert interview 22 may 2020 focus on technique do every skill the right way or don t do it at all proper form and precision are the two most important components of the sport if you learn something the wrong way not only do you run the risk of injury but you might also establish bad habits that affect every skill that builds off that movement 4 x research source film yourself and compare it to the photo and video tutorials you re using to review your technique practice religiously whenever you get a chance set aside time to drill the techniques you ve learned only work on skills that it s safe for you to do by yourself or under the supervision of an adult or someone else who can spot you this will mostly include simple floor movements flips and other complex skills will be too dangerous to learn on your own formal instruction can provide you with useful cues for learning more quickly but the progress you re able to make depends almost entirely on how hard you re willing to study and work 5 x research source try to set aside at least three hours a week to train remember practice doesn t make perfect perfect practice makes perfect you should always put special emphasis on the correct form when training and give it your all begin with the somersault one of the simplest skills to learn as a beginner is a somersault 6 x expert source tanya berenson gymnastics instructor expert interview 22 may 2020 to perform a front somersault crouch down and place both hands on the ground directly under your shoulders tuck your chin and lean forward until your head clears the floor then roll carefully down the length of your spine finish by bringing your feet back beneath you and returning to a standing position 7 x research source you ll need to push lightly with your legs to create enough momentum for the roll to propel you all the way over to your feet 8 x research source curl up as tightly as possible to make the roll one fluid motion move on to backwards rolls 9 x expert source tanya berenson gymnastics instructor expert interview 22 may 2020 squat down with your weight over your heels lower your weight until your butt touches the ground using your hands to guide you if you need to rock backward tucking your knees up toward your head tilt your neck to one side and roll over your shoulder pushing through with your hands to assist you come to a stop by touching down with one knee at a time then rise to your feet 10 x research source because of the amount of control you have over the early stages of the movement the backward roll can be learned at a more gradual pace than the front somersault making it easier to master test your flexibility with a bridge lie flat on your back with your knees bent feet on the ground bring your arms up and back until your palms are resting on the floor beside your head use a coordinated push to hoist your body up into an arched position bending backward as the name suggests make sure you re in a stable stance by keeping your hands and feet planted firmly reverse the motion in a slow controlled manner to return to your back 11 x research source the bridge requires a moderate amount of upper body strength for stabilization so you may have to work up to it over time 12 x research source lower yourself slowly to keep from bumping your head try a handstand from a normal stance stagger one foot in front of the other lean forward at the waist keeping your torso rigid and straight with your arms extended over your head place both hands down on the floor at the same time kick up with your back leg to elevate yourself into an inversion push through your shoulders keeping your arms locked use small adjustments of your fingers and palms to maintain your balance when you re ready to come down lower one leg back to the floor at a time 13 x research source practice handstands against a wall until you get the hang of kicking up and balancing 14 x research source you ll need to know how to recover safely if you should happen to lose your balance while in an inverted position simply bring one or both feet to the floor underneath you if you re falling backward and turn slightly to one side and step out if you re falling forwards 15 x research source learn to do a cartwheel 16 x expert source tanya berenson gymnastics instructor expert interview 22 may 2020 stand at the ready with your hands by your sides take one long step with your dominant leg raising your arms up over your head as you do shift your weight forward and teeter your upper body down towards the ground as you shoot your back leg up forcefully behind you this action is similar to kicking up into a handstand only this time you ll set one hand down after the other starting with the same side as your lead leg while following through with your kicking leg let the kick carry you up and over the top landing on the same leg then following with the other 17 x research source this skill takes its name from the movement of the spokes on a wheel imagining yourself turning over in the same fashion can help you learn the correct hand and foot positioning needed for the technique cartwheels are tricky because to pull them off successfully all four limbs must coordinate independently of one another start by practicing them at a low angle until you get the timing right then gradually kick up harder until you re more inverted the cartwheel is an important prerequisite for the one handed cartwheel round off and aerial skills 18 x research source wear comfortable clothing pick out clothes that allow you to move freely competitive athletes work out in team uniforms usually leotards or tights but at home you can wear shorts or sweatpants with a tank top or anything else that feels good to bend twist and leap in you also have the option of wearing shoes which will protect your feet though they might feel clunky when you re performing skills that require a high level of coordination above all you should be comfortable and uninhibited 19 x research source if you have long hair pull it back in a tight ponytail or bun to keep it from falling in your face it might be a good idea to bring along a pair of shoes when you re practicing outside or any place with rough uneven surfaces find suitable places to practice since you won t have access to an actual gym you ll have to exhibit a little creativity in coming up with places to work on your skills for floor techniques such as cartwheels backbends handstands and basic tumbling a simple grass field might do the trick in addition some public playgrounds have equipment that you could use to practice bar skills like swinging casts and landings always have someone around to help you when you re playing around with difficult or risky maneuvers 20 x research source a low wall could be used as a vault a tree stump could serve as a pommel horse rings can be bought and hung for cheap the only thing limiting you is your imagination trampolines and swimming pools can help you get over your fear of new skills that involve unfamiliar movements like flipping and twisting just use them sparingly as they can encourage bad habits if you rely on them too much protect yourself from injury be smart about the way you train to avoid getting hurt always warm up and stretch thoroughly before pushing your body with high impact movements when training outside scan the ground for rocks sharp sticks and other dangerous unseen obstacles if you can put down mats to cushion the impact when attempting new skills for the first time 21 x research source have a friend spot you if you re scared to try out a technique on your own start small and work your way up be patient and drill the basic techniques repeatedly until you re competent enough to move on to more difficult skills your progress will be very slow and gradual and that s okay don t get in too big of a hurry to improve you re more likely to make mistakes and hurt yourself if you force yourself to try techniques you re not yet ready for 22 x research source once you re ready for intermediate level skills add front and back walkovers handsprings aerials and standing flips to your practice sessions when you feel yourself getting impatient remember that a cartwheel leads to a round off a round off leads to a back handspring a back handspring leads to a back tuck a back tuck leads to a back full etc one thing builds off another be prepared for accidents when you re teaching yourself and practicing alone a lot can go wrong in all likelihood there will come a time when you suffer a sprained ankle a pulled muscle or even a broken bone just like any other gymnast invite a friend along when you practice to be there in case you slip up keep a phone on you and have an emergency contact in mind that you can call if something bad were to happen 23 x research source hospital bills can get very costly if you don t have a solid insurance plan you may want to consider picking up another hobby one of the most unfortunate injuries you can incur is a bruised ego setbacks will happen and they can often be painful and embarrassing but don t let them discourage you from reaching your goals study video tutorials online pull up instructional videos on youtube and similar websites by running a simple search you can often find helpful content that breaks down technique offers detailed explanations of unusual movements and features slow motion demonstrations look to make sure that a given video was produced by an official gymnastics school or coach otherwise the information it outlines might not be trustworthy 24 x expert source tanya berenson gymnastics instructor expert interview 22 may 2020 examine videos of skills you re in the process of learning to familiarize yourself with the way they re supposed to look take notes from the videos you watch so you ll have them to refer to while you practice read gymnastics publications pick up whatever books magazines and other published works related to gymnastics you can get your hands on the articles and photos they contain will prove very illustrative and can give you technique tips and ideas for new training exercises a good place to start would be an instructional guide that provides a comprehensive overview of the sport such as gymnastics for dummies go over written guides extensively to gain an understanding of how certain techniques work you ll have to be willing to do a little more homework since you won t have the benefit of a coach if you re lucky you might even be able to track down copies of old gymnastics training manuals used to teach competitive athletes in past decades 25 x research source attend web seminars in some cases you may be able to register for gymnastics instruction over the internet for a small fee online education might take the form of e books video seminars and or virtual classrooms led by experienced coaches these web seminars are typically designed to provide new instructors with practical lessons but you probably stand to learn a lot yourself if this option is available to you 26 x research source verify that an online course is being presented by a reputable coach or athlete before signing up seek out qualified advice ask for pointers from those who are involved in the sport if you know someone that does gymnastics see if they ll pass on a portion of what they ve learned to you sit in on a gymnastics class if there s a school nearby and absorb as much of the coaches instruction as you can you might even be able to find a friend or acquaintance willing to work with you one on one in their spare time 27 x research source look into whether your area university ymca or rec center has an existing gymnastics program or club clubs like these are often free or inexpensive and open to people in the surrounding community 28 x research source try asking questions online on gymnastics message boards these can be an excellent resource for getting info from many different knowledgeable parties if you re under 18 ask a parent if it s okay for you to post on internet forums before turning to them for help 29 x research source 30 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to learn to do a front walkover in 1 day,the front walkover is one of the most fundamental floor skills in gymnastics it is a prerequisite for more advanced techniques like the front handspring and front aerial though it may seem hard at first learning to do a front walkover is actually surprisingly simple all you have to do is get the hang of a couple basic skills including the handstand and bridge then slowly put them together at your own pace with a little patience and safety to help you get over your fear you ll be doing front walkovers by the end of the day,find a safe place to practice before you attempt a front walkover you ll need a spot where you can play around with new techniques and exercises without worrying about hurting yourself look for spots that are outside or have enough space for you to move around freely if you re practicing outside try to find an area with grass sand or loose dirt which can help cushion the impact if you fall 1 x research source make sure your outdoor practice space is clear of rocks twigs and other debris that could cause a painful mishap see if you can spend the afternoon learning the front walkover in your school gymnasium or the local community center parks and playgrounds with rubberized flooring make great places for safely trying out new skills 2 x research source grab a spotter pull a friend parent or sibling aside and ask them if they can spot you as you get the hang of difficult or scary skills a spotter can guide you and support your weight as you run through the movement which lets you focus on your technique almost anyone can be a spotter so there s no reason not to have one on your first few tries 3 x research source to properly spot a front walkover have your spotter place one hand across your lower back and give you a lift as you stand up out of the bridge 4 x research source your spotter should be someone who is tall and strong enough to help hold you up put down some mats mats and protective padded surfaces will serve to prevent injury in case you land incorrectly they will also take away a good deal of fear as you know you re unlikely to get hurt even if you mess up once you get more comfortable with the skill you can slowly start building up the courage to do it without pads testing the waters with a mat can really speed up the learning process so that by the end of the day you ll be doing walkovers with no hesitation you can buy fold up tumbling mats designed specifically for gymnastics and cheerleading at most sporting goods stores these will lay over any flat surface and store easily when you re finished with them if you don t have mats available to you use folded blankets pillows or couch cushions to break your fall go at your own pace even though your goal is to learn to do a front walkover in the course of a day there s no need to rush yourself the bigger a hurry you re in the more likely you are to make mistakes or develop bad habits spend a couple of hours or longer breaking down and drilling each phase of the technique and take your time overcoming intimidating challenges 5 x research source create short term goals for the day such as i d like to be able to hold a bridge by the end of the afternoon or i ll try my first walkover without a spotter after dinner don t forget to take rest breaks occasionally tumbling is a strenuous activity and you won t perform as well if you re tired stretch out thoroughly movements like the front walkover can put a lot of strain on your wrists shoulders and back so it s a good idea to stretch out these parts of your body prior to practicing following a light warm up loosen up your muscles and joints this will get your blood flowing and energize you as well as increase your range of motion allowing you to get into tricky positions easier 6 x research source raise both arms up high then reach across your body as you lean from side to side at the waist lie face down on the floor and push your torso up and back to limber up your lower back flex both wrists to get them ready to hold you up don t neglect your warm up and stretching routine you re at a much higher risk of injury if you force your body to perform difficult movements before it s ready 7 x research source start with a handstand since a well controlled handstand is the setup for the front walkover it will be useful to make sure you have it down first place both hands on the floor in front of you kick up with one leg then bring both legs together in a vertical position with your body straight and aligned maintain your balance by making minor adjustments with your hands and shoulders 8 x research source practice your handstands against a wall until you get used to being upside down and supporting yourself on your arms 9 x research source instead of returning your feet to the floor beneath you when you exit the handstand lower yourself forward into a bridge this technique is called a front limber and it will help get you more comfortable with transitioning to your feet aim to spend an hour or two drilling your handstand then start working on transitioning into the bridge and follow through get the hang of a bridge the bridge and backbend translate perfectly to the second part of the walkover lying on your back with your hands and feet planted firmly on the ground beneath you press up so that your body forms an arch support yourself by keeping your arms and legs straight and strong the back flexibility needed for to hold a solid bridge is key for learning the front walkover 10 x research source squeeze your butt muscles to help you stay tight in a bridge you won t need to be able to hold a bridge for very long in order to do a walkover so focus on standing up from the bridge to help you practice coming out of the technique easily 11 x research source turn a few cartwheels master your cartwheel to get used to the action of kicking up to your hands which will carry you over when doing the walkover set your hands down on the floor one after the other as you swing your back leg up drive through with your kicking leg to lift yourself into an inverted position then rotate around and set it back down followed by your opposite leg the technique of landing on the same foot you kick with is used in both the cartwheel and front walkover when doing a front walkover you ll only be tweaking your cartwheel technique slightly so that you re moving straight forward rather than sideways adjusting your cartwheel technique to practice kicking up into a handstand can help you get the hang of getting inverted by the end of the day reach down and place both hands on the floor take a staggered stance with whichever leg you prefer to kick up with in the back bend over at the waist and set your hands down a couple feet ahead of your front foot your hands should be a comfortable distance apart and parallel with your fingers spread out in front of you 12 x research source start with your weight in the heels of your palms and shift it to your fingers as you raise up into the handstand your hands should stay in the same position throughout the walkover kick your back leg up behind you throw your kicking leg up hard keeping it as straight as possible throughout the movement the kick will begin to lift you into a handstand keep your other foot on the floor for as long as you can the momentum generated by the kick will power you through the walkover in one smooth motion while your extended front leg will act as a counterbalance to help you stand back up 13 x research source you ll need to kick forcefully in order to rotate around with enough speed to walk out of the backbend front walkovers are all about confidence if you don t commit to the movement you won t have enough force to carry you over raise up into a handstand after you kick up begin lifting your other leg off the ground both legs should now be in the air leaving you in an inverted position balance carefully as you continue to whip your legs over and behind your body brace your upper body but keep your hips and legs loose 14 x research source press your fingers into the floor to stabilize yourself and control your speed as you bring your legs over the top unlike a normal handstand resist the urge to bring your legs together they should stay split from the time you kick to the time your first foot hits the floor lean forward to catch yourself in a bridge at the top of your handstand arch your back to bring your kicking leg closer to the ground as it comes around lean your weight forward as you prepare to come into contact with the floor the basic idea is that you re gracefully falling into a bridge one leg at a time 15 x research source while your body is tilting forward keep your eyes on the floor just in front of your hands to maintain your center of gravity if you try to look too far up or down you may fall out of position use a raised surface like a bed or the seat of a couch to get a feel for landing with your first leg 16 x research source this is the most difficult part of the skill and will likely take a few hours to practice before you get it down touch down with one leg after the other your kicking leg should now have traveled over your body and be pointed at where you will land keep leaning and arching your back until you feel your toes hit the floor shift your weight onto your first foot as you swing your other leg through push off of the ground with your arms and shoulders to return you to an upright position you can then glide naturally out of the movement and finish strong and tall you ve just done your first front walkover in less than 24 hours 17 x research source keep your legs split until the moment your first foot touches the floor if they re too close together the transition won t be as smooth and it will be much harder to stand back up practice front walkovers regularly until you start to see improvement in your technique,Sports-and-Fitness

how to do a back handspring,the back handspring is a basic building block for many gymnastics or cheerleading routines if you want to do a back handspring you should already have built up your upper body strength especially in your arms and shoulders before doing a back handspring you should be comfortable doing a backbend handstand and back walkover then practice with a spotter and on a trampoline until you feel confident doing a back handspring on the floor by yourself,bend your hips forward and swing your arms down to begin stand up straight with your arms extended by your ears then sit back like you re going to lean back in a chair as you do this swing your arms down and back behind you your knees should be directly over your feet not positioned in front of your feet or you won t generate enough momentum to land on your hands push through your toes and lift your arms up swing your arms forward until they reach over your head follow your hands with your eyes at the same time push through your toes to gain momentum and launch your body backward keep your legs together and your core muscles tight 1 x research source continue to fall backwards without arching your back too much arching your back too much is called undercutting and will not only make your back handspring look less pretty but it could also injure your back as you fall let your legs continue to drive you upward and backward point your toes and extend through your ankles 2 x research source make sure you keep your head back between your arms as they approach the floor plant your hands on the floor reach for the floor as you fall backwards and make sure to keep your body arched keep your arms straight so you don t hit your head on the floor your fingers should be pointing up and away from your face with your palms flat on the ground let the momentum of your legs with your lower body still following carry you over 3 x research source when your hands are planted on the floor use the pads of your hands and fingers your arms and your shoulders for support don t put all of your weight and pressure on your hands swing your legs over your head snap your legs over your head and around to the floor with your feet together and your toes pointed don t lock your knees but keep your legs almost straight keep your shoulders in line with your hands 4 x research source plant your feet on the floor continue by swinging your legs and feet over and snapping them down firmly toward the floor keep your upper body straight as your toes approach the floor 5 x research source pop up to finish the back handspring land with your legs slightly bent and pop up to release your momentum bring your arms straight in front of you and then raise them up over your head 6 x research source don t be discouraged if you don t get it right immediately work with a spotter until you feel comfortable enough to do it on your own with enough hard work you ll have a neat and smoothly executed back handspring in no time warm up you shouldn t attempt a back handspring without warming up as it makes you more likely to get hurt jog a few laps around the gym or track to get your blood flowing you can also jump rope for a couple minutes or do jumping jacks lunges or push ups stretch your wrists and ankles roll your wrists and ankles clockwise and counterclockwise five times each practice pointing and flexing your feet ten times each to stretch your wrists get on your knees and place your hands on the ground palms down with the fingers pointed at you then pull back on your arms to feel a deep stretch in your wrists 7 x research source to stretch your ankles sit on a chair and put an exercise band or jump rope around one foot pull on the band with your hands and push against the force with your ankle repeat with the other foot 8 x research source practice your handstands begin by standing straight up with your arms over your head let your body fall forward and place your palms firmly on the ground kick one leg up and allow the other leg to follow naturally tighten your core and buttock muscles to keep yourself in the upright position 9 x research source do a backbend start by standing up straight with your legs shoulder width apart and your arms extended by your ears look up at the ceiling point your fingers and push your hips forward slowly bend backward keeping your arms locked plant your hands firmly on the ground and keep your feet in place lower yourself slowly to the ground after holding the backbend for 15 30 seconds 10 x research source do a back walkover once you re comfortable doing a backbend practice doing a walkover when you re fully in the backbend position lift one leg off the ground and point your toes swing that leg around toward your head and push your other leg off the ground and allow it to follow naturally 11 x research source use a soft mat to get comfortable going backwards you should use a soft surface to prevent injury of any kind find a cushy soft mat and practice jumping backwards onto it swing your arms back the same way you would when doing a back handspring to get comfortable with the movements 12 x research source get a spotter make sure that when you try to do a back handspring for the first time you have a spotter like a coach or gymnastics teacher to help you this will prevent you from hurting yourself and will give you the confidence you need to successfully do the back handspring the spotter should place one hand on your lower back and one hand under your thighs to help you flip backwards 13 x research source make sure your spotter can sustain your weight and that they know how to properly spot try your back handspring on a trampoline if you re not feeling confident about backwards movements or you re a beginner to this move start off on a trampoline this way you can gain your confidence until you re ready to go and do it on a harder surface like grass without the risk of injury

how to do a back handspring at home,the back handspring is a gymnastics or cheer leading skill that allows you to connect skills or transition into more complicated skills however it does take a bit of practice to master the back handspring and you should have a solid back bend handstand and back walkover first so that you don t injure yourself if you re trying it at home you should make sure to have a spotter and use a softer surface such as a large mattress or even a mat if you can,get a spotter if you ve never tried a back handspring before then your best bet is to practice at the gym with your gymnastics coach or another professional however if you feel confident enough to do the back handspring at home then you should make sure to get a spotter to help you when you re starting out you will find that most people recommend you use a trampoline having a spotter will keep you from injuring yourself overstepping your bounds and hurting your head neck or back ideally your spotter should also be a fellow gymnast or cheerleader so he or she is familiar with what to do your spotter should place a hand on your lower back while placing the other under your thighs as you flip backwards stand by your spotter with your legs feet and knees nearly together and your arms in front of you first do a trust fall back into your spotter s arms just to make sure that he or she can handle your weight ideally there should be a soft mat behind you so you don t hurt yourself if you fall at first your spotter will do some of the work for you helping to flip your body over by pushing your back and your thighs up as you flip backwards however once you re comfortable on your own the spotter should only be there to make you feel safe not to actually help you stretch well 1 x research source you may be eager to get started on your back handspring but any experienced gymnast or cheerleader will tell you that stretching is vital to your success and safety even if you re only doing a somersault it s important to warm up a bit and to get your blood flowing before you go into a full on back handspring though stretching all of your body is important you can focus on stretching your legs your arms and your neck as well as your wrists here are some stretches you can try before doing a back handspring stretch your back by doing a back bend then do a counter stretch by curling up into a ball on the floor and hugging your knees to roll out your back for an extra stretch in your back stand up and touch your toes roll your head clockwise five times and then counter clockwise five times to stretch your neck a bit you can also roll your shoulders forward and backward place one hand in front of you as if you were saying stop and then gently pull back the fingers of that hand with your other hand repeat with the other hand to get a deep stretch in your wrists then roll your wrists clockwise five times and counter clockwise five times to finish stretching them sit down and roll your ankles clockwise and counterclockwise you can even spell the alphabet with each of your feet to get a full stretch use a padded surface the best thing you can do is to bring home a thick gym mat which will give you some cushioning without letting you sink in too far as a mattress would if you don t have that consider using a long couch cushion or a mattress while being careful not to sink into them too much if you don t have enough momentum you may end up falling back into the handstand position and then sinking in to the floor instead of springing up 2 x research source you can also consider using a trampoline if you have one to give yourself the confidence to use a harder surface just remember that you won t need nearly as much momentum to fall backward on a trampoline 3 x research source if you re trying the back handspring outside in your yard pick a softer surface like a grassy surface that s a little pliable instead of concrete or another harder surface that won t give stand with your arms out in front of you keep your feet about hip distance apart and look straight ahead of you in front of the tips of your fingers your hands should be about parallel to the ground when they re in front of you keep your back straight with a slight bend in your knees preparing to lower yourself down you can also start in the true starting position with your arms raised over your head by your ears before you move them down to be parallel to the ground before you swing them up again get in a sitting position while starting to swing your arms over your head now you can bend those knees further as if you were lowering yourself into a chair place those knees directly over your feet to help yourself generate some momentum as you do this you should swing your arms over your head to help generate momentum as you swing backward 4 x research source it can be helpful to practice the first two poses so you get the logistics down before you to try jump right in to the back handspring it s important to start with a strong foundation so you re generating enough momentum and maintaining proper form throughout the back handspring continue swinging your arms over your head as you push through your toes now let your arms swing until they reach over your head while pushing through your toes to give yourself that extra upward momentum you should lean your arms back as far as they will go there s no need to worry about landing your arms right near the place where your feet stood because you ll have to fall back a bit 5 x research source as you swing your arms up you should make sure to keep them by your ears make sure to tighten your shoulder and arm muscles and raise your head back between your arms continue to fall backwards as you do this make sure you don t arch your back too much there should be at least 2 feet 0 6 m between the place where you start and the place where you land your hands if you land those hands too close to your feet then you will risk injuring yourself arching your back too much is known as undercutting and it could cause you to sprain your back when you land your legs should continue to drive you backward and upward at the same time extend through your ankles while pointing your toes continue to keep your head between your arms as you get closer to the floor plant your hands on the floor as you finish falling backwards with an arched back you should keep your arms straight and even with your head so your arms touch the floor instead of your head the momentum in your legs along with that of your lower body should carry you over keep your fingers pointing away and up from your face with your palms staying flat on the ground on either side of your head 6 x research source when you plant your hands on the floor don t put all of your pressure into your wrists instead use the pads of your fingers and your palms for support otherwise you risk injuring your wrists at this point your legs may still be out in front of you but your body will soon be almost straight in a handstand position 7 x research source swing your legs over your hands now you ll find yourself in what is essentially the handstand position for a second you should swing your legs over your head so that they are straight up in the air in a handstand position as they continue to swing downwards though you won t actually hold the position because the back handspring is a continuous motion your body will be in this position briefly as you move toward finishing the back handspring keep your feet together or as close together as they can be and keep your shoulders strong to support your body weight you shouldn t lock your knees but work to keep your legs as straight as possible plant your feet on the floor your legs should swing over your arms and torso and all the way down to the floor make sure to snap them firmly down to the floor while your upper body remains straight as it begins to shift upward your feet should be about shoulder width apart with your toes pointing straight in front of you just in the same position that you started in you ll land with your knees slightly bent and will straighten out as you finish the move as your feet drift toward the floor your upper body should prepare to pop upward you ll literally spring up as your feet hit the floor your arms and upper body should move upward just as your feet hit the floor pop up as you land pop your body up and swing your arms straight in front of you and then up over your head in order to strike the finishing pose with your arms up over your head and your feet touching with your back straight though your first back handspring may not be exactly what you were hoping for with practice you ll be able to execute it as well as you can keep practicing it takes lots of practice to get the back handspring down once you re comfortable enough doing the back handspring without a spotter you can practice at home on your own with a comfortable surface you can work on getting the timing down so you can reach your arms over your head and fall backwards without enough momentum to spring forward to execute the move aim to do a dozen back handsprings a day and you ll be able to master the technique one common problem with the back handspring is falling backwards to one side make sure your feet and arms are parallel so you don t fall to the left or right and end up with an uneven back handspring remember to arch your back but not too much another common problem with the back handspring is that you ll arch your back so much that you ll end up finishing almost where you started creating a move that looks almost like a back flip and risking injury 8 x research source you may also have trouble generating enough momentum to do a back handspring on your own if that s the case you may want to practice doing a round off backhandspring so you have enough momentum to spring upward,Sports-and-Fitness
how to do gymnastic moves at home kids,gymnastics can be a very expensive sport potentially demanding high tuition fees for access to a professional gymnastics coach unlike team sports like soccer where it s perfectly safe to have an informal game in your backyard gymnastics is fairly dangerous to do at home 1 x research source 2 x research source however there are a few relatively safe ways you can practice your skills at home between lessons,tell an adult that you want to train at home ask a parent or guardian before starting any sort of gymnastics training in the house your guardian should be home and available to react immediately in case you are injured ideally an adult should be in the same room with you to act as a spotter wear appropriate clothing you will need to make sure your garments are not baggy enough that they impede your movements but also not so tight that they cause chafing make sure you are comfortable in the clothes if you are a girl the best thing you can wear for gymnastics is a leotard singlets are another specialty sports garment and can be worn by gymnasts of any gender like the leotard you may also choose to wear athletic shorts over top of your singlet you can also wear a t shirt or tank top with athletic shorts instead make sure that your clothes are free of buttons zippers or snaps do not wear socks exercising barefoot will prevent slips and falls if your hair is long tie it back securely only wear glasses if they are especially made for sports and won t slip if not leave them in a safe place where they won t get damaged 3 x research source set up a safe area to train in you will need a large area free from clutter preparing a room for gymnastics will help you to avoid serious injury only practice on a soft surface do not practice on bare hard wood tile or laminate flooring you can also ask an adult to buy a home athletic mat ask an adult to move all furniture against the wall make sure that the furniture is free of sharp corners if necessary cover sharp edges with a pillow or thick comforter consider at home exercise equipment pull up bars are relatively inexpensive and easy for an adult to install 4 x research source there are also athletic bars and balance beams you or an adult may buy for your home however these take up a lot of space and are best left for a dedicated exercise room warm up to get the most out of your training you will need to get warmed up properly warming up will boost your performance and prevent muscle soreness start by stretching your whole body tilt your head slowly from side to side and gently roll your head backwards stretch your arms by holding each across your chest for a few seconds and then raising it back over and behind your head do a few lunges to stretch your legs and lower back lift each leg slightly off the ground and roll each ankle flex each of your toes roll your wrists and flex your fingers after stretching get your heart rate up with a quick aerobic exercise this can be any kind of simple high intensity workout you can do on your own in a small space examples of these include jumping rope running in place or doing jumping jacks do this for a few minutes until you can feel your heart beating quickly but not for so long that you start to feel winded check your equipment make sure the floor mat or rug you ll be exercising on is flat and free of bumps if you re using a balance beam get comfortable on it first make sure that it doesn t wobble before standing up on it if you re using bars try shaking them to make sure they re stable before you put any weight on them crouch down put your hands spread out on the ground face away from a nearby wall make sure an adult is present when doing this move to keep you from falling walk up the wall backwards put your feet against the bottom of the wall and walk backwards keep your hands on the ground straighten your elbows and knees as you go up move closer to the wall using your hands once your legs are straight and your toes are up against the wall it s time for your hands to do the walking start by moving your right hand back slightly bring your left hand back to line up with the right repeat this until your stomach is very close to or flat against the wall you have just done an easy handstand 5 x research source return to position safely in gymnastics when a coach or guide tells you to return to position you should go back to the stance you started at in this case return to the crouch from step 1 to get back down walk forward with your hands and let your legs slowly slide down the wall stand up straight make sure your feet are together with your toes pointed forward raise your arms straight up into the air above your head the straight jump is a fairly basic jump that is safe to do at home it will help you to strengthen your legs improve your cardiovascular endurance and learn to keep your balance while you are unlikely to hurt yourself doing this jump you could still potentially twist your ankle or fall begin your jump by bending your knees while you squat simultaneously swing your arms back behind you make sure your arms are as far back as they can go while you reach the lowest part of your squat don t go so far down as to lose your balance but spread your arms to the side if you need to spring up into the air push off of your feet and extend your legs you will return to your original position with straight legs and upper body but now you will be airborne as you pop upward like a spring swing your arms back up over your head for added momentum 6 x research source stick the landing gymnasts coined this phrase to describe a method of landing on their feet that absorbs the shock and prevents injuries to do this land with your legs apart and knees slightly bent hold your arms out for balance in a perfectly stuck landing your feet should not move at all 7 x research source stand with your feet far apart at either side this is also called the straddle position they should be much further apart than your shoulders try to make your legs as wide as you can go while comfortably standing with your legs straight 8 x research source inch your legs further outward allow your feet to slide further apart until you are well practice take this step slowly keep your legs straight stop immediately if you feel any sort of pain forcing a stretch can cause injury hold your splits once you ve gone down as far as you can hold that position for as long as you can maintaining this stretch will help improve flexibility and strength use your hands for support if you feel wobbly 9 x research source practice your splits until you are able to reach the ground unless you are already athletic you will probably not be able to do the splits on your first try as you build up strength and flexibility you will be able to stretch your legs further apart and get closer to the ground this may take you a while so try your best to be patient 10 x research source squat down with your hands flat on the floor your knees should be close together and your hands spread apart your fingers should be pointed straight forward 11 x research source keep your head tucked at the chin to keep from hurting yourself 12 x research source only do this move on a mat or another very soft surface start your roll straighten your legs to push forward onto your back keep your head tucked in it should never touch the ground make sure to keep your spine bent and your legs tucked together use your arms for support and added momentum 13 x research source sit up while you re on your back bend your knees back together and hold your shins roll forward with the momentum generated by your legs you should end flat on your feet in an upright squatting position do this and step 2 all in one fluid motion to successfully complete a forward roll 14 x research source stand back up an experienced gymnast should be able to do this without pushing off from the floor with his or her hands however until you ve practiced enough it s perfectly fine if you need your hands if you feel unbalanced at all don t hesitate to use your arms for support stand on one foot keep your planted leg straight along with your upper body the purpose of scales is to learn how to stably balance your body in order to be a skilled gymnast you need complete control of your muscles at all times scales allows you to practice this skill in a safe environment raise one leg slowly in front of you hold your arms apart for balance keep your toes pointed forward and both legs and torso straight once your leg is in position hold it in place for a few seconds switch legs after each scale you will want to strengthen and learn how to balance both sides of your body equally bring your foot up higher and repeat your scales after doing them with both legs with training you will eventually be able to keep your balance with your leg facing forward at a right angle to your body do a back leg skill using the same methods swing one leg backwards keeping both your legs straight tilt your body forward to maintain a straight line between your body and airborne leg with practice you will be able to do a back leg scale so far that your body and leg become parallel with the ground 15 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to make your feet touch your head,touching your feet to your head may not be the most natural thing in the world but it is possible if you have enough flexibility if for whatever reason you find yourself compelled to try to touch your head with your feet the steps that follow will help you accomplish it,warm up warm your muscles up with some brief cardio like running jumping rope or doing jumping jacks 1 x research source it s important to warm up your muscles before stretching to avoid strain and potential injury stretch your hamstrings before trying to touch your feet to your head stretch your hamstrings to avoid straining them 2 x research source sit upright on the ground with your legs held straight in front of you slowly bend forward at the waist keeping your back straight extend your hands and reach for your toes if you can t reach your toes try touching your ankles or perhaps your knees move your extended legs out so that they re about shoulder width distance apart repeat bending forward and reaching for your toes or ankles or knees 3 x research source stretch your inner thighs begin by sitting on the ground with your legs extended in front of you 4 x research source bend your right knee and bring your right foot inward towards your pelvis slowly bend forward at the waist keeping your back straight extend your left hand towards your left foot try to touch

of touching your feet to your head 7 x research source lie flat on your stomach arms extended forward and legs extended behind you raise your legs do this step slowly and gently don t rush slowly bend your knees and raise your feet until your legs are bent upward behind you raise your chest again perform this movement slowly if you feel any pain stop immediately lift your chest and raise yourself up on your elbows you should be lying on your stomach resting on your elbows with your legs bent upward at the knee lift your chest and arch your back at this point only go as far as you comfortably can if you begin to feel pain or strain stop immediately and gently return to a neutral resting position lift your chest and draw yourself up onto your hands slowly arch your back and reach your head backward as far as you can touch your feet to your head don t force your body to go any further than it s capable of or comfortable with or you could injure yourself draw your feet forward and upward towards your head arch your back and extend your head behind you until you feel your feet touch your head balance on one leg start in a standing position then bend one leg behind you while balancing on the other 8 x research source reach behind you and grab a hold of your raised foot pull your foot towards your head while grasping your raised foot arch your back and begin gently pulling your foot towards your head 9 x research source if you feel any pain or discomfort at this point stop going further could result in strain or other injury touch your foot to your head while pulling your foot towards your head continue arching your back pull your head back until you feel it touch your foot this will require good balance to accomplish if you re having trouble maintaining your balance do some balancing exercises before trying again begin on your hands and knees from that position place one forearm flat on the ground adjust the position of the other hand by moving it back until the heel of your hand is directly across from where the elbow of your opposite arm is resting touching your feet to your head from a handstand position is a very advanced technique that you should only attempt if you have advanced levels of strength flexibility and balance 10 x research source alternatively a less demanding strategy is to start on your hands and knees close to and facing a wall then lower yourself onto both forearms 11 x research source kick your feet into the air kick your feet up above your head until you can find your balance 12 x research source you ll be in a modified handstand position with your feet in the air and your weight resting on your forearm and on your other hand alternatively you can do this next to a wall so that when you kick your feet over your head your feet will hit the wall helping you keep your balance you ll be in forearm stand position with your feet above you resting on the wall 13 x research source slowly lower your feet to your head once you ve found your balance in the modified handstand position bend your legs at the knee so that your feet begin moving towards your head 14 x research source arch your back and gradually lower your feet until you feel them touch your head you can pull your head back slightly to meet them alternatively you can use a wall as a brace while you slowly lower your feet towards your head 15 x research

how to do gymnastics tricks,flexibility is essential to gymnastics improve your gymnastic skills by increasing your flexibility learn to properly warm up and stretch in order to allow your body to become fluid and flexible remember that you can master basic gymnastic movements while preventing injury,warm up with cardio warm up the muscles in your body with 15 minutes of cardio do what you enjoy as cardio can be repetitive whether you jog run on a machine or walk up stairs make sure you loosen up your muscles slowly working them up for more vigorous activity 1 x research source add squats knee jumps or jumping jacks to increase the blood flow and intensity of your warm up form a bridge to stretch your back the bridge is a stretch that looks exactly as it sounds lay with your back on the floor knees bent feet planted and hands palms down with fingers pointed at your feet you should look like you are about to crawl on your back but create a bridge instead by lifting your back off the ground and pushing down through your palms and feet 2 x research source keep your elbows pointed at the ceiling and try to stretch your back as much as possible with time and practice your flexibility will improve and you ll notice that your back will bend more and more don t force your back to bend past its capacity back injuries can be very debilitating stretch your lower body with the runner s stretch take a step forward into a lunge position touch the ground with your fingertips or as low as they will allow inhale and slowly straighten the front leg raising your butt exhale as you stretch the front leg then lower yourself back into the lunge position 3 x research source stretch both sides at least 4 times each stretch your upper body with a standing side stretch from a standing position reach your arms overhead clasping your fingers together but keeping your pointer fingers out and extended inhale and stretch as long and as tall as you can while you simultaneously bend at the hip to one side breath slowly and deeply for 5 seconds and return to a standing position with your arms overhead 4 x research source repeat the standing side stretch on both sides of your body start in a standing position with one leg forward when preparing to get into a split stance stand with your feet shoulder width apart lean forward on your dominant foot this will be the leg that goes forward in your split 5 x research source it is best to practice doing the splits on a softer surface such as carpet or a yoga mat try to avoid practicing on tile or hardwood if possible extend your front leg out keeping your front leg straight slowly slide it forward directly in front of you 6 x research source keep your stance controlled and tight do not allow yourself to wobble back and forth or slip try taking your socks off to prevent your feet from sliding another option is to try performing the splits on carpet flooring with your socks on extend your back leg out while your front leg is slowly extending do the same with your back leg propel it outwards and straight behind you while staying upright and controlled once you begin to feel a tightness in your thighs refrain from stretching any further 7 x research source forcing your body past what feels comfortable is a sure way to injure yourself if necessary use a small chair or table to help keep your balance as you lower yourself down hold the stretch when your legs are both extended as far as they can go pause and hold the stretch 8 x research source try counting to 15 or even 30 the point is your body will learn to relax while in the splits pose rest your arms on a supportive chair side table or ground if necessary always remember that a stretch will cause discomfort but not pain if you feel pain while doing the splits stop immediately 9 x research source ease out of the splits once you ve held the stretch as long as possible slowly ease up back onto your feet 10 x research source after resting a few moments you are free to try again if you feel your body is capable take your time and focus on technique as you practice most people are not naturally flexible mastering the splits may take several months of practice be patient and don t be discouraged if you feel that your flexibility is not improving depending on your age flexibility may take a while to improve 11 x research source place your arms over your head while standing raise your arms straight into the air your palms should be oriented towards the sky and fingers pointing behind you 12 x research source this exercise is best learned with a friend nearby for support if necessary arch your back and move down puff out your chest and slowly lower yourself backwards towards the floor take your time and control your movement moving too fast can cause you to lose your balance and fall injuring yourself 13 x research source if you re stuck here you may find it helpful to use a chair or table as a halfway support you can use the support until you re confident in your ability to go all the way down bending all the way backwards takes some serious flexibility if you re stuck get into a bridge and rock back and forth rock all the way onto your hands and feet this allows your back to really curve and helps prepare for the standing bend 14 x research source lock your arms and hold once you begin to approach the ground lock your arms to ensure that you don t smack your head when you land after your arms have been locked keep arching back until your hands are on the ground 15 x research source keep your stomach flexed and pointed tight to the ceiling as you hold the position while in a backbend keep your feet firmly planted 16 x research source imagine your weight being distributed evenly on all four limbs this will help you stay balanced exit the bend while professionals can arch their way back up and out of a backbend you may find it easier to let your knees drop and unlock your arms tuck your head into your chin and cave your body this will put you flat onto your back and safely on the floor place your hands flat on the ground you want your hands to be hip distance apart and fingers pointing towards the wall picture your fingers a couple inches from the wall 17 x research source prepare yourself mentally by visualizing the movement while focusing on your breathing keep your elbows and wrists locked strong you may fall on your face if your arms are flimsy and soft when you transition into the handstand 18 x research source the handstand is one of the core techniques used in gymnastics mastering this skill will allow you to move on to walkovers handsprings and other flip movements learning how to handstand will also be vital for transitioning between bars and floors 19 x research source be patient while practicing the movement can be disorientating and may need time to build the strength needed to complete the movement lock and fling your legs up keep your back against the wall for stability from here lock your knees and kick them up 20 x research source don t be let down if you are leaning completely against the wall keep your abdominal and arm muscles strong and engaged to keep your back strong point your toes and hold imagine pointing your toes straight towards the sky flexing your ankles point your toes up if you re doing it correctly the balls of your feet should be pointed towards the wall that is supporting you 21 x research source hold for as long as you can in time your muscles will strengthen and you will be able to hold the hand stand for longer periods keep your chin tucked into your chest and face towards the wall this will protect your neck in case of a fall 22 x research source the rest of your body should feel strong and solid keep your back and arms completely straight and strong 23 x research source release and come down relax your ankles and swing your legs back towards the ground bend the knee in preparation for hitting the ground allow the blood to rush back to your head before trying again once you ve mastered 8 reps of 30 seconds each try moving away from the wall and doing a free stand handstand 24 x research source familiarize yourself with the trampoline professional trampolines are different than the ones used at home whether using a recreational trampoline or practicing at a professional facility always familiarize yourself with the power of the equipment professional equipment can generate much more bounce than ordinary trampolines ensure that you have a qualified attendant supervising you or your kids when using professional equipment 25 x research source perform a tuck jump jump up as high as you can on the centre of the trampoline keep your body straight and push through your arms up over head to maximize the strength of your entire body at the peak of your jump touch your knees to your chest and hold as gravity begins to bring you down kick your legs back out underneath you before landing back onto the trampoline 26 x research source move on to the straddle jump jump on the centre of the trampoline and push your legs straight underneath you as you reach the peak of your jump kick your legs forward and out so that they form a v in front of you bend your back and reach to your toes as you do this as gravity begins to bring you down brace yourself by bringing your legs back together and forcing your hands to your sides 27 x research source perform a pike jump jump at the centre of the trampoline and push through your legs and out through your arms as you reach the peak of your jump your arms should be over your head and pointed towards the sky push your hands forward while you simultaneously bring your legs in front of you try to touch your toes while keeping your legs straight bring your legs back down and arms to the side to brace yourself to land 28 x research source combine your jumps generate more power with each successive jump and practice executing different jumps as your height increases the more height you get the easier it will be to focus on technique 29 x research source mount the balance beam with straight legs when you first get on the

will help you absorb your landing at this time your other leg will move into a vertical position end the walkover properly shift your weight back to your leading leg as it touches down then push off the ground with your hands you should end in the same position you started in make sure that you plant your feet as you land keep your arms flexed when you land use your abdominal muscles in order to come back into a standing position it can be tempting to put your chin to your chest and pull your arms forward to help you get up but you should actually keep your head back and just use your stomach muscles to pull you up make sure that you do each step in a continuous motion fluidity of movement is very important if you can get up from a bridge and still can t do a front walkover that probably means your feet need to be closer to your head when you land make sure to stay in the proper form you should press your hips forward and make sure that you don t stand up too fast that could make you fall backwards your natural momentum is very important and will push you upright your head and arms should be the last to come into their final position after you master a basic front walkover you can

fun can help strengthen your ability to make your body do amazing things consider giving one of these ideas a try take dance lessons try hip hop salsa or beginner s ballet if you don t want to take

improve your flexibility too be willing to work your hardest the willingness to work hard day in and day out is a hallmark of every successful gymnast getting good at gymnastics moves takes so much practice that there s really no way to avoid working hard even amateur gymnasts might train as often as four hours a day four times a week with light practice and stretching on days in between in addition to working hard if you end up deciding you want to pursue professional gymnastics you may have to make some sacrifices you probably won t have time for other extracurriculars and your social time will be limited since you ll have to stay in good shape for practice and competitions aim for perfection every move must be practiced over and over until you execute it perfectly if you re not a perfectionist this repetition might get frustrating however it s your coach s job to help you reach perfection since in a competition every movement you make will be judged having perfect form is also the best way to keep yourself from getting injured a bent knee or waist could throw you off balance just enough to cause a bad fall from the balance beam gymnasts have a reputation for being determined perfectionists but this approach to life can backfire as well don t take it so far that you damage your health or injure yourself just to get a move right know your limits and take a break when you need to start early and train hard as soon as you know you want to be a gymnast start taking lessons right away so that your body learns flexibility from an early age as you work with a coach and improve your skills you ll advance from beginner level to higher levels and eventually you ll be good enough to compete it s important to develop flexibility and muscle memory as soon as possible since these qualities are harder to attain at an older age if you decide you want to be an elite gymnast get your skill level assessed so you know exactly where you stand and how much work you ll need to put in to advance to the next level if you re on the older side you can still become a good gymnast but it may be more difficult to compete at very high levels many gymnasts reach their peak before age 18 see if your body type fits the role while anyone can gain flexibility and find out what their body can do professional gymnasts tend to have a certain body type that s conducive to flying and flipping through the air they re usually on the shorter side and very slight but strong if you re growing quite tall or if your body tends to be stocky being a professional gymnast might not be in the cards work with a trainer to find out whether hard work will help your body get to where it needs to be to compete on an elite level with the right kind of training you might still be able to be a gymnast don t be hard on yourself if it turns out that your genes aren t lining up with your desire to be a gymnast it s not worth starving yourself or trying to stunt your growth don t put your health at risk try pursuing an athletic endeavor that isn t so dependent on being slight find a professional coach and enter competitions a gymnast will not succeed without a brilliant coach helping him or her along the way when you start getting serious ask around and track down the best coach in your area as soon as possible work with your coach to improve your skills to the point where you can start entering professional competitions you probably won t find who you re looking for at your local ymca or club gym in fact you might have to travel to a different city to work with the best coach available when your skill level is high enough you can compete as part of a team each team will have certain requirements your coach will help you meet watch videos of olympic gymnasts like gabrielle douglas simone biles aly raisman laurie hernandez nastia luikin and aliya mustafina to see their artistry and technique which will help you in competition devote your life to gymnastics at the elite level your life will become gymnastics half of the day almost every day will be spent training you ll learn top level skills that you simply couldn t master any other way if you want to compete with the very best you ll have to become a gymnastics expert and that means making gymnastics the most important part of your daily routine many elite gymnasts are homeschooled giving them the flexibility to spend half their days training there s not much time for other extracurricular activities in order to work with the best coaches and teams you might have to move to a new city or even a new country as many elites have done the reward for devoting your life to gymnastics will be seeing your body do amazing things and maybe earning some medals too,Sports-and-Fitness
how to planche,a planche is an advanced gymnastics technique where the gymnast lifts himself in the air with his hands lying horizontally due to the high amount of upper body strength and balance it takes to planche it s considered an upper level technique and should only be attempted if you have significant gymnastics experience due to the difficulty it s recommended to train yourself up in increments there are several types of planche in order to ultimately pull off a full planche you need to tend to the basics first,stretch first this will help your body feel limber and warmed up making it easier to planche proper stretching is a vital part of avoiding preventable injury a planche is an advanced technique so you ll need your body in its best order before you attempt it touch your toes keep your legs as straight as possible circle your wrists and hips stretch your arms by crossing one arm over your chest and holding the elbow with the opposite hand repeat on the other side get in position crouch between either push up bars or parallel bars with your hands grasping the bars on either side if you don t wish to perform the planche on bars squat down on the floor with your hands planted on either side of you make sure your hands are planted a comfortable distance apart so you ll be able to support your body adequately plant your hands directly below your navel 1 x research source placement of your hands during a full planche is extremely important to its success before you lift yourself up make sure your hands are planted facing forwards roughly parallel to where your belly button will be when you lift yourself up experiment with different hand grips before you find one that works best for you 2 x research source lean forward with your hands planted 3 x research source with your hands facing forward put them on the ground or bars and lean forward placing more weight on your keep your arms completely straight as your lean forward it s good to continue picturing yourself in a push up position as you lean forward however you should be putting far more pressure on your hands than you would in a push up leaning forward is a great way to train towards a planche as it will get you used to the increasing pressure on your hands and wrists push your body up with your hands 4 x research source lunge your lower body into the air with your hands and lie horizontally all of your body s weight should be focused on your hands keep your body straight throughout because this technique takes so much upper body strength it s unlikely that you ll be able to pull one off without training in increments first a good way to imagine a planche is as if you were doing a push up where your feet aren t touching the ground tighten your abs 5 x research source tightening your body will help ensure your body s trunk is firm throughout the planche because proper balance is so important during the planche you need to keep your body straight tightening in your abdominal muscles will help keep your body rigid hold and return slowly most professional gymnasts see 30 seconds as a good goal to hold the position for when you complete the full planche return yourself slowly to a resting push up position it is fine if you cannot hold it for the full 30 seconds at first simply getting yourself into position is difficult enough it is helpful to train yourself in increasing increments for example once you achieve the position try to hold for 5 seconds once you re able to do that comfortably aim for 10 and so on watch professional planche videos 6 x research source carefully observing how professional gymnasts planche should give you inspiration and guidance on how to execute one keep an eye out for the particular motion and stance in which the professionals execute their planche having a firm visual reference will help you figure out the specifics yourself it may look very easy when professionals planche but it is in fact an extremely difficult process even professional gymnasts may take years to properly figure it out work up to a planche using progressions 7 x research source because a full planche is such a difficult process it s a good idea to train yourself up with considerably easier positions first although even the most basic planche is quite difficult to pull off it s a more achievable goal to someone starting out you should be able to hold each of these moves for at least 30 seconds before you try the next step in the process planching takes at least six months from the start of your training to being able to capably pull it off you should keep this in mind and aim to be patient with your progressions 8 x research source push yourself up with a tucked planche 9 x research source using gymnastics bars planted on the ground push yourself up however unlike a regular planche where your legs would be extended keep your legs tucked in under your body this will reduce the amount of strength and balance required to hold the planche when you re comfortable with a tucked planche an advanced tucked planche will push your limits an advanced tucked planche differs from a regular tucked planche because your legs are extended in an l shape at the knee this should increase the difficulty both in terms of strength and balance tucked planches are easier because the weight is more situated towards the area you re lifting from 10 x research source planche with one leg 11 x research source a one legged planche gets you accustomed to extending your legs completely without taking on the full weight of them as you push yourself upward extend one leg outward while keeping the other tucked as with a tucked planche you should alternate between legs this will strengthen up the two sides of your body and make them both ready for a full blown planche do a straddled planche a straddled planche differs from the full planche in that both of your legs will be spread although you ll have the full body extension of a planche the distribution of weight will be a bit easier to handle once you re able to consistently pull off straddled planches you should be ready for a full blown planche attempt planche pushups when you ve mastered this elite exercise kick it up a notch by doing pushups in the planche position bend your arms at the elbows to lower your body to the ground then straighten your arms to come back up keep your torso legs and toes in a straight line parallel to the ground the whole time trim fat on your body it s simple math the less weight you have on your body the less exertion you ll need to keep your body straight and stable gymnasts benefit from keeping their body fat percentage as low as possible cut down on empty calories and focus on training cardio exercises when you re not busy with gymnastics practice handstands planching is all about balance and upper body strength handstands will help acclimate you to putting your body s pressure on your hands this may be done with a wall assisted handstand as well place your feet up on a wall plant your hands on the ground and step your feet up the wall to get you in a handstand position try to hold for at least 30 seconds getting someone to help you with handstands by holding your body in place is a great way to start if you re not used to gymnastics yet 12 x research source eat a whole foods diet though it shouldn t come as a surprise to most proper eating will have a major effect on any kind of athletics this is especially true with gymnastics where any amount of empty calories runs the risk of adding extra weight for you to carry around organic food is recommended because it maximizes the amount of nutrients you get in the same amount of food drink sufficient water 13 x research source keep a water bottle with you wherever you go get sufficient sleep 14 x research source as with any physical function losing out on sleep will be a death knell to your gymnastics efforts because a planche requires a high level of strength and balance you should aim to get at least 7 9 hours each night more sleep may be appropriate on nights before a big training day be persistent a perfect planche can take years to perfect even professional gymnasts have trouble with this start small and work your way up slowly don t give up and learn to identify small improvements in your form this is vital to keeping your morale up,Sports-and-Fitness

from anything 4 5 ft 1 2 1 5 m off of the ground put the rings in an area with at least 6 8 ft 1 8 2 4 m of clearance on each side you must have some room to work if you plan on doing any exercises that involve spinning sticking your feet out or rotating your body on the rings look for a hanging location that has at least 6 8 ft 1 8 2 4 m of clearance in every direction if you plan on doing any advanced exercises on the rings 3 x research source if you re only doing pullups or pushups with the rings it doesn t matter how much clearance you have use a strong tree branch as a convenient platform for the rings if there are any large mature trees nearby look for a thick branch you can hang the straps from branches are a good choice if you don t want to travel far to workout they re also a great option if you have a large tree in your backyard or you live near a park 4 x research source if you hang the rings on a branch pull hard on them and hang with your feet off of the ground to make sure the branch doesn t sway or buckle if it can hold your body weight when you pull on the straps you can use the branch to do any exercise on the rings the branch doesn t need to be perfectly horizontal the straps are adjustable so you can compensate for a height difference between two points on a branch however the branch can t tilt at too hard of an angle the straps may slide down the branch while you re using them if you hang them on a branch with a slope steeper than 15 degrees find some tall monkey bars at a playground for a stable easy option tall monkey bars are perfect for gymnastic straps but they can be kind of hard to find most playgrounds don t have tall monkey bars but you may be able to find some that hang 8 9 ft 2 4 2 7 m off of the ground just try to time your workouts so you aren t running into tons of children 5 x research source you can use a pull up bar at a public park but most of these bars are designed to be reached from the ground and they may not be high enough if you re doing any exercises over the rings many pull up bars don t have a ton of room on the sides either which can make them dangerous if you don t have immaculate balance use the bars on the back of a basketball hoop if you live near a court if you live near a basketball court that doesn t see much use look behind the backboard if there are two lengths of metal supporting the backboard you can hang your rings from these bars these are great because they give you plenty of room to work you ll just need to time your workout around pickup games 6 x research source this is probably the best option if you have a basketball hoop built into your driveway or backyard keep in mind you cannot use one of those freestanding rims to do this it must be a hoop that is mounted directly into concrete look for an exposed joist on an unfinished ceiling to hang them at home if you have an unfinished overhang garage or carport you can hang your rings from one of the joists this is the perfect option if you want to hang them at home and you have an exposed ceiling outdoors but you may not have this option available depending on where you live 7 x research source this is a great option if you want to leave the rings up permanently since the ceiling will protect the rings from the rain and snow a garage isn t technically outside but it may as well be if you open the door while you re working out build a ring frame in your yard if you re ambitious and good with tools you can always make your own ring frame if you have a yard dig two 4 ft 1 2 m holes into a grassy area and place them 8 10 ft 2 4 3 0 m apart install two 4 by 4 in 10 by 10 cm beams in the holes you dig use beams that are 12 16 ft 3 7 4 9 m tall at the top of each beam use wood screws and a drill to install round brackets for a horizontal metal bar fill in the holes around the wood beams with instant concrete and gravel 8 x research source this is a great option if you want to do a lot of ring work in the privacy of your own yard but you may not want a permanent frame sitting in your backyard if you aren t already good with power tools and working with your hands this isn t a safe option if you don t build the frame correctly it may break while you re using it get wood rings if you want the best grip and live in a dry climate wood rings are widely recognized as the best option but they re a little more expensive than plastic or metal they offer the best grip and they re less likely to irritate your hands or cause calluses the wood will also absorb sweat from your hands which makes it a lot harder to slip when you re hanging from the rings 9 x research source unfortunately wood doesn t hold up great in the elements if you plan on leaving the rings outside permanently or you live in an area that experiences a lot of extreme weather they may not be the best option for an outdoor setup expect to spend 40 60 on a set of wood rings purchase plastic rings if you plan on leaving them outside plastic rings aren t nearly as comfortable to use as wood but they re a better option if you plan on leaving the rings outside since they ll stand up in any climate if you really don t want to bother setting the straps up every time you work out purchase some plastic rings 10 x research source expect to spend 15 30 on a set of plastic rings some of these rings are made with non slip materials non slip rings are better than the regular plastic rings if you re worried about the rings sliding out of your hands but they tend to cost just as much as a wood set get metal rings if you re doing simple exercises and you want the rings to last metal is a popular choice among users that don t get fancy on the rings with the inverted gymnastics and crazy spins metal rings tend to be very hard on your hands if you re getting acrobatic but they re fine if you re just doing pullups and simple exercises they also tend to last forever in basically any environment which is great if you plan on leaving them outside 11 x research source these metal rings are often made of steel or a steel blend expect to spend 30 40 on metal rings purchase some 15 ft 4 6 m straps if they don t come with the rings almost every set of rings will come with the straps you need but if you re using some old rings that don t have straps or you purchase the rings separately but some gymnastic ring straps these straps are universal and any set will work with any rings they re also almost always 15 feet 4 6 m in length but just double check to make sure you aren t getting some super long straps 12 x research source you ll likely need to pay an additional 15 30 if you re buying the straps separately if your rings aren t particularly nice or new it may be worth it to simply buy a new set the straps come with velcro tabs sometimes the velcro tabs are attached to the straps but you ll need to remember to bring them with you when you exercise if they re separate pieces throw the fabric end of the strap over the object you re hanging it from take the end that doesn t have the buckle on it and toss it or wrap it around the object you re hanging it from grab it from the other side of the bar and pull it down so an equal length of fabric hangs on each side of the bar beam or branch 13 x research source if you throw the end with the buckle on it it may break against the ground if you don t catch it you can complete each step twice and set up both rings at the same time or assemble each strap separately it doesn t really matter unravel any wrinkles or twists in the strap twist each side of the strap as needed to undo any knots or wrapped up fabric adjust each side as needed so that the buckle on the end of the strap is facing out away from the object you re hanging the rings from 14 x research source you can hang the rings just fine if the buckle is facing inwards but it s a lot easier if it s pointing out away from the bar slide the middle of the ring through the strap without the buckle let the end with the buckle on it hang while you pick the ring up and run the empty end of the strap through the middle of the ring grab the buckle once the ring is in the strap and let the ring hang on the fabric while you work on completing the rest of this process 15 x research source once the rings are attached to the straps they ll rotate and hang freely in the air you don t need to worry about the rings facing a certain direction you can just turn them as needed with your hands insert the empty end of the strap into the slit on the back of the buckle grab the empty end of the strap in your dominant hand and lift the buck up so that the clip on the front is facing away from you on the back of the buckle look for a thin slit in the metal just below the point where the buckle attaches to the strap slide the empty end of the strap horizontally through this slit 16 x research source some people automatically assume that the empty end slides through the front of the buckle never do this the strap will not lock if you run the fabric on the empty end through the front of the buckle feed the end of the strap through to the front of the buckle with the empty side inserted in the slit continue pushing the strap through the back of the buckle it will automatically catch on the track inside of the buckle and poke out the front on the other side 17 x research source the buckle automatically locks the strap in place you can keep pushing it through but you can t pull it out so long as you don t press the clip on the front of the buckle your straps are safely locked pull the empty end down until the ring hangs at the desired height based on your preference the loop you ve assembled with the straps will continue to get smaller the farther you pull the strap through the smaller the loop is the higher the ring will hang continue pulling the strap down through the buckle until the ring is 5 7 feet 1 5 2 1 m off of the ground depending on how high you want it 18 x research source if you are doing pullups you want it higher off of the ground if you re doing a lot of lower body exercises you can leave the rings next to your chest it s really up to you if you accidentally make the strap too tall press the clip on the front of the buckle to unlock the strap and slide it down release the clip to lock the strap again hang both rings so they rest at an identical distance off of the ground don t worry about it being perfect an inch or centimeter of difference won t dramatically change anything use the velcro straps to wrap the excess fabric to the loop once the rings are at your desired height there will be 3 6 feet 0 91 1 83 m of excess strap hanging from the buckle every set of straps comes with a set of velcro tabs bunch the hanging fabric up into a few loops and hold the loops against the strap above it then wrap a velcro tab around the loops and the strap to keep the hanging length from getting in your way while you exercise 19 x research source on some straps the velcro is built into the straps themselves if the tabs came separately and you forgot to bring them with you just tie the excess fabric in a loose knot to the strap you can also let it hang and just try to not let it bother you if you prefer press the clip on the buckle down to unlock the straps when you re done slide the loop around so that the buckle hangs at the lowest point press the clip on the front of the buckle and pull the empty end back through the buckle until the loop is undone 20 x research source,Sports-and-Fitness
how to do an elbow stand,the elbow stand is a great posture to learn for beginners of yoga and gymnastics and a prerequisite for harder movements like handstands while they may appear difficult if you ve never done one before they re actually much easier than they look the most important components are getting comfortable in an inverted position and learning to balance using the whole forearm,find an open space on flat ground to get into an elbow stand comfortably you re going to need some space find an open flat section of floor that s big enough to accommodate the length of your body that way if you lose your balance while holding the elbow stand you won t have to worry about colliding with any obstacles nearby start learning the elbow stand on a carpeted floor or outside on grass this will give you a softer surface to work with until your forearms are conditioned to the strain of the technique and it will hurt less if you fall get into position to initiate the lift start in a standard downward dog position or in quarter dog kneeling with both knees on the ground and your weight over your hips place both forearms out in front of you with palms flat on the floor this is known as dolphin pose your forearms should be parallel or in a slight v shape tapering toward the hands 1 x research source the forearms are used as the base for the elbow stand they should be roughly 10 12 inches apart to provide maximum stability and put them in the best position to make balance adjustments 2 x research source it s important to be low enough in your starting position to be able to get both forearms on the ground in front of you without the need to contort uncomfortably kick one leg up behind you followed by the other walk your feet up as close to your elbows as you can can and get up on the balls of your feet to prepare to push off the floor swing your first leg up behind you to begin lifting your body into a vertical position allow your other leg to come up behind the first once inverted your head should be in alignment with the rest of the body positioned between the forearms with your gaze fixed down on the hands rather than to the rear of the body extend both legs toward the ceiling so that the body is completely upright straighten your knees and point your toes for proper alignment 3 x research source 4 x research source learn to get a feel for how hard to kick up with your first leg not kicking hard enough will cause you to fall right back down into your starting position while kicking up with too much force might make you to overshoot your balance point and can potentially lead to shoulder injuries if the arms are wrenched behind you 5 x research source keeping the body perfectly aligned from head to toe will make balancing easier by preventing any awkward displacements of weight from pulling you down maintain your balance using your forearms after you re inverted and upright you ve completed the hardest part of the movement now all you need to do is hold the position by maintaining your balance keep your body tight and use small adjustments of your forearms to keep the body from falling off its axis take advantage of your base by using the entire forearm to keep balance this will feel unusual at first but is a very stable position as long as the body is kept in line 6 x research source if your body is leaning too far forward press with the palms to counter the movement if you find yourself falling backwards tense the core by squeezing the abdominal muscles and thrust your elbows into the floor while extending your shoulders the straighter you can keep your body the more effortless balancing will be practice headstands it s recommended that you master the basic headstand before moving on to the elbow stand which removes the crown as a balance point try doing a few headstands a day during your training sessions and work up in short intervals until you can hold the position for a minute or longer the headstand makes use of the same muscle groups as the elbow stand and also serves as good inversion practice 7 x research source bridge the gap between the headstand and elbow stand by doing yoga headstands in which the forearms are also used for base stability and balance 8 x research source get used to being upside down if you re scared of getting inverted or becoming disoriented once you re in position you may need do some conditioning to get yourself used to being upside down this can be accomplished by simply spending more time with the head below the body inch your way up into a steep dolphin pose practice basic headstands against the wall with a pillow support or hang off the edge of your bed until inversion is no longer intimidating or uncomfortable 9 x research source you can also perform elbow stands against the wall to build up the amount of time you re able to spend inverted under tension this will take the balance aspect out of the movement and allow you to focus on building up the shoulder and core strength necessary to hold the elbow stand for longer 10 x research source stretch your neck and shoulders you should always warm up and stretch lightly before any type of physical activity but this goes double for complex and challenging postures like the elbow stand stretching the neck and shoulders thoroughly prior to practicing elbow stands will ensure that you have full mobility of the muscles making it easier to get into and hold the position stretching also reduces your risk of injury by making the joints more supple 11 x research source stretch the shoulders and neck independently by putting them through their maximal range of motion or by transitioning through a sequence of other yoga postures perform push ups to increase shoulder strength shoulder strength is an essential function to the stability of the elbow stand to build strength in the shoulders perform standard push ups and push up variations that target the muscles of the shoulders specifically while doing these exercises concentrate on moving your weight in a slow controlled manner 12 x research source pike and hindu push ups approximate the positioning of the body during the elbow stand particularly well 13 x research source 14 x research source holding handstands against a wall will also be useful for building the necessary supporting strength in the arms and shoulders hold static positions to condition the core muscles the shoulders support your body but the core does most of the work in keeping your body in a straight line and maintaining balance for this reason core exercises like crunches v sits and leg lifts should be utilized when performed statically the core muscles will spend more time in a contracted state which translates directly to the constant tension of an elbow stand 15 x research source to perform static core exercises begin the exercise normally and then hold it in the hardest portion of the movement for crunches this will be in a full crunch for v sits and leg lifts the legs should be kept at about a 45 degree angle to the body etc incorporate core strength exercises into your weekly training following your regular workouts pike into the elbow stand to add another degree of difficulty to the elbow stand once you ve got it down try entering the posture from a pike rather than kicking up one leg at a time keep both feet together and bring them as close to the forearms as you can then lean forward to place your center of gravity over your forearm base engage the core and lift both legs off floor keeping them together as you extend into the inversion the piked entry is an intensified technique that requires loads of upper body and core strength to pull off correctly 16 x research source the pike shifts emphasis to the frontal abdominals meaning that your core muscles need to be quite well developed enter the elbow stand from a standing position the simplest positions for entering into an elbow stand demand that you be close to the floor so doing an elbow stand from a standing position means that your technique stability and balance must be spot on start in a walking stance with one foot slightly in front of the other the leg you intend to kick up with should be in the back bend at the hips reaching down to place the forearms on the ground as you lift with the back leg in one continuous movement the technical complexity of this variation makes it ideal for beginning to learn handstands it may be helpful to catch your weight with your hands before resting the forearms on the ground in order to compensate for the added distance between your body and the floor practice separating your legs when you feel like your ability to balance in an elbow stand is coming along you can gradually relax and separate the legs until they re flared bring the toes of one leg horizontally toward the floor with the knee straightened while letting the other fall behind the body so that the sole of the foot is pointed ahead of you split leg inversions are typically reserved for high level yoga practitioners and demonstrate superb understanding and control of the body s balancing mechanics 17 x research source staying upright will be made much more complicated as the legs now must move independently to offset one another s weight 18 x research source perform a scorpion elbow stand one of the most advanced techniques in yoga dance and gymnastics pulling off a scorpion requires that the practitioner arch their back to bring the feet as close as possible to the back of the head this will be especially hard while maintaining an elbow stand scorpion inversion demand great flexibility agility and strength once you re able to achieve this posture you can consider yourself as having mastered the elbow stand 19 x research source to successfully perform a scorpion the neck back hip flexors and quadriceps must be warmed up and limber make sure you re on an intensive stretching regimen to build up flexibility before attempting the scorpion 20 x research source this technique places the neck and back in an awkward position making falls potentially dangerous if you find yourself falling always come out of the posture by gradually straightening the back and bringing the hips down until your feet rest on the ground beneath you,Sports-and-Fitness
how to teach cartwheels,maybe you re an expert cartwheeler able to go around and around in a big cartwheel circle but you aren t sure how to teach your students your friends or your siblings how to do a cartwheel with the right method you will be cartwheeling around the room with a partner in no time,find an open area with high ceilings make sure you give the person you are teaching lots of space to jump and tumble around place an exercise mat or a yoga mat on the ground 1 x research source place a couch cushion on the mat try to use a wide cushion that can lay flat on the ground you can also use a gymnastic mat which you can buy at sporting goods stores go for a gym mat that is long and at least 6 inches wide have them stand on one side of the cushion stand or squat across from her so you can guide her through the exercise place her hands flat on the cushion her hands should be sideways perpendicular to her hips 2 x research source instruct her to then place weight into her hands and bend her elbows tell her to hop over to the other side of the cushion notice which direction she placed her hands as she hopped over if she pointed her fingers to the right she is likely a right footed cartwheeler if she pointed her fingers to the left she is likely a left footed cartwheeler 3 x research source this will help you to determine which foot she should lead with in her cartwheel have her practice going over the cushion you can move the cushion so one side is against a wall this may make it easier for her to feel comfortable cartwheeling over the cushion if she can lean against a wall make sure she leads with her right foot as she tries to cartwheel over the cushion find an open area with high ceilings place an exercise mat or a yoga mat on the ground 4 x research source place a sticker or a stamp on her preferred starting leg if she is a right foot cartwheeler place the sticker on her right foot if she is a left foot cartwheeler place the sticker on her left foot instruct her to place her sticker foot in front have her bend her legs slightly and make sure her feet are in line with each other in a lunge position tell her to draw an imaginary line from the heel of her front foot to the big toe of her back foot place her hands on the floor in the sideways position her hands should be perpendicular to her body 5 x research source instruct her to put the weight into her hands bend her elbows slightly and kick her feet over you may have to support her by holding on to her legs as she tries to go over on her first few tries make sure she finishes the cartwheel with her sticker foot behind her have her check to see if the sticker disappeared or landed behind her front foot place an exercise mat or a yoga mat down in an open space make sure it is long enough for the person to cartwheel across it 6 x research source you can also use a carpeted area as long as there are no breakable objects or obstacles around take a two foot long piece of masking tape place it on the mat or carpet so it forms a straight vertical line have her stand on one end of the line make sure her leading foot is in front and her other foot is in line behind her in the lunge position instruct her to place her hands down onto the line her hands should be sideways perpendicular to her body 7 x research source support her as she cartwheels on the line make sure she is placing weight into her hands as she rotates over the line should help her stay straight as she cartwheels check that she lands with both feet on the line her leading foot should now be her back foot find an open space with high ceilings place two exercise mats side by side or use a carpeted area take three hula hoops and place them down side by side against a wall 8 x research source take the chalk in the middle hula hoop draw two large hands these can be rough one large circle and three small circles the hands will act as a marker for the person learning to cartwheel have her stand with her lead foot outside of the first hula hoop her back leg should be inside the first hula hoop instruct her to bend her legs so she is in a lunge position she should now be in a lunge with her back foot in the first hula hoop and her front foot outside of the hula hoop about an inch away from the second hula hoop have her raise her arms beside her head tell her to look at the hands in the second hula hoop and imagine placing her hands in the drawn hands as she comes into a handstand against the wall instruct her to place the weight into her front leg and then jump over her hands should be on the drawn hands in the second hula hoop her body should be against the wall in a handstand position tell her to hold the handstand then place your hands on her hips and help her rotate so her legs land in the third hula hoop in a lunge position her leading foot should now be behind her in the third hula hoop and her front leg should be just outside the third hula hoop talk her through a cartwheel once she becomes comfortable going upside down and using the right hand placement have her try a cartwheel instruct her to get into the lunge position again with her lead foot outside the front hula hoop and her back foot inside the hula hoop make sure she raises her arms over her head and puts weight into her front leg have her aim for the drawn hands in the second hula hoop as she rotates over into a cartwheel check that she finishes the cartwheel in the lunge position with her lead foot behind her and her arms in the air,Sports-and-Fitness
how to improve your back handspring,a back handspring is a challenging gymnastics technique where the gymnast flips backwards and launches herself back up to a standing position from the force of the resulting handstand learning how to execute a back handspring takes time and requires a level of athleticism that comes with regular gymnastics practice however regardless of whether you re new to the back handspring or are already well versed there is almost always the potential to improve your technique improving upon your current back handspring requires more work than the technique itself depending on your experience you may need to review the way you prepare your technique and rethink bad habits either way your technique will benefit from some touching up,stretch to improve your flexibility 1 x research source warming up your legs ankles and back beforehand will minimize the risk of injury if your body is not limber during a back handspring there s a chance you won t adjust properly to the flip regardless of the sport you re practicing for it s always important to give your body a bit of a warm up before the fact stretch and roll your wrists this is the area that risks the most strain when you execute your back handspring so it s a good idea to give it some extra love prior to attempting the technique prepare a soft surface for your back handspring 2 x research source a soft surface like yard grass mat or bed mattress is necessary in order to practice your back handsprings a hard surface won t give you the cushion you need to spring back and the risks of injury are much higher investing in a mat will allow you to practice your back handsprings from virtually any location work on needle kicks needle kicks will help to train the force in your legs which is needed to execute the initial flip backwards to do a needle kick raise your knees and launch your leg out in a kicking motion repeat this 15 20 times for each leg to complete a full set doing a set of these before attempting a back handspring will ensure your leg muscles are properly warmed up for the technique use a trampoline for gymnastics practice a trampoline offers a safe welcoming arena to practice your backflips if you re relatively new to back handsprings and flips in general practicing them on a trampoline helps to alleviate the fear of injuring yourself practice handstands 3 x research source the cornerstone of a successful back handspring is a handstand you should practice these as part of your regular workout aim your arms downward and lay your hands flat on the ground holding your hands in place launch yourself forward and lift your legs off the ground handstands can be held for several seconds or longer if you have the flexibility and strength they may take a long time to master but it s a necessary step to take if you want to get good at back handsprings training up your handstand balance will make it easier to control the stage of a back handspring when your hands meet the ground being used to the experience of a handstand will make the back handspring feel more fluid training yourself with 20 second handstands in reps of 5 is a good place to start if you already have the basics figured out 4 x research source train your handspring using a vault board 5 x research source especially starting out many gymnasts have difficulty mustering the strength it takes to launch their bodies in a flip a vault board will give you the extra force necessary to achieve a flip this will allow you to focus on other facets of your technique using a vault board can help you to focus on improving your control rather than putting the effort into the force of jumping itself this is particularly helpful if you have difficulty with the initial leap squat against a wall 6 x research source squatting against a wall is a common way to build leg strength rest your back against wall and lower your body down this will cause a bend in your legs get your squat down to the point where your legs are arched at a 90 degree angle this should cause a noticeable burn in your leg muscles if your legs are stronger you ll be able to leap higher giving your back handspring greater initial force hold your squat for 30 seconds then give yourself 30 seconds to rest before you attempt another rep enlist the help of a coach 7 x research source sports coaches have the experience and training to notice issues with your technique that you or your friends might not pick up on whether at a subscription gym or as part of a gymnastics team getting help from a coach can take you from being good to great it is especially helpful if you have a positive working relationship with the coach many coaches find satisfaction in seeing their students thrive this can have a positive moralizing effect on you if you re feeling frustrated by the learning curve having a coach around can also help limit the risk of personal injury if he doubles as a spotter keep your back relatively straight throughout the back handspring 8 x research source keep your back as straight as you can throughout your back handspring be sure not to undercut it s a common mistake for beginning gymnasts to bend their backs too far as they execute this maneuver unfortunately this makes it more difficult for your body s weight to complete the flip and you have an increased risk of injury if your spine is at an unnecessary arc launch yourself from a squatting position if you have had some training doing wall squats the wall squat position is the stance you ll want to be in as you launch yourself backwards bring your legs to a near 90 degree angle this will maximize your body s force as you launch upwards keep your head straight and level 9 x research source keep your head straight throughout the back handspring this reduces the risk of injury it also helps ensure that your weigh is evenly displaced on both sides if your head is turned one way or another you will have a tendency to shift your body s weight in that direction record your technique on video 10 x research source if you record yourself executing a back handspring on video you ll be able to see yourself do it from an exterior perspective this will offer you the opportunity of analyzing your technique objectively there may be things you notice yourself doing on video that you weren t conscious about when you were doing it combine back handsprings with other techniques 11 x research source once you get the hang of traditional back handsprings you can solidify your skill by combining it with other techniques tumbling and round offs are just a couple of the techniques gymnasts tend to combine back handsprings with although juggling multiple techniques at once ups the challenge you ll know you have mastered the handspring itself when you re able to combine it with ease sleep at a regular time each night 12 x research source even if you re not actively training you ll do yourself a disservice by cutting short on sleep regular sufficient sleep is especially important if you re into athletics getting between 7 9 hours is optimal although you may want more if you have a particularly straining athletics test the next day with proper rest you ll be able to execute greater back handsprings with less conscious effort train with a partner 13 x research source training and exercising are far more satisfying when they re done with a partner if you have a friend who is training in the same skills you are you ll be able to help each other one of you can act as a spotter while the other executes the techniques above all the moralizing aspect of training as a team will push you past the boundaries you thought you had drink sufficient water 14 x research source water is vital for all athletic exercises and it s especially important in gymnastics drinking ample water helps to ensure that your joints are lubricated if you re dehydrated your body won t function at the level it should ample water intake will loosen up your joints giving your body greater flexibility when you attempt a back handspring some athletes believe you should multiply your body weight by 0 6 to arrive at the number of ounces you should be drinking each day if you re wanting to get serious about athletics 15 x research source believe in yourself 16 x research source although believing in oneself sounds like cheap advice there are few places it means more than in athletics if you feel like you re not cut out for a back handspring you ll have a low chance of pulling it off regardless of your physical aptitude go into each training session with a positive outlook you should take comfort in the fact you are going out of your way to hone your body and improve yourself back handsprings are difficult and require a fair amount of focus on the part of the gymnast if you have issues with self confidence clearing up the emotional aspect will see tangible improvements in your

how to do a straddle split,the straddle splits is also known as the middle splits and can be very difficult to achieve it requires a lot of flexibility in your legs which can only be achieved with practice remember to always warm up your body and take advantage of yoga poses to help your body prepare for the intense stretch the middle splits requires flexibility in your hip flexors groin quadriceps and hamstrings,warm up it is important to warm up your muscles and stretch to ensure that you do not injure yourself you must especially stretch and warm up your legs and back as they will be primarily involved in performing the straddle splits position yourself against a wall lay on your back with your legs in the air and your butt against a wall keep your back straight and flat as your press against the wall for support wear comfortable clothing and shoes for mobility and traction lay on a mat or pillow if the ground is uncomfortable for your back 1 x research source you will need shoes with good traction in order to walk your legs out across the wall walk your legs out slowly drop your legs to each side of you along the wall in a v shape spread your legs apart until they are tight but not far enough that you feel pain hold the v pose for 10 15 seconds 2 x research source move to a standing position once you have practiced the v position against a wall stand comfortably with your feet shoulder width apart and bent over at the hip this is best done on tile or hardwood but make sure that the floor isn t too slippery 3 x expert source tanya berenson

how to do a front aerial,a front aerial is an advanced gymnastics skill that is essentially a front walk over that doesn t use hands for support to pull this move off you ll need a fair amount of leg and core strength but you ll also need a decent amount of leg and back flexibility too but once you ve mastered it you can use the front aerial to spice up your cheerleading routine or even to impress friends and teammates it is a cool skill to do and with practice and the right precautions you ll safely master it in no time,master the prerequisites gymnastics skills build off of each other and before you attempt the front aerial you ll want to have mastered similar more basic skills this includes the front walk over the front handspring step out and the side aerial 1 x research source these skills involve attributes and motions comparable to the front aerial and mastery will result in better execution ask your coach if you re ready unless you have learned the right prerequisites doing a front aerial without the proper equipment and supervision could result in serious neck or back injury your coach is the person who knows your skill level best so ask them their opinion and advice prepare to simulate the motion to help your body become accustomed to the uncanny sensation of doing an entire frontward revolution without the use of your hands you re going to practice the motion into a foam pit stack two panel mats at the edge of the floor near the foam pit 2 x research source if your gym doesn t have a foam pit talk with your coach and see if there s one nearby you can use for practice perform the motion by splitting your legs and tumbling forward stand on one foot push off by bending at the knee and driving with your leg flip forward by leaning in and splitting your legs and finally allow yourself to fall into the foam pit this will help your body acclimate to the sensation of being upside down while unsupported and in motion your distance from the foam pit will depend on your height be sure you are close enough to the foam pit that you clear its lip and the intervening space in the course of your tumble generally about six inches 15¼ cm should be sufficient repeat this process several times until you are comfortable with the sensation remove a mat and practice into the foam pit again the less vertical assistance you have from the mats the more you will have to engage your legs and core to launch your body through the air the fewer mats you use the more like the real thing your practice will become flip on a trampoline or tumble track your flip differs from a front aerial in that the an aerial requires you to keep your legs extended which will slow your rotational velocity approach your flip at a run and then execute once you feel comfortable try to step into a front aerial 3 x research source attempt a front aerial on the floor with height aids if you are comfortable with the previous drills and mastered the prerequisite skills as your coach if you re ready to try a front aerial on the floor with height assistance take an eight inch mat and put it on a soft padded gymnastics floor or carpet then stack three panel mats on top of each other and another three behind those 4 x research source stand on the panel mats push off flip and land on the eight inch mat try to stick your landing lower height by removing mats once you perfect this motion then do it with two panel mats one panel mat then no panel mats protect yourself from injury while learning before trying to do a front aerial on plain floor get a really thin mat or a pit pillow and place it on bouncy floor or regular floor start off from the floor and aim to land on the thin mat get a spot your coach should be there for your first few attempts at an unaided front aerial for two reasons firstly you ll want him to spot you while you master the move to prevent you from injuring yourself while learning secondly he ll be able to give you pointers to improve your front aerial and make executing it easier 5 x research source assume your start position and begin your forward motion you should raise your arms up to your ears and lift your leading leg to step forward 6 x research source step into a lunge bending your front leg to prepare to jump lower your shoulders to about the height of the knee of your forward leg and ready your arms to drive backward drive back with your lower body you should drive the heel of your back leg toward the ceiling as you begin to push through the motion straighten your base leg and swing back with your arms 7 x research source lift your upper body while your back heel and arms are reaching the highest farthest point possible of your drive you should also lift with your hips and chest finish the motion by pushing and jumping off your base leg all the way through your foot 8 x research source land on your leading leg you ll need to stay tight and maintain eye contract with the floor while you drive your leading heel and arms through the motion keep your head back as your leading leg begins to reach the floor 9 x research source as your leading foot finds the floor your trailing leg will follow keep your form tight and use your following leg as a counter weight to pull your torso upright keep your head back throughout return to the neutral position and step forward as you approach the upright position you will again find your balance your arms should finish circling by your ears as your trailing leg descends then step forward onto your trailing leg in a controlled fashion to complete the
