consumers by making it easy to access your business through both computers and mobile devices 11 x research source create a website and establish social media accounts to interact with suppliers and consumers through your website consumers should be able to learn about the process contact you search for products services easily create accounts and place orders billing and order fulfillment

may not be the best course of action be receptive to feedback from both consumers and suppliers prepare yourself to adjust your business accordingly to better suit the needs of those you re in trade with watch both sides of your business carefully to determine how well your current process works and where you might need to improve consider asking the parties you work with to rate the experience or answer a few survey questions about it make your business practices transparent people like to know that they can trust the businesses they work through make it clear to your suppliers and buyers how you run your business and how the money flows when asked let your consumers know the source of your supply many buyers express an interest in this information so that they can determine whether or not they wish to support a supplier s business practices break down the cost for your buyers so that they understand exactly where the money is going this can prevent them from feeling betrayed later

how to say no to your boss,saying no to a request can be a difficult thing especially when the person making the request is your boss even if you try your best to do everything the boss asks there are times when you can t and have to say no think through your reasons and have a clear picture of what you want to say before you approach your boss rather than giving a straight out no search first for positive alternatives to suggest,write down a list of reasons why you cannot complete the request if your boss has asked you to take on some extra work or complete a task that either you don t have time for or is beyond your job description it can be helpful to write down a list of reasons why you have to say no to the task calmly and rationally brainstorm the problem and organise these notes they will help you prepare your response to your boss there may be simple reasons why you cannot do a task such as childcare commitments or booked holiday time if you are uncertain if the task is appropriate for you check it against your job description 1 x research source if you already have a heavy workload and cannot take on any more you need to think carefully about how to approach this analyse your work priorities if your work schedule is the problem and you simply don t believe you can take on the extra tasks take some time to fully analyse your priorities weigh the new task up against the others and evaluate whether you can shift around your existing work just saying i don t have time could potentially lead to your boss questioning your effectiveness and efficiency so if time is the problem you need to demonstrate that you can prioritise tasks and complete them in a timely way 2 x research source draw up a list of your tasks and order them by priority and deadline sketch out how long each one is likely to take and determine whether there is any chance that you could complete the new task as well make a neat and clear document which you can use when you talk to your boss this is a way of showing your boss that you can t do what they ask rather than telling 3 x research source put yourself in your boss s shoes before you approach your boss it s important that you take the time to put yourself in her shoes and understand her and the company s priorities understanding her motivations will help you better formulate your response if you not doing a certain task is likely to cost the company significant income then you will need a very persuasive argument and an alternative that means the company does not lose this revenue if you only want to reschedule a meeting due to a prior commitment think about how this rescheduling will impact on your boss 4 x research source taking time to put yourself in her shoes will help you anticipate how she will respond to you consider what language to use it s crucial that you get the tone and language right in order to say no without saying no remember that it is essential that you use neutral language at all times and avoid personalising the situation this means don t make it about you or your boss or the relationship you have whether it is good or bad always refer to the company and how to reach the best outcome for the business 5 x research source say something neutral and objective like if i were to complete this task then i wouldn t have time to finish the main report this week avoid subjective and personal responses don t say i can t do this it s too much for me find a convenient time for your boss before you approach your boss to talk you should determine a convenient time for her you definitely don t want to catch her at a stressed or busy moment you will probably have a good idea of her working patterns but check her diary on your computer if possible depending on the culture and work practices in your office you should ask if she has a few minutes to spare as you want to discuss something have the conversation in private if your work situation allows you to get a moment alone with your boss keep in mind her workday pressures and work style if she is a morning person try to speak with her before lunch if you know she is always first to arrive you could come in early one morning to catch her before the others arrive be concise when you do talk to your boss it s important that you get to the point quickly and don t skirt around the issue you need to make sure that you are saying exactly what you mean in a clear and concise way don t spend too long dancing around it as your boss will think you are wasting her time and will lose sympathy for you avoid saying yes but as your boss may just here the yes and think that you could do this task if you were more organized 6 x research source instead of using negative words like but try to use more positive ones for example instead of saying i know you asked me to do this report but i have too much other work try something like i have an idea about how to reorganize the workload on this project 7 x research source explain yourself it is absolutely crucial that you explain your reasoning clearly and effectively if you can t make a solid argument then your boss is not likely to understand why you can t complete the task for example if you have been asked to do something that is well outside your job description you should make this clear and be prepared to refer to your job description if necessary don t walk in waving the job description but be prepared to refer to it if time is the problem you need tangible and indisputable reasons why you can t do the task you have been assigned refer to other work you are doing that has priority say something like i have a deadline for the spring report next week so this other task would take me away from that 8 x research source try to emphasise how your boss reassigning the task to someone else will benefit her and the company by highlighting the work you will be doing that is more important 9 x research source explain yourself firmly and directly but never in a confrontational or emotional way don t leave it too long if you know quickly that you will not be able to complete a certain task or that is inappropriate for you don t wait long before you schedule a conversation with your boss if you leave it it will only make it harder to re organize the work and still get it done in a timely fashion if you wait until the last minute it could be almost impossible for the deadline to be met this will not endear you to your boss 10 x research source suggest reorganizing your priorities when you talk to your boss it is important that you do not flat out say no if you can possibly avoid it rather try to find a way of offering a positive alternative that still amounts to you not doing the task you feel you are unable to complete one good way to do this is to suggest your boss helps you reorganise your priorities by doing this you ll be showing your boss that you are seeking to be as productive as possible but you will also make it clear that your workload as it stands is not sustainable take a record of your outstanding work and how long it will take you complete each task to evidence that you have thought about it closely asking your boss can you help me reorganise my priorities will demonstrate that you want to involve them in how you manage your work this will show you respect her opinion and are seeking some guidance about how to work more efficiently 11 x research source recommend a colleague another way to suggest a positive alternative rather than just saying no is to recommend a colleague who could pick up the extra work doing this will demonstrate that you have thought about the task and who is best suited to it 12 x research source your boss will be impressed that you have thought about her and the company s need to get the job done rather than just your own concerns about being overworked demonstrating that you have good judgement and have prioritized the needs to company will make it more likely that she trusts your judgement more readily in the future 13 x research source you will also demonstrate that you understand what is happening throughout the office and are interested in the development of your colleagues propose new work arrangements if you are being given too much work to complete in the hours you are contracted to work this could be an opportunity to approach your boss about establishing a new working arrangement for example if you have a long commute that is eating into your productivity you might suggest working from home one day a week which will cut down on your commuting time 14 x research source if you think a more flexible working pattern would enable you to adapt to different demands at work don t be afraid to bring this up always think about the culture of your workplace and whether more flexible working is a feasible idea clearly think through any proposal before you make it don t go in with an idea that you have not fully fleshed out,Work-World
how to improve your business productivity,if you are an employee increased productivity can be the key to promotion or to more free time if you are a business leader increasing the productivity of your company can improve your bottom line and help you to weather economic downturns either way you should be constantly seeking to increase productivity to do so both employees and owners can take a look at their own work practices in addition business leaders can take steps to create an environment that both motivates employees and gives them the necessary tools to succeed including technology that increases worker flexibility and eliminates wasted time,start with yourself if you want to increase the productivity of your business there is no better place to start than with your own workday making yourself more productive will not only be a boost to your company it will also teach you techniques that you can pass on to your employees set deadlines and tell people about them with open ended tasks or projects setting a self imposed deadline can provide motivation to work harder it works even better if you inform other people of your self imposed deadline as this will make you more accountable for sticking to it 1 x research source work in 90 minute intervals research shows that after 90 minutes productivity begins to decline to maximize your productivity work in four to five 90 minute sessions with breaks inbetween 2 x research source take breaks regularly studies show that taking short regular breaks helps to maintain focus and to prevent a decline in performance 3 x research source even briefly switching your attention to another task for a minute or two a few times an hour can help to maintain focus over the longterm 4 x research source taking a break to exercise once a day even if this only means a brisk walk or a couple of trips up and down the stairs will boost your productivity even more follow the 2 minute rule if a task comes up that you can complete in 2 minutes or less do it immediately it will take less time than coming back to it later and it will provide a brief break that will make you more focused when you return to the task at hand 5 x research source take advantage of your commute e mail to do lists brainstorming and document review are great tasks to get done whenever you find yourself with bonus time whether it s during your commute or while in the waiting room at your doctor s office 6 x research source commit to multiple drafts of everything all your work product not just writing should be done in multiple drafts instead of wasting time trying to make it perfect the first time around hammer out something that works and have someone else look at it or come back to it later with a fresh mind you ll find you can complete projects much more quickly if you do them in four or five drafts than if you try to get it just right the first time handle your email more efficiently the average worker spends 28 of his workday managing his email that s over 11 hours out of a 40 hour work week to win back some of that time 7 x research source set times to check your email checking email seems like work only it s a lot easier than a lot of other work so much so that many people check it 10 or more times an hour that wastes time instead try checking your email three times a day when you arrive after lunch and before you leave at most check it once an hour don t use folders it may seem organized but it turns out that filing your emails into folders is actually a much less efficient way to find them when you need them than simply leaving them in your inbox and remembering when you received them unsubscribe from mail lists on average 50 of the email workers receive is junk it takes only a few seconds to delete that email but over the course of the year those seconds can add up to hours apply the same productivity boosting techniques that you use once you ve learned how to boost your own productivity you can take what works for you and apply it if possible to your work force encourage breaks telling your employees to take breaks may not work so create them celebrate birthdays have weekly group activities organize team lunches create an email policy if employees want an immediate response they should call one another or visit one another s office expecting email to be read immediately leads to constant email checking which wastes time set deadlines even for extremely long term or open ended projects your employees will work with more motivation if you create goals and deadlines for them to meet along the way give employees access to a gym having an office gym or giving employees automatic membership to a nearby gym can increase exercise and productivity you can also use monthly challenges to boost participation allow for remote work and flexible hours it doesn t matter where and when work gets done so long as it gets done research by gallup shows that employees who work remotely part of the time are more engaged and actually work longer hours give your employees the flexibility to do their work when and where they work best 8 x research source show appreciation for your employees workers who feel appreciated will be more motivated and productive praise employees publicly during meetings give spot awards profile employees and their work in company publications 9 x research source if an employee puts in extra work on a project recognize this if you fail to reward hard work your employees will not work as hard 10 x research source create a culture of accountability if workers are given ownership of their work and know they will receive feedback they will work more meticulously accountability also means giving workers a clear sense of the direction of the company and how their work contributes to driving the company in that direction if they feel like their work matters rather than just being cogs in a huge machine they will work harder 11 x research source offering economic incentives tied to clear targets is a great way to increase employee commitment and drive at all levels of your business 12 x research source use work teams working in teams can improve work product by allowing for multiple points of view it also makes workers more conscientious since they do not want to let down the team or appear less competent than their peers finally it prevents the isolation that can leave workers feeling ignored and unimportant 13 x research source give your employees varied work while most of the work each employee does will be in his or her area of expertise doing the same thing over and over again can lead to burn out varying the type of work and the work setting i e solo versus group can keep tasks fresh as well as expanding your workforce s skills and giving them a more holistic view of the company 14 x research source invest in training all your employees will benefit from training as it both makes them more valuable employees and creates a sense of indebtedness to the business which leads to harder work pay particular attention to supervisors and middle managers who are just stepping into leadership roles they are the key to transmitting upper management s vision and organizing work in an efficient manner so extra management training for these positions will go a long way towards improving company productivity 15 x research source commit to improvement to constantly increase productivity leadership must commit to a constant process of change this process has four parts determine a baseline if you are producing service oriented products what is your total revenue per hour worked what are the base services you offer and how much time do they typically take if you are manufacturing how long does it typically take to produce your product do you have excess input materials or inventory what percent of your products are defective when first produced identify areas for improvement maybe you want to be able to take on more work product without hiring staff perhaps you want to decrease the number of defective products that require reworking establish a process of change and metrics of success this process can take months or even years you will need to test out new processes to see if they are creating improvement along the established metrics adopt and train if a process works you will need to train your managers first and via them your employees to implement it purchase technology that works with a minimum of time and effort the goal of technology is to increase efficiency and save time so if it takes a small team of full time employees to maintain your technology or your staff is constantly running into problems then it is not working for you opt for the solutions that take the least time and effort to set up and maintain 16 x research source get workers the computers they need old computers may save money but seconds spent every day booting up or waiting while machines grind away can add up across your workforce investing in new computers not only saves time it shows your employees that you care about giving them the best tools available they will reward you by giving you their best work 17 x research source provide the technology your workers need to work wherever they are workers who do some of their work remotely have been shown to be more productive another great way to boost productivity is to work during bonus time such as a commute or while waiting for appointments to take advantage of this type of work your employees need the right technology laptops laptops are key for allowing employees to work remotely but only if they sync with office computers and programs smart phones and tablets they allow workers to check their email and edit documents while on the go programs that sync across multiple devices whatever is on your worker s desktop computers should be available on their laptops smart phones and tablets as well this creates a connected flexible workforce if employees can only access certain programs at their desk then you lose valuable flexibility that could let them put in more hours collaborative technology invest in business social network software like tibbr jive and yammer and use communication services like skype and google hangouts to keep your employees connected even when they are off site 18 x research source the cloud moving your business onto the cloud makes work easier to share and accessible from anywhere 19 x research source use virtual meeting and task tracking think of all the time your employees spend checking in with one another to be sure tasks have been completed or discussing their progress in meetings virtual task tracking software like flow hitask producteev and asana allows team members to instantly update their progress on a project so that other team members can access the information from anywhere 20 x research source this allows for shorter meetings less back and forth email and thus greater efficiency 21 x research source have your employees use to do list applications these inexpensive programs like todoist wunderlist task and pocket list allow you to prioritize your tasks based on deadlines or other parameters thereby ensuring that projects are finished on time 22 x research source invest in multiple programs for specific tasks rather than trying to do more with one program programs designed for specific functions like customer relations management for instance are much more powerful and easier to use for those tasks than more generalized programs like excel boost productivity by purchasing task specific software 23 x research source,Work-World

determine what it will take to accomplish your goals each goal could have numerous strategies that will achieve the goal but with different costs schedules and resources you should consider strategic elements like what materials you will need and how much time you think it will take to achieve these goals for example if your goal involves expanding your delivery business you should consider how much it will cost to purchase more delivery vehicles how you might increase your marketing to expand into new areas and how much time money it will take to do accomplish these things prioritize your

price of gasoline for the additional vehicles the cost of insurance for the new drivers what might happen if there is an accident in one of the delivery vehicles the cost of additional advertising in the new market etc create a plan once you identify organize and prioritize your goals outline the strategic work steps you will take towards those goals in chronological format following a carefully constructed order of operations is necessary to working strategically for each of your goals you need to define a series of actionable steps that will lead to achieving that goal taking all of the

with the extra capital needed to purchase them and increase your number of employees put your plan on paper write your plan down so that there is a physical record and you can easily keep track of where you re at in your plan at all moments you may do this by hand or you may implement any of a number of computer based planning time management applications 5 x research source put your plan into

consider the plan you originally laid out and how well you are meeting those goals if you find that you are not meeting your goals as well as you feel like you should be open to the idea of tailoring your plan to whatever your current situation is make necessary adjustments determine if your goals are realistic to the time frame you have outlined you may find that your plan is not resulting in timely results or that you are accomplishing steps faster than you had expected either way you should reframe your goals and or plan so they are in line with reality for example if you unexpectedly

could be implemented specifically at your company be sensible about time requests treat the free surfing time as you would a tea or coffee break perhaps you d like to suggest that free surfing time should only be during such times or the lunch break rather than during productive work hours this would depend on the type of workplace you re in also clarify that there should be clear parameters put into place as to what can t be viewed not just the obvious ones like pornography gambling and hate sites but also certain game sites anything that chews up bandwidth or slows down the work system anything that is considered to be offensive or poor taste etc go into detail about when where and how employees could spend free downtime on the internet allow your boss to ask questions be sure you open the floor to questions before your meeting try to anticipate what he or she may ask so that you can be prepared to answer any questions especially the curly ones inquire if there is any aspect of your proposal that he or she would like to see covered more extensively let your boss know that you could conduct additional or more in depth research on any aspect of the proposal if it will help him or her make a decision have your answers ready to as many negatives as possible couched in terms of solutions where possible arrange for a follow up meeting to further discuss your idea before concluding your initial meeting request a follow up meeting to re discuss your proposal hopefully your boss will want to study and think about what has just been presented ask your boss when would be the best time to meet allow him or her to set the meeting based on his or her schedule also ask if the same time and place works well for him or her provide any additional information or news articles for your boss to consider in between meetings if your boss seems somewhat dubious about the idea have several additional news articles or information on hand to give to your boss before you leave the meeting leave the door open to questions from your boss in between meetings let your boss know that you are available for questions or discussion at any time have a concrete implementation plan ready for your follow up meeting have a specific step by step plan surrounding how online office browsing could be implemented at your office include very specific instructions how online browsing will be executed identify when where how and who will be able to browse freely online not only should you identify those areas back up your assertions with why for example based on your research your corporate mission and goals explain why the accounting department should be able to freely browse the internet mid morning and mid afternoon for 30 minutes at a time and what the consequences of this will likely be consider a trial period if he or she is still on the fence if you think your boss is still leery or more unlikely to adopt your plan ask if he or she would consider a trial period of a few weeks or months let your boss know that there is nothing to lose and possibly something to gain as a result offer to track and monitor employee productivity levels tracking will be key to making your program a success consult with your information technology department to inquire about how you could track online time sites visited and any other statistics then talk to operations about

how to work with millennials,millennials also known as gen y are the generation born between 1980 and 1995 1 x research source this generation is comprised of about 75 million people in the us 2 x trustworthy source pew research center nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion demographic trends and social trends go to source they are known to be tech savvy social optimistic and good multi taskers but they also often get a bad reputation for being entitled and having a poor work ethic in reality millennials as varied and multifaceted as any other generation if you are struggling to work with millennials in your workspace try connecting with them about their values trusting them with their own projects and communicating openly,recognize the way millennials want to balance their work life with their personal life millennials generally don t want to delay happiness in return for career advancement and as such are not willing to sacrifice their personal lives for their work lives 3 x research source this does not mean that they re not willing to work hard rather millennials will work extremely hard during their defined work hours but they expect to have their off times such as weekends and nights free from work gauge how millennials measure productivity in general millennials believe that their productivity should not be measured by the number of hours they work since someone can work for 8 hours and accomplish next to nothing of significance for the company instead millennials measure their productivity levels by the quality of the work they perform 4 x research source for example a millennial worker might feel better having finished a huge project in 6 hours than having spent an 8 hour day doing busy work or answering emails legitimize their work millennials are often stereotyped as entitled workers and such a perspective can be hard to debunk from the outside however in reality millennials simply want to feel like more than a cog in a massive machine instead millennial workers want to work on projects that matter to themselves the company or the world at large 5 x research source give millennials their own projects or a small piece of ownership over a larger project provide work that matters millennials are joining the workforce when there are countless companies and newly forming startup jobs available daily so they don t feel the need to stay working at a company whose values don t align with their own focus on being ethical and fair and creating a mission that works to make the world a better place 6 x research source this won t just help your millennial workers but all company employees 7 x research source curate a collaborative workplace culture create a sense of community by encouraging employees to work on teams discuss work with one another and take small breaks together for coffee or a walk 8 x research source millennials prefer collaboration to competition but they can also work well alone provided they re bolstered by a collaborative work culture 9 x research source allow flexible work hours one common misconception is that millennials want to work fewer hours this isn t quite true but it is true that millennials would like to be afforded the opportunity to be a little more flexible at work however this preference doesn t just come from millennials there are equal numbers of non millennials in favor of flexible work hours as well 10 x research source consider allowing your employees to come in early and leave early or to come into work a little later and then stay an extra hour or two you could also employ flexible work hours by creating a day where your employees can work from home don t try to incentivize them with bonuses it s a common misconception that millennials prioritize companies that offer free breakfast or a gym membership and while these bonuses are an incentive for any employee millennials have been documented to prefer things like an ethical workplace or a community oriented company 11 x research source practice responding quickly oftentimes millennials will ask for advice or for an opinion respond to email quickly even if it s just to give a brief answer or inform them that their question is part of a larger discussion you are planning to have later in the day or workweek 12 x research source set expectations millennials might have expectations that seem unreasonable or strange to you but the first step in communicating with them is recognizing that these expectations come from pressures they have in their current lives the best thing to do is to talk to them and try to understand their expectations while simultaneously setting boundaries about what is reasonable 13 x research source for example struggles like paying off massive student loans or trying to find a place to live in increasingly unstable housing markets can manifest themselves in the workplace through the desire to get promoted quickly respond to such worries by explaining that while they can t be promoted within a month or become a director of something within a year there are opportunities for career advancement provide regular feedback you don t need to schedule a formal employee review every month but what you can do is to provide small informal responses weekly or even daily millennials value transparency and helping them know what your expectations are and how they re doing in regards to those expectations help them meet and even exceed those expectations 14 x research source don t feel the need to only provide positive feedback while millennials do value frequent praise and transparency not all of the praise has to be positive in general a millennial would rather you recognize they ve accomplished something a neutral recognition is fine and then give them honest precise feedback about what they ve accomplished even if that feedback is negative 15 x research source establish mentoring chains millennials are the generation that s most open to mentoring and coaching they value advice from more experienced team members and enjoy having someone to talk to about work a mentor should be someone who is willing to answer questions about the job and the company as a whole and who isn t afraid to take some time out of their week to check in 16 x research source leverage technology in your workspace integrate technology like slack or skype to help your employees increase efficiency these tools serve as forces for collaboration and execution and can help cut down on long meetings excessive emailing or other unproductive workplace habits 17 x research source recognize that many stereotypes about millennials are untrue despite the stereotypes and common misconceptions there are no real meaningful differences among generations in the workplace 18 x research source in fact millennials have many of the same career goals than any other generation 19 x research source debunk the belief that millennials job hop at an abnormal rate many people have the notion that millennials jump from job to job more quickly than the average worker while millennial s aren t as stagnant in their jobs as boomers the fact is that millennials usually tend to stay longer at one job than their gen x counterparts 20 x research source help fight against harmful millennial stereotypes remember that no generation can be summed up by blanket statements just because you meet a lazy or ineffective worker that is of millennial age doesn t mean that all millennials are like that one person keep an open mind and remember that when it comes down to it millennials are basically the same as you,Work-World

how to set organizational goals,goals are important for any organization whether it s a business club or nonprofit clear organizational goals give employees and volunteers a concrete result to work towards however coming up with those goals isn t always easy many organizations forget this step and as a result things don t run as smoothly as they could whether you re just starting a new group or have been involved for some time drawing up a list of clear goals can really revamp any organization think big break things down and talk it through with your team to develop goals that you can all accomplish together,name the purpose that your organization exists for deciding on specific goals requires thinking big from the start consider the organization you re a part of and think about what its purpose is you can then use that purpose to draw more specific goals 1 x research source for instance if you run a nonprofit food bank your purpose is probably providing food for needy people in your area use that to guide your goals a business however would have a different purpose its purpose is to make money by providing a particular service or product to its customers a brewery for example exists to produce good quality and tasty beer for its customers this process works whether you re just starting a new organization or have an established organization that s struggling always start with the big ideas and get more specific state the top results you want to see from your organization with your organization s purpose in mind then consider what ideal results you d like to see from your organization since you re only brainstorming it s okay to overreach a bit on your desired results you can make them more attainable later on think about what would make you feel like you accomplished your mission 2 x research source if you run a food bank your ideal result might be eliminating hunger in your town this is a bold result that you might have to whittle down but it s a good starting point to guide your later goals for a business your ideal result would probably be more profit or growth oriented it might be to grow your plumbing service into the largest plumbing provider in your county your results don t have to be so grand if you re starting a new environmental club on your campus your ideal result might be educating the entire student body so they start recycling all the time again this might not be an attainable result but it will help you develop your goals map out the steps you would take to reach your ideal result your ideal result won t accomplish itself that s where your goals come in think of each goal as a step toward your ideal result with that in mind consider the individual steps you d have to take to reach that result each one of those steps could be goal for your organization 3 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source if you were forming a campus club and your ideal result is educating the whole campus about environmentalism then there are several goals within that a few goals could be getting a charter from your university securing funds growing your membership and having a sponsored event each one of these is an important goal if you run a business and your ideal result is doubling your sales then think about the goals you d have to reach to achieve that result you d have to recruit skilled salespeople increase your advertising and secure a source of affordable products divide those results into short medium and long term aims all goals need a timeframe think about the goals you re considering and how long it will realistically take to reach them it s important to have long term goals to keep your organization motivated but also short term goals to keep you on task generally short term goals take less than a year medium term goals take 1 3 years and long term goals take more than 3 years mix in some of each to focus your organization 4 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source for a business a short term goal could be increasing your social media advertising presence a medium term goal could be investing in more training for your sales staff these 2 goals will

you re missing some important smaller goals add some more short and medium term goals to get you to your larger goals the timeframes may change in different situations for a campus club the timeframe is shorter since the members will eventually graduate a few weeks might be short term a few months might be medium term and 1 2 years could be long term businesses and organizations usually describe short term goals as tactical and medium or long term goals as strategic write a rough draft of your goal ideas it s always important to come up with a concrete list of your goals this helps you visualize what you re trying to do after brainstorming write down a few of the goals you re considering then use that list to adjust your goals in the planning phase 5 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source remember that you don t have to write down how you ll achieve each goal yet this is still the brainstorm phase you can get more specific while you consult with some stakeholders and ask for feedback schedule a brainstorm session with colleagues or stakeholders you shouldn t try to develop goals alone especially if you have other people who work in the organization when all the administrators and employees understand the goals the operation runs much smoother so it s best to include others in the goal discussions after you do some brainstorming schedule a meeting with some of the main stakeholders for a discussion 6 x research source it might take several of these sessions to really hammer out your goals don t rush the process if the organization is large then you probably can t include everyone in the discussions you could try to break the process down a bit by having a meeting with your top managers then having them schedule similar meetings with the people under them they can then report back to you with their findings present your ideas to all the stakeholders at the organization come to the meeting prepared to give a quick presentation on the priorities and goals you ve brainstormed write your ideas down clearly so everyone can follow your points explain what you think the goals should be and how they accomplish the organization s overall mission 7 x research source it might help to pass out a printed copy of your presentation for everyone this will help them follow along and understand your ideas keep your presentation as short as possible if you take up the whole time explaining your own ideas you won t have any time left to discuss things with the group accept suggestions and feedback from other stakeholders even if you re in charge of the organization it s important to include others in the goal setting process they ll then feel like they have a stake in accomplishing the goals and be more motivated when you re done with your presentation open the floor to comments and suggestions listen attentively and jot down the ideas that your team comes up with consider how you ll fit them in to your overall plan 8 x research source this will go much more smoothly if you ve already set the precedent that you re a good listener don t attack anyone for their opinions and thank everyone for contributing you don t have to take everyone s suggestion but listen to everyone and thank them for their input all the same some people might criticize your ideas try not to take this personally as constructive criticism could be a big help in running the organization prioritize goals that the group agrees with during the discussions it ll probably be clear that the group favors some goals more than others it s best to prioritize these goals so the group feels more invested in accomplishing them draw up a top list of goals based on what the group favors 9 x research source if necessary try taking a vote on the goals write the main ones on a board and ask everyone to rank the ones that they like the most use the smart acronym to guide you towards effective goals in management smart stands for specific measurable attainable relevant and time bound each of these categories is important for goal setting keep

re being unrealistic you might say that you want your club to convince the us government to change its environmental policy but this isn t likely it s better to think smaller for the time being like getting your local government to clean up a polluted lake some goals might be attainable just not in the timeframe you ve set for example if you want to double sales within 2 months that s probably not doable however it is possible within 18 months adjust your timeframe to make this goal more realistic plan out how you will measure and assess your goals you need goals that are measurable so you

location getting a distribution contract and approving designs for your bottles milestones work for short term goals too if you want to increase your company s social media presence by next month then your milestones would be recruiting a team setting a budget and approving ad designs when you hit milestones celebrate you and your colleagues have worked hard to get there a little celebration when you hit milestones keeps everyone motivated to keep going pick an end or evaluation date for your goal all goals should have an end date so you can tell whether or not you were successful set a date to measure your progress and stick to it that way you can assess what you did right or wrong throughout the process 14 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source a campus club might set a goal to increase its membership by 50 by the end of the semester plan on counting your membership on the last day of the semester to see if you were successful for a business your goal might be re training your sales staff so they re more effective at closing deals you could do a survey before the training and then another survey 6 weeks later to see if their knowledge has grown it s also helpful to periodically review your progress before the end date if you wanted to double the social media engagement for your business within 6 months check your progress every month and adjust your approach if you have to re evaluate your goals every few months don t treat your goals as immovable or set in stone the world changes so your goals can change as well plan a re evaluation every few months and make any necessary changes if your previous goals were accomplished or aren t working out 15 x research source you might realize that you were a little too conservative with some of your goals if you wanted to grow your group membership by 20 by it s steadily growing by 50 then make a higher goal don t be afraid to abandon goals that aren t working you may have wanted to re vamp your company s logo but realize that consumers prefer your original logo feel free to scrap the changes and keep the original one eliminate any technical language or jargon from your goal goals should be easy for everyone to understand especially for people in the organization when they can understand the goals clearly they can work towards them more effectively after you come up with a goal list edit the phrasing carefully eliminate jargon and technical terms that make the goals harder to follow state each one as simply as possible 16 x research source rather than saying we want our social media roi and ppc to improve by q2 it s clearer to say we want more engagement and clicks on our social media pages by the end of the second quarter state the goal as specifically as you can unclear or nonspecific goals are confusing and stakeholders won t know exactly what they re working towards always state each goal specifically including what you want to accomplish and by what date this way everyone know what they re trying to achieve 17 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source for example don t say we d like to increase our membership this is vague instead say we want to gain 100 new members by june 1 another vague goal for a business is we want to improve the mood in our workplace this is a good idea but not specific enough to achieve without more detail you could make it we want to host team building exercises once a month and institute a casual friday policy to improve employee morale unspecific goals are also hard to measure it ll be difficult to tell whether or not your organization is successful unless your goals are clear distribute the goals to everyone in the organization everyone in the organization should know the goals not just the leaders even the lowest level employees are helping the organization reach its goals so they should know what those goals are when you decide on goals send a mass email or handout to everyone in the organization with the complete list 18 x research source if you have an office location then pinning the goals for everyone to see can help too they ll always be reminded what the group goals are be open to comments on the goals from everyone as well just because someone is a lower level worker doesn t mean they won t have some good ideas,Work-World

significantly or even break even consider getting a part time job such as freelancing or pet sitting train an interim employee if necessary if the company cannot function without you for the length of your sabbatical it may need to find a temporary employee to cover for you train this person in your duties before you leave or show willing coworkers how to cover your most important or time sensitive duties while you re gone update your cv before you leave if you have any recent job experience or certification that needs to go on your curriculum vitae add it to the cv now you may not remember to do this after you return from sabbatical if you cannot get a sabbatical think carefully about resigning you can make your own sabbatical by resigning then pursuing other non work opportunities after several months or even a couple years you can search for a new job there are obvious risks to this plan as there is no guarantee you can get another job promptly however if you have the financial

job requires a lot of time away from home or after hours work not only will this type of goal make you more confident and happy your employer may also benefit from a happier more motivated worker learn new skills search for training courses certification opportunities in new software or procedures or language learning programs you may be able to visit another branch of your company or a sister organization and do a little work for them to increase your knowledge and learn from a different corporate culture if you can t find opportunities like these you can design your own schedule to teach yourself one of these skills conduct independent research this is essentially work away from work and can be a compelling reason for your employer to approve a sabbatical if you have a useful independent project proposal depending on your job you may be developing a new product process or theory turn these plans into the most concrete goals possible decide on a specific volunteer program to join or a specific location to travel to give your research project skill learning opportunity or personal goals their own timeline and deadline so you are motivated to reach those milestones plan

how to increase employee survey participation,employee surveys are a great way to measure engagement and find issues within your company culture however your employees may not fill out the surveys if they think their responses will go unanswered while you can t force your employees to take the survey there are many ways to encourage them to fill it out as long as you ask engaging questions and follow up with the survey results afterward your employees will recognize that they matter to your company,state the purpose of the survey so your employees know it s important employees often don t fill out surveys if they don t think anything will change afterward when it comes time to give the survey give your employees a specific reason why they should finish it let them know what issues the survey covers and how their answers can affect the workplace moving forward 1 x research source for example avoid saying the survey is to make a difference or let your voice be heard since they re cliché and non specific instead you could say something like the survey addresses how our company manages productivity and how we can improve our efficiency or this survey covers how management communicates with employees so we can find areas that need more training or clarity mention how long the survey should take employees don t want to take a lot of time out of their busy workday to fill out a survey but they may not realize how quick and easy it can be as you send out the surveys tell your employees the length of time they ll need for filling it out once they know it only takes a few minutes they can finish the survey whenever they have some spare time 2 x research source for example you could say something like the survey is 20 questions and it should take you about 10 minutes to complete don t discourage someone if they want to spend extra time working on their survey since they may be putting more thought into their answers schedule times for employees to complete their survey choose a block of time that doesn t interfere with your employees schedules and give them a chance to fill out the survey if they haven t already some times that may work include at the end of a staff meeting after a lunch break or the last few minutes of the workday make sure you allow enough time for everyone to complete the survey 3 x research source if you can t have all your employees take the survey at the same time try scheduling individual or group times instead don t expect your employees to finish the survey on their own time since you re less likely to get responses provide a private space where employees can fill out their survey anonymous and confidential surveys allow your employees to answer questions honestly without any risk of repercussions choose a table in a break room or spare office where employees can go if they want to fill out their surveys privately that way they ll feel like they can answer the questions completely 4 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source send out fun emails or notes as reminders put notes or flyers in common areas such as the break room or a company bulletin board that ask your employees to fill out the surveys try to incorporate images memes or one liner jokes to make the survey seem more fun to complete as the deadline gets closer add a 1 sentence reminder to the end of emails so they re more likely to respond 5 x research source don t make so many jokes that your employees don t take the survey seriously give out small incentives for completing the survey avoid trying to bribe your employees with large gifts since your employees may not take the survey seriously instead you can offer pieces of candy snacks or gift cards ask your employees to come to you once they anonymously turn in the survey to get their incentive 6 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source rather than doing individual incentives you can offer a group reward such as providing lunch for a day or buying something new for the break room remind your employees if you ve followed through from previous surveys if you ve conducted employee surveys in the past mention the issues that were brought up and how the company resolved them give clear concrete examples so your employees recognize that their responses can affect their work lives 7 x research source for example you may say in our last survey many of you mentioned you felt stressed since then we ve offered wellness programs and trained other staff members to help ease your workload let your team know when you complete the survey even though you re giving the survey out to your employees you can still fill one out yourself once you finish the survey send out an email or let your other employees know so they know how easy it is once they see you ve done the survey they may feel more motivated to do it themselves 8 x research source your email can be as simple as hey team i just finished our employee survey and it only took a few minutes don t forget to turn yours in by friday address the survey results to boost your employee morale after the deadline read through all of the responses you received and look for common issues that were brought up talk with the upper management at your company to discuss ways you can resolve the problems try to bring up the survey results within 2 3 days of the deadline so your employees know you re working toward solutions 9 x research source for example you can say a majority of responses mentioned that our new training program was difficult to understand we re looking into different programs and teaching methods to help clarify the information while you shouldn t ask who filled out a specific answer you can still ask your employees for feedback about the issues and work together to solve them hold a focus group with employees to find out what issues to cover while you don t need every employee ask random individuals from various departments to meet with you ask everyone for common issues they see in the workplace or for processes that confuse them write down all of the topics that your employees mention and base your survey questions on the problems that were mentioned the most 10 x research source common topics that you can cover are employee satisfaction communication with management and training but it will vary depending on your company schedule meetings with the individuals if you aren t able to gather everyone together for a focus group meeting be sure to include other people from management in the focus group so you can hear what issues they re experiencing as well write up to 40 scaled questions that cover a single topic aim to have under 40 questions since your employees may think the survey is too long give your employees a scale from 1 5 or 1 10 where the lowest number is labeled strongly disagree the highest number is strongly agree and the middle option is neutral that way your employees can pick an option that best represents how they feel avoid writing a question that covers multiple topics or else it may be confusing to your employees instead split it into 2 separate questions 11 x research source for example avoid writing the prompt your manager is available and willing to help you resolve an issue since it may be unclear if the answer references one or both parts of the question instead use something like your manager is available to help you resolve an issue and your manager is willing to help you solve an issue typically a survey with around 40 questions will take around 10 15 minutes to complete include 1 2 open ended questions if you want employees to describe an issue open ended questions allow you to get more detailed responses but they can also put more pressure on your employees keep the open ended questions toward the end of the survey and only use a few so they aren t overwhelming leave enough space for everyone to write their response 12 x research source for example you can ask something like when s a time where you felt like your work was appreciated or name 2 things you had trouble understanding from the training seminar use negatively worded prompts so employees pay better attention employees get into a response pattern of 1 2 answers if the questions are on a rating scale as you write your questions include a few prompts that have the word not such as my manager does not respond to their emails that way your employees will have to carefully read through the questions and will get more involved 13 x research source avoid more than 5 negatively worded prompts since they may get confusing it may help to underline or embolden the word not in these prompts to ensure employees don t misread the survey limit demographics questions so the survey stays anonymous unless they re absolutely important try to avoid questions about age race or gender since the information can be used to identify who filled out the survey if you do need to include demographic information it may help to hire a consultant to review the survey information so you can t determine who provided which answers 14 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source administer the survey in person or online at your job site your employees will feel more inclined to respond to your survey if they can complete it during work print out the surveys and hand them out to your employees so they can complete it if you don t want to waste paper you can also send out the form online using google forms or another online survey service 15 x research source you can also mail out the surveys and have your employees send them back to you for added confidentiality but you may not get as many responses since more people may forget about them,Work-World
how to be a role model,role models are meant to inspire instruct and to set a good example whether you re trying to teach your children core values or showing your students the proper way to conduct themselves in a learning environment the most important thing you can do is to be honest thoughtful and consistent role models don t have to be perfect but they do have to show that everyone makes mistakes and that it s important to be accountable for them you can be an inspiring and instructive role model as long as you are about the people who look up to you,practice what you preach if you want to be a good role model for your children then the most important thing is for you to do as you say of course some rules that apply to your kids may not apply to you you may not have homework to finish or a 9 pm curfew but it s important to show them a good example of how to conduct yourself your children will be modelling your behavior and it s important to show them whatever you want to see from them 1 x research source if you tell them to be kind then don t let them see you bad mouthing a waitress if you tell them to have good manners then don t talk with your mouth full if you tell them to keep their room clean then keep your room clean as well if you re always asking your children to eat healthier foods let them see you choosing a salad over fries once in a while 2 x trustworthy source usda center for nutrition policy and promotion u s agency responsible for promoting good nutrition based on scientific research go to source apologize when you make a mistake don t put pressure on yourself to be a flawless parent who never makes a single mistake that s impossible things go wrong and sometimes your temper will flare up or you ll say or do something that you will regret that s perfectly natural the most important thing is that you acknowledge the behavior and apologize for it instead of pretending that nothing ever happened if you misbehave and try to brush it under the rug then your children will get the message that they ll be able to do the same 3 x research source if you ve done something wrong sit your child down look him in the eyes and show that you re really sorry make sure your child knows that you mean it so that he understands how to apologize when he s done something wrong too think out loud your children don t have to see you as the person who has all the answers in fact you can help them out more by showing them that you do have to struggle to find the right answer in certain situations by thinking aloud and inviting them into the process with you when a tough situation arises you can weigh the pros and cons with your children and show them what goes into a decision making process this will show them that you re human and that when you say no you re not just saying it categorically but because you ve put a lot of thought into it however you have to be careful not to take this idea too far you don t want to end up having to explain your reasoning to your child every single time or that may get exhausting and will lose its power for example you can say something like i wish i could let you play with your friends right now but i want you to finish your science project first remember the last time you stayed up late finishing a project and how upsetting that was i want you to get in the habit of doing your work first before having fun whenever you do explain your reasoning to your kids make sure they re actually listening because they re interested and not just because they keep asking why why why to get on your case follow through another must for any parent who wants to be a good role model is to back up what you say if you tell your child she won t be able to go to the mall with her friends if she doesn t finish her homework then you ve got to stick to your guns or you ll be seen as a pushover though it can be difficult you can t let your children s apologies emotional pleas or cries of but everyone else s mom is letting him go sway you from your rules and ideas of course you should always listen to your children and never make rules without thinking about them first but once you make a mandate or a rule then you ve got to stick to it if you earn your child s respect 4 x research source if your children see that you don t stick to your word then they ll think it s okay for them to not stick to their words when it comes to saying they ll do their chores or come home at a certain hour if you say you ll pick your kids up at a certain hour make sure to be there if you re late apologize profusely you don t want them feeling like they can t depend on you treat everyone including your children with respect if you want to be a good role model for your children then you have to treat everyone around you with respect from handymen to your neighbors you can t tell your children to be kind to everyone and then let them see you mad mouthing your friend yelling at a telemarketer or just being snippy with a cashier 5 x research source you also have to be kind to your children instead of being mean or inconsiderate to them because they will definitely take that behavior to heart 6 x research source if they see you being rude to a waitress for example they will model this behavior and will think it s acceptable even if you have a conflict with one of your peers or co workers don t let your siblings hear too much about it especially if you re getting angry you don t want them to think that it s okay to gossip about people be consistent another thing you have to do to be a good role model for your kids is to be consistent in the way you keep order in the household if you have a rule that your children can t play with their friends until they ve done their homework then you have to enforce it every time instead of making exceptions based on how badly your children want to play with their friends if you say that your kids have to finish their vegetables before getting to dessert then don t give up on that rule because your kid has started crying if you make a lot of exceptions then your children will be confused and will think it s okay to not be consistent in their own behavior too 7 x research source that said there will be occasional times when you have to bend the rules and make exceptions if the situation really calls for it this is okay too and will teach your children not to have a black and white view on things for example if your daughter is going to her junior prom it may be okay to let her stay out an extra hour or two past curfew but only because it s a special occasion if you have a partner it s important to be a united front you don t want to play bad cop good cop with your partner and have your kids think that you and your partner won t give the same answers to their questions treat your partner with respect your relationship with your partner if you have one may be one of the most important relationships for your child to see though no relationship is perfect you should show your children that two people can work together to love each other compromise and grow as individuals and as a couple you may not think your behavior affects your children especially when they re small but they ll model the relationship behavior they see when they are old enough to have relationships of their own 8 x research source sometimes you may get mad and raise your voice if that happens you don t have to pretend like everything is fine if you know your children heard it you can explain that things got a little out of control but that you re not proud of the behavior don t play favorites of course it can be nearly impossible not to play favorites when you re teaching a class with a student who is always falling asleep or texting sitting next to another student who is hanging on to your every word when it comes time to give grades students will be properly evaluated but when you re interacting with your students in the classroom you ll have to do the best you can to hide your biases so that you can foster a positive classroom environment 9 x research source try to call on all students equally and not to make a point of praising the high achieving students too much or the other students will feel left out if you are short with a student who hasn t been impressing you then he won t be motivated to change follow your own rules this one is pretty straight forward if you tell your students not to be late to class don t be late to class if you have a no cell phone policy keep your phone off during class if you tell your kids they can t eat in the classroom don t chow down half a sandwich in the middle of a presentation if you fall into this kind of behavior your students will think of you as a hypocrite and will lose respect for you what s more you ll be modeling behavior that suggests it s okay for your students to break the rules 10 x research source if you ve broken one of your own rules make a point of apologizing for it show an interest in the material whether you re teaching organic chemistry or basic grammar if you don t care about the course material then nobody else will you have to show that you re excited about the war of 1812 the canterbury tales factoring equations or whatever it is you re teaching that day your enthusiasm will be infectious and will show students the importance of caring about what they re learning if you act bored or sick of the same old material then the students will follow suit 11 x research source one of your goals as a teacher should be to show your students what it s like to have a passion for a certain subject your enthusiasm can lead them to develop a passion for your favorite subject too and this will be a great achievement admit your mistakes this one is a bit tricky you want your students to see you as the person with all the answer and the guy who administers the tests however sometimes things do go wrong maybe you forgot an important point in the lesson maybe one of your test questions didn t add up or maybe you promised you d have your students essays back on time and didn t get to them if these situations arise you should tell your students that you ve made a mistake and move forward from there swallowing your pride for thirty seconds will be worth it in the long run because they ll see that they re fallible too 12 x research source of course this doesn t mean that you should allow students to question your every move or for grade grubbing students to go over every little part of every little exam with you find a balance between being open to admitting errors and not letting students question everything you do ask for feedback from older students though asking a class of third graders what they think of your lesson plans may not yield the best results you can become a better teacher and a great role model if you ask older students for feedback about your teaching and lesson planning if you re a college teacher for example asking for feedback at the end of your class can help you do your job better the next time around and will show your students that your ideas aren t set in stone and that you re flexible of course it s a fine balance you have to be aware of what s good for your students even if it s not the most fascinating material and which lessons are useless because your students don t actually learn anything be encouraging if you want to be a good role model then you should encourage your students to do well and to work harder in school if they re struggling then help them after school give them additional resources or give them extensive feedback on their essays to help them improve when they show improvement make sure you give them the praise they deserve this models the idea of improvement and shows students that they can be better than they are if you make a habit of being encouraging to good students and dismissive of weaker students then you ll make students think that there s no room for improvement 13 x research source to be a good role model you shouldn t make students feel bad for performing poorly or to praise high achieving students too much instead you should talk about how the subject matter can be quite difficult and leave room for questions so students can clear up anything they don t understand being encouraging about your student s progress will make you a good role model because giving them a drive to succeed in your class can also help them apply this determination to other realms of their life also keep in mind that unfortunately not all students get help or encouragement at home giving them a positive role model who offers encouragement can give them hope for the rest of their lives apologize when you ve hurt your brother or sister s feelings it can be really hard to swallow your pride especially when you re used to being in charge of your little brother and sister however if you ve made a mistake genuinely hurt your sibling s feelings or just did something you regret it s really important that you suck it up and say you re sorry not only will this show your sibling that you really do care but it will send the message that they should apologize to you when they make a mistake make sure you really mean it and that you re not just doing it because it s what your mother or father told you to do either say i m so sorry for what i did instead of i m sorry you got so mad at me to show that you re accountable for your actions be the more mature sibling if you want to be a good role model then you can t be the one throwing the temper tantrums kicking the wall or yelling at your parents your little sibling will want to be just like you and it s up to you to act mature and take the high road instead of acting like a baby though you can t always be mature and reasonable you can try to set a good precedent so your sibling knows how to act if you re in a fight with your sibling don t stoop to his level and name call or start crying and act more mature instead this can be tricky especially if there s not a huge age difference still try to be more mature even when you re upset and your sibling will try to do the same show that you re not perfect if you re an older sibling then you may have this idea of yourself as being a shining flawless example for your sibling at all times though this can be true in some cases you should take the pressure off yourself and recognize that you re only human when you ve done something wrong you can talk to your sibling about the behavior and explain what you would do differently next time whether you ve yelled at your mother or showed unsportsmanlike behavior at your soccer game you can tell your sibling what happened and show that you regret the behavior you don t want to cover up anything you ve done wrong and act like you re always on top of your game or your sibling will think that he or she should do the same when he or she makes a mistake life is all about learning from your mistakes and it s important to talk to your sibling about them include your sibling in your activities when it s appropriate of course there will be times when you ll just want to hang out with your buddies and leave your kid sister out of it and that s fine however if you re running errands for your mom watching tv or doing something that your kid sister or brother would be happy to do without bothering you too much then it s important to let your sibling have that time with you when you can you want to be a good role model of inclusion and family togetherness so that your sibling doesn t feel compelled to leave you out of anything in the future it s okay to get some alone time too though not only is alone time healthy for everyone but getting some time alone will also show your sibling that he or she should get some alone time for personal growth and reflection too if you want to do something on your own explain why if you want to be left alone for a while or want to just hang out with your friends don t just tell your little brother to scram instead say something like i want to spend some time alone with my friend jenny you wouldn t want me to be around when you re just hanging out with your best friend would you it s nothing personal and we can hang out later this will not only strengthen your relationship but it will show your sibling that he or she is also capable of offering reasonable explanations to people instead of being mean of course you ll feel cooler if you just tell your sibling to leave you alone and slam the door especially if your friends are around but this sets a terrible example don t compete it s likely that your younger sibling will want to talk like you dress like you and be like you this can be flattering and sweet and it may just be something you have to deal with however you should avoid creating a competition between you and your sibling whether it s over your looks your grades or your soccer skills you want to be there to encourage your sibling to work hard not to discourage your sibling from trying if you set up a competitive relationship with your sibling it s likely to carry on for the rest of your life and can lead to some unpleasantness down the line remember that since you re older than your sibling it s naturally easier for you to do things faster and to be stronger or more skilled instead of pointing this out help your sibling improve and offer encouragement whenever you can do well in school you don t have to be a straight a student in order to be a good role model for your sibling but you should try to show a general respect toward your teachers and your school if you act like school is pointless all the teachers are stupid and that you don t care about studying for your tests or skipping school then your sibling will surely follow suit you don t want to set a precedent where your sibling thinks it s okay to not care about showing up to class or succeeding in school this line of thinking can affect the rest of your sibling s life in a bad way 14 x research source on the other side of the coin if you re a stellar student while your sibling is struggling in school you shouldn t flaunt your test grades and super achievements either don t make your sibling feel bad about not catching up to you instead take on the role of a mentor and help your sibling with his studying and homework as much as you can don t pressure your siblings to do something more adult than they re ready for if your sibling is a few years younger than you it can be tempting to get your sibling to join you when you smoke cigarettes drink beer or do something more adult with your friends your sibling may be desperate to please you and you may think it s cute to get your little brother or sister to help you play a dirty prank on someone or even to break the law but in fact you ll be sending your sibling down a dangerous path if you want to drink with your friends or do something else your sibling isn t ready for keep the pressure off make it clear that your sibling is his own person and that he should never make decisions based on what you want if your sibling feels like he should cater to your needs he may be vulnerable to other people who want to boss him around,Work-World

how to respond to a job performance review,performance reviews at work can be a frightening nerve wracking experience especially if you find out during one that your supervisor isn t happy with the work you ve been doing even worse than the review itself however can be the days after it deciding how to react to the things you hear during your review can be extra stressful if you re worried that you re next on the chopping block luckily there s a right way and a wrong way to approach any performance review with the right strategies it s possible to recover from the most brutal negative review or even capitalize on a positive one,have a list of items to talk about ready beforehand no matter whether you re given lavish praise or scathing criticism your supervisor will want to see that you re taking the process seriously one great way to do this is to have a brief list of talking points prepared beforehand either written down or memorized no matter how bad things get a smart boss will have respect for an employee that puts in the extra effort necessary to get as much as possible from their review two things you ll definitely want to be ready to talk about are your biggest accomplishments and your biggest challenges these topics of conversation can lead to valuable advice from your supervisor 1 x research source be alert upbeat and ready to talk most reviews are a back and forth dialog between an employee and a supervisor rather than a simple one way lecture you ll probably be expected to open up about your feelings about your job your successes your struggles and your working relationships with your other employees for this reason it s best to show up alert well rested and prepared to talk all about your job try to stay focused on the conversation during your review your review demands your full attention so don t let yourself daydream or lose track of the proceedings for people who naturally get nervous before performance reviews it probably won t be hard to muster the energy necessary to give the appearance of being alert and focused in these cases however you may want to take steps to ensure you re not too jittery avoid coffee take deep breaths and if you can get plenty of exercise the day before to keep yourself relaxed be completely open a job performance review is no place to be shy treat your review like a chance to be completely frank about any opinions you have about the job whether they re positive or negative without being rude of course this includes opinions about your pay your working conditions your coworkers and even your managers you don t get this opportunity very often normally employees are expected to be much more guarded keep in mind however that the supervisor giving the review has the opportunity to be just as frank about you if you re naturally shy or have a hard time talking about your closely held opinions it can help to practice talking about these points beforehand with a close friend or a coworker you trust outside of work you may also want to try body language based confidence boosting techniques especially straightening your posture talking slowly looking the person you re talking to in the eye 2 x research source these basic tricks can help you loosen up in a wide variety of stressful social situations including those related to your job be ready to discuss your role in the big picture most supervisors love when their employees have positive or insightful ideas about how they fit into the company as a whole all companies want to be as cost efficient as possible they are always looking for ways to keep their costs low and get the greatest possible use out of their existing assets thus showing that the work you do plays a role in the company s continued success can help paint yourself as a valuable employee even if your job isn t an extremely important one this is something you ll definitely want to bring up if you re being heavily criticized during your review showing that you understand what you mean to the company can tell your supervisor that the poor behavior you re being criticized for isn t a result of you not taking your duties seriously be honest about what isn t working for you it can be stomach churning to talk to a supervisor about problems you have with your job especially if those problems have to do with their management style however since a performance review is likely one of the only times you ll be directly asked about these things it s an opportunity you won t usually want to pass up smart supervisors will appreciate polite criticism they too have supervisors and they want to be able to demonstrate that they re doing everything they can to make their employees as happy and productive as possible 3 x research source as hinted at above a positive performance review is an especially smart place to bring up things that are making your job harder a supervisor who considers you a competent valuable employee is much more likely to take your problems seriously than one who considers your work sub par react to criticism seriously but never angrily criticism is a very real possibility during your performance review nearly everyone has some aspect of their work that they can improve on so try not to be offended or scared for your job security if you receive some gentle suggestions for improvement acknowledge the criticism and move on don t lose your cool even if you think your supervisor s criticisms aren t particularly true note that there is such a thing as criticism that s too harsh or personal for a job performance review if for instance your supervisor insults you makes inappropriate remarks about you your family or your personal life or otherwise attacks you for something other than your work hold your tongue during your review and contact your human resources department afterward to discuss your supervisor s behavior consider your criticism objectively it s easy to feel personally offended by criticism during a job performance review however unless your supervisor attacked you personally as described above you have no reason to be offended a performance review is meant to be a constructive exercise aimed at improving your work not one aimed at undermining you or making you feel bad about yourself the only thing being judged is your work not you personally if you re having a hard time taking your mind off of the criticism you received during a difficult review try using a technique called thought awareness as you feel yourself getting angry sad or discouraged in the face of criticism take the opportunity to think about your thoughts think about why you feel the way you do and critically observe your own stream of consciousness 4 x research source by getting out of your own head you give yourself a chance to react logically to your criticism rather than reacting to the way it makes you feel set reasonable goals for improvement once you ve had a chance to calmly and objectively think about the criticism you ve received give yourself a few goals for improvement these should be challenging but completely within your grasp even more importantly they should be sustainable the sorts of things you can achieve consistently they shouldn t be the sorts of things you can achieve once but won t be able to stick to this can leave you looking even worse than when you started the best goals are ones with definite quantifiable goals not those focused on vague self improvement for instance if you ve been criticized for showing up late to work it s much smarter to say to yourself i will go to bed at 11 00 pm and wake up at 7 00 am every day so that i have plenty of time to make it to work than it is to say i will try much harder to make it to work on time get the help or training you need to improve it s possible that the criticism you received during your review was a result of you simply not having the skills necessary to perform well in your job if your supervisor didn t lay out a path for you to get this training contact the human resources department and ask them for guidance if your company is interested in grooming you for more responsibility take your initial criticism as a hidden compliment training is expensive and a sign that your company is invested in your growth with them look for opportunities to show your improvement if your supervisor has seriously criticized your work they ll be looking for some sort of measurable improvement in the near future don t let your hard work go unnoticed make a point to bring up your improvement during your next meeting or one on one talk and be ready to back up your claim with evidence to make a great impression after being criticised during a review make an effort to start checking in with your supervisor to discuss your progress as soon as you ve made some sort of accomplishment that demonstrates your progress bring it up during your check in session for instance if your boss originally brought up the fact that your level of output in terms of progress on your projects has been slipping you ll definitely want to mention when you finish your next project early 5 x research source keep the results of your review to yourself usually performance reviews are the sort of thing you ll want to keep to yourself about like your salary this type of information can lead to jealousy and hurt feelings if you re too open about it don t bring up the results of your review in casual conversations instead only consider discussing your review with your family your friends outside of work and select coworkers you have a great amount of trust in if for some reason you do need to discuss your results with others be tactful don t brag or joke about your results you ll never know how they ll compare to your fellow coworkers move forward nothing can change the past so don t spend time worrying about it if you continue to fume and wallow over negative aspects of a performance review long after it s over you won t have the energy or focus to improve your work instead once you have accepted the review and if necessary have sought help or training let go of the negativity look to the future seeking out new ways to do your job better than before it can be difficult but try to keep a positive mood after a negative review being visibly sad or sullen on the job can reflect poorly on your work making you look like an under performer even if you re taking other steps to improve your output it can also call unnecessary attention to yourself prompting your coworkers to wonder or ask about your sudden change in mood since supervisors know that their employees morale can affect the business s productivity this can get you in even more trouble take pride in your accomplishment congratulations a positive performance review is something to be very proud about it s a sign that your supervisor is happy with your work and that your position is most likely secure for the near future a positive review is almost always something you have to work hard to earn so take the opportunity to feel good about yourself you may even want to have a small celebration with your family and friends after a good review this is a great idea but be careful not to spread the word about your celebration among your fellow employees this can hurt the feelings of people who didn t get good reviews look and listen for opportunities for continued improvement never stop trying to improve your work demonstrate your long term dedication to your job by trying to improve even after you ve been told you re doing a good job remember that a positive review isn t an invitation to take a break rather it s a sign that your employer loves the work you re doing and wants more 6 x research source keep in mind that at most jobs there are very real rewards to striving for excellence for instance if your supervisor only has one promotion to give to their employees they ll probably give it to the person that strove to improve their work rather than one that was content getting mostly positive reviews don t neglect any minor criticisms you were given a positive performance review doesn t necessarily have to be 100 positive take note of any criticisms you do receive during your review and give them the same amount of attention you d give the criticisms from a negative review supervisors love employees who aren t satisfied with good enough so look for opportunities to go the extra mile and earn a 100 positive review next time in addition it s worth remembering that at your next review your supervisor will probably bring up these past criticisms it can be very embarrassing to explain to your supervisor that you haven t taken any action based on these criticisms so don t put yourself in this position don t rest on your laurels don t make the mistake of slacking off after you ve been given a good review this signals to your boss that your continued effort at your job is dependent on the level of praise you receive rather than a result of your personal dedication over time an employee who s content to rely on past achievements to justify their existence can make a prime candidate for downsizing so never stop setting and meeting ambitious goals for yourself,Work-World

about a social committee schedule a time to talk to management ask your manager if you could schedule a quick meeting to talk about starting a social committee avoid just putting all the details in an email because your manager may not answer all the questions you have if they direct you higher up the chain to another manager schedule a brief meeting with that person instead some questions to ask management include whether you can use work hours for meetings whether the company will offer funds for the committee to use and what types of events management is comfortable with you planning 1 x research source contact human resources for final approval if a manager gives you the go ahead to get started send an email to your human resources department to let them know about your plan ask if they have any special forms you need to fill out or a list of rules and regulations for workplace committees 2 x research source inquire about how to expense purchases made by the committee if your company is offering to reimburse you select a time that won t interfere with work or personal obligations if your manager told you it s ok to have the meeting during work hours then schedule it for a time that won t interfere with any other scheduled meetings or conference calls if it needs to be done outside of work schedule it during lunch or immediately after work so that you re not asking your co workers to sacrifice too much personal time plan to limit the meeting to 30 minutes regardless of when it is one way to keep people interested in your committee is to respect their time secure a meeting location ask your manager what space you can use for the meeting see if any conference rooms or break rooms would be free during the meeting time check with an office admin to see if there s any protocol for reserving space in your office make sure there s a chair in the room for everyone who will be there 3 x research source email the date and time of the meeting to your coworkers craft an email to your coworkers to tell them you re starting a social committee let them know what the committee would essentially be for i e party planning happy hours etc clearly state the date time and location of the first meeting and ask people to respond if they re interested make sure the email goes out to all departments so that no one feels left out 4 x research source hang fliers around the office if the email gets a limited response if very few people respond to your email type up a flier with the same information from the email and print off a few copies to hang around the office this will serve as a reminder for people who forgot about the email hang them near the water cooler in the kitchen around the break room or on a company bulletin board 5 x research source include your email so that someone in another department knows how to reach you double check with a manager or hr to make sure it s ok to hang fliers in the office select five to eight members for the committee an effective committee will have five to eight members so if a handful of people respond move forward with those volunteers if you receive more than eight requests to join set up a rotating schedule so that everyone can participate try setting up a quarterly membership change every three months the non leadership members rotate out to allow new ones in make sure each rotation group has people from a few different departments create an outline of your agenda make a list of the things you want to discuss at the meeting include things like leadership positions budget event ideas and future meeting schedules type up an outline of your agenda and print off copies to distribute at the first meeting start on time it s important to show people that you value their time don t arrive at your own meeting late and make others wait for you and don t sit around chatting for 15 minutes before finally jumping into talking about the committee thank everyone for coming and then dive right into relevant topics 6 x research source distribute the agenda pass out copies of your outlined agenda so that people can follow along pass out pens or pencils so that everyone can take notes on the outline if they want to have someone take meeting minutes when the meeting comes to order ask for a volunteer to take meeting minutes so that you can share the meeting details with anyone who couldn t attend if no one volunteers you ll need to take notes yourself include important things like what was voted on and who agreed to certain tasks avoid just writing down what everyone is saying for example write down when someone motions for committee funds to be spent on a going away party for a coworker then write down how many votes were in favor and how many were against it vote on leadership positions your committee should have a president or chair as well as a secretary and a treasurer if more than one person is interested in any position have the committee vote on it or consider splitting the duties between two people don t assume you ll be the chair just because you started the committee submit your name for consideration but be gracious if someone else is voted into the position declare the goals of the committee are you just planning social events like holiday parties and happy hours or do you also want to focus this committee on events that give back to the community like charity 5ks be specific about the types of events you want to put on and create a document online that everyone can access to review these goals later be open to suggestions from other committee members they may have different ideas of what kinds of things you should be planning for big differences in ideology ask your manager if there s a direction they d prefer you take the committee in discuss the budget tell the other members how much money you have to work with how much is the company giving you quarterly or annually if you won t be receiving any money discuss whether you want to ask coworkers for donations or brainstorm some fundraising ideas to fundraise you could do the traditional bake sale or car wash or try something like raffling off skills a photographer in the group could offer updated headshots in exchange for a donation 7 x research source assign tasks evenly don t try to do everything yourself even if you do end up being the chair delegate tasks to make everyone feel involved for example ask for a volunteer to research venues for the next christmas party and ask someone else to contact caterers make it clear what exactly a task requires before assigning it 8 x research source set a regular meeting schedule the easiest way to keep people involved is to set regular meetings at the same place and time every few weeks try a once a month meeting unless you re going to have lots of events that would require more frequent meetings create a shared calendar use your email server to create a shared calendar that everyone on the committee has access to if you don t have a company email that offers calendars use a service like google calendars log the dates and times for meetings and parties as well as due dates for certain tasks report to management after every meeting send an email to your manager or the manager who approved the committee after every meeting with the meeting minutes attached meet with them periodically to discuss your progress and to run ideas by them for new events encourage new members to join a social committee can start to feel exclusive if it s the same people planning all the events send out an email every few months inviting people to join you at your next meeting or jump into the next rotation creating an online sign up spreadsheet can help people easily get in line 9 x research source for example say something like we re always looking for new perspectives and ideas so join us at our next meeting,Work-World

the most effective strategy because it gives the hiring manager a chance to actually meet you,search for hr employees on the website most companies have websites which list their hr employees it might take some searching to find exactly who you need to talk to but don t give up most hr departments have at least a general email address listed and often list the email addresses of individual

other public areas if they need straightening if you work in a kitchen or a restaurant keep an eye out for obstacles that someone may trip over or help clean up dishes in the back take a turn at the sink if you need to try to find a way to stay busy just be yourself it s not what you know how talented you are or even what you do on the first day that will make it a success it s your attitude and

how to write a freelance contract,freelance work is common in a range of industries from entertainment to landscaping if you re a freelancer you need to understand how to draw up a contract that protects both you and your client freelancing contracts provide clear guidance concerning the work to be performed and the compensation that will be paid for that work before performing any service for a client it is important that a freelancer have the client s signature on a contract obligating them to pay a certain fee for the services in a specific manner and period remember that the

agreement is made and entered into by and between john doe contractor and jane smith client john doe contractor and jane smith client agree as follows provide a description of services the length of the description will depend on the complexity of the job there is no reason to make the description more complicated than necessary nevertheless you should define the scope of work with sufficient clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract contractor will help client throw a party is too broad will you provide food and music or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services will you hire crew to set up the party and or provide cleanup you need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do you could write contractor will organize client s party by hiring caterers musicians florists and crew to perform set up and take down contractor will also supervise these same sometimes a short description will work this works best for businesses that provide services that can be summarized in a brief paragraph for example a social media consultant might describe the job as follows setting up and maintaining social media accounts for client with facebook twitter and linkedin developing and implementing social advertising campaign and training current staff to continue with social marketing efforts if you can use a short description then you might want to type contractor will provide client with the following services and then leave some blank lines or space by doing this you can reuse the same contract for multiple jobs with each new job you can just type or write in the description do not be overly detailed if it isn t necessary some tasks are self explanatory if you are confident there will be no dispute over what work is to be performed you may want to use general terms for this section of the contract an example of general terms as opposed to specific would be to say paralegal services secretarial services or consulting instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal secretary or consultant using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract thereby reducing errors and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client attach project plans and specifications for highly technical work if you provide a service that relies heavily on technical or design specifications describing a project in your freelancing contract may mean your contract is several pages long and changes drastically from one client to the next for services such as this you may want to describe the job as providing client with services described in the

having to change your entire contract for each new job specify compensation include the compensation you will receive and in what manner and time frame it is due you may choose to use either flat or hourly rate methods or include both for example client shall pay contractor _____ per hour due on or before the first friday following the end of any week in which contractor performs services for

not provide any fringe benefits including health insurance paid vacation or any other benefits for contractor 4 x research source outline a project schedule where applicable the contract should lay out the steps and expected time frames for the project a web development contract for example might specify development milestones and testing and acceptance periods a sample project schedule could say benchmarks contractor agrees to provide first drafts by august 22 2015 after approval of the draft and input from client contractor will then provide an updated draft within two weeks of receiving

either party has the right to terminate this contract within 14 days of notice of the breach by the non breaching party client may also terminate the contract immediately in its sole discretion in the event contractor breaches the confidentiality clause 6 x research source or revise this language to reflect the grounds for termination that you and the client agree to describe who will own any product you create produce or invent forms recipes research memorandum graphics and software are generally owned by the client you want to be clear and specific about who owns what including but not limited to is a good phrase to use in this section of the contract for example all documents produced by contractor including but not limited to memorandum research notes correspondence e mails pleadings and reports in the course of his work for client shall be the property of client and contractor shall retain no ownership interest or rights therein determine if you will need a confidentiality clause if you will be performing services that make you privy to information that is confidential such as legal or medical files secret formulas or recipes or a client s financial or personal information you should include a confidentiality clause a typical confidentiality clause contains the definition of confidential information prohibits disclosure generally identifies exceptions such as disclosure required by law and states the duration of the confidentiality obligation for example contractor acknowledges that he she may be furnished with information relating to client s products vendor lists creative works business or marketing strategies pending projects and other confidential information contractor agrees not to disclose this confidential information unless required by law or court order this duty to maintain confidentiality shall continue throughout the life of the contract include a choice of law clause you should specify which law will govern the contract generally people choose the laws of the contractor s state of residence but you could also choose the client s state laws choose one state only and specify where you will mediate arbitrate or bring legal actions under the contract should a dispute arise 7 x research source a choice of law clause may look like this governing law this agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the united states of america and by the laws of the state of indiana each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in indiana as applicable for any matter arising out of or relating to this agreement except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of such federal or state courts located

court all other terms shall remain operative a severability clause may look like this severability if any provision of this agreement is held by a court of law to be illegal invalid or unenforceable a that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision and b the legality validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby describe specific relief for breach service contracts commonly contain a specific relief clause which allows client to seek an injunction a

how to measure performance,measuring the performance of your employees is a necessary measure if you need to improve business or simply build upon current success it s a process that can greatly impact operations there are a wide variety of ways in which performance can be measured whether individually as a whole internally or from an external perspective if you are looking to measure employee performance in your company consider a variety of industry accepted approaches,gather appraisals from subordinates ensure the appraisals are anonymous so the employees have no fear of reprisal a 360 degree appraisal has the benefit of accurately assessing a manager s ability to manage and lead 1 x research source something similar to one of the following items could lead subordinates to open up about their supervisors do you feel your supervisor does a good job leading the team give an example of where your supervisor could improve his or her leadership style provide an instance where your supervisor excelled in his or her job perform a self appraisal self appraisals are a great option employees are given the opportunity to appraise themselves an employee is likely to look at their own strengths and weaknesses differently than others most will overstate their performance the major benefit to the 360 evaluation is that the self appraisal is complemented by the mix of ideas from other evaluations 2 x research source leading questions like the following can help an employee delve deeply into their performance what situations have you excelled at in the past what are some examples of when you could have used time more wisely what will your fellow employees from supervisor to subordinate say about your performance collect colleague feedback feedback from your peers helps you improve at your job because they know the type of dedication and work that is required for the position colleague assessments are particularly adept at helping an employ who is analyzing their positives and negatives 3 x research source where does your colleague rank in comparison to others with a similar position how can your peer improve his or her performance provide an example of how your peer has shown job competency compile supervisor evaluations superiors typically provide an overhead view of employees roles responsibilities and work quality they also assess employee production they would best know whether an employee is ready for a promotion or demotion based upon their quality and output 4 x research source questions similar to the following may work well from a supervisor perspective do you feel the employee performs satisfactorily in which way could the employee improve their job performance why or why isn t the employee ready for advancement understand the limitations of 360 degree evaluations 360 degree feedback methods are very subjective and responses generally depend upon the relationships between the appraiser and appraised accordingly you should never use a 360 degree appraisal as your only appraisal method use quantitative measurements performance appraisals of this type are typically subjective rather than objective they are most valuable when objective criteria such as as production rate cycle time cost and error rate are used each department should have its own quantifiable measurements so work can be compared to pre determined standards group norms trends and employee to employee collect the data systematically and determine if the guidelines being used to conduct business are adequate for example you might track the amount of time a customer waits in line regularly document the number of items or reports an employee can produce in an hour be sure to clearly communicate performance measures and expected performance to employees before measurement begins training in this areas might be required compare quantitative plans goals and results when the data collection begins set plans and goals for job performance once the data has been collected measure it to see if your goals were achieved if not a baseline can be established and used to set goals for improvement throughout the organization if customers typically wait in line for 3 minutes before being addressed strive to lower the customer response time conflict resolution through customer support can be a daunting task once you know the amount of time a typical call takes it can help your company streamline the process by identifying which calls take longer use percentage based quantitative improvement goals if the company sold 500 000 worth of product last quarter attempt to increase sales by 1 use measurements to create a plan of action progress must be measured and acted upon if a performance measurement is lacking periodic measurement needs to occur to ensure progress is being made the measurements also serve to determine whether or not the plan of action is working utilize exemplary programs to serve as a guide for those that are lacking do not hesitate to change a plan if measurement shows no progress is being made evaluate employee work quality performance of employees reflects upon all facets of their work from work ethic to individual achievements this method of assessment would look at each employee as a whole on an annual basis this assessment would provide suggestions and an opportunity to improve while recognizing any excellence how much an individual is able to produce either in product or sales the quality of work produced how quickly an employee produces a product or makes a sale conduct comprehensive employee assessments comprehensive evaluations may help identify potential solutions particularly if your company is undergoing problems however it is more common that problems result from poorly designed processes inadequate training or poor management generally a review of the entire process with inputs outputs actions and deliverables is required to resolve complex or complicated problems hiring a professional assessor who can impartially appraise the everyday functionality of your business as well as the performance of your employees could be very beneficial establish random quality control checks the obvious benefit to this approach is that your company employees may be aware of the checks but they won t know when checks will occur consequently employees that are slacking in some way or not performing to par will be exposed try a few different approaches so employees are on their toes perform random spot checks on products randomly review phone calls inspect log books at random intervals solicit customer feedback client satisfaction should be your ultimate mission customer service experience can be used as a way of assessing employee performance ask customers if they are satisfied with their product or service getting an outside perspective on performance is smart as it offers the potential of an objective analysis 5 x research source be cautious of overly harsh customer feedback some industries and businesses such as repossession of vehicles is bound to have overly negative reviews develop feedback tools or forms so the feedback can be standardized and weighed equally customer feedback is always subjective and generally only from those customers with bad experiences balance any review with objective measures of customer service such as time on hold resolution of problems and call backs measure time spent on particular tasks one way to measure time management is to assess the time and employee spends on a project however you should only use those measures that can be collected automatically such as time cards or computer software for most jobs manual reporting such as entering data into a timesheet is neither reliable nor cost effective there are multiple software programs that can track what is being done on a computer this way you can investigate employees who are not meeting performance standards to see what they are having trouble with if specific employees are falling far below the average they can be singled out and helped to meet the performance requirements give regular but not too frequent feedback while feedback is important daily monitoring is a two edged sword that can be a morale buster it also shifts performance responsibilities from management to a tool it s better to use weekly or monthly measures in addition use bonuses instead of humiliation to encourage employees and keep individual performance figures confidential note lapses in workplace decorum one manner of measuring performance is to make note of how an employee adheres to company policies to monitor these lapses try the following methods monitor punctuality issues employees who are habitually late are naturally missing minutes they could be working what s worse they could be upsetting other employees check for dress code violations an employee that is relaxed on their professional appearance is likely to exhibit the same approach to their actual work clarify usage of workplace items be sure employees know how and when they may use company items like a car cell

how to reduce employee turnover,in the world of business the high rate of employee turnover can be a significant problem economic research suggests that for some industries it can cost up to one fifth of an employee s annual salary to find train and hire a suitable replacement 1 x research source if turnover rates are too high this represents a significant sunk cost for the company that can t be recouped luckily by improving the environment at work practicing smart hiring strategies and ensuring that your company is optimally organized it s possible to keep turnover at a healthy minimum,pay more or offer a path to a raise in the free marketplace cash is king if you re willing to pay your employees more than a competitor would they ll be less likely to leave for other work an added benefit of increasing your employees pay is that it allows you to ask more of them well paid employees have an incentive to work harder and commit themselves to their job while employees who are making relatively little won t usually have the same level of dedication or loyalty if you don t have the cash to pay your employees more than the competition be creative for instance offering company stock options or equity plans is a relatively low cost way to increase the long term earning potential of your employees as an added benefit these sorts of options give employees a real financial stake in the company if they work hard and help the company do well their stock value will go up and they ll make money offer potential for advancement employees like to feel like their hard work is being rewarded as a manager or business owner part of making sure your employees feel this way is compensating them fairly for their work but another part is giving them the opportunity to achieve the non tangible benefits of recognition and advancement reward exceptionally smart resourceful and hard working employees by gradually increasing their responsibility and giving them more important titles an employee who s advanced from an entry level position to a manager role is much more likely to be loyal to your company than one who s done the same job for years in spite of her hard work it s not enough to simply offer the potential for advancement it s also important to make sure that employees understand how they can advance in your business if you re having a hard time communicating this to your employees try inviting a career counselor into the workplace once or twice a year to discuss this with them try to promote from within your workforce rather than recruiting outsiders into management roles while this may sometimes be unavoidable hiring an outsider to fill a management vacancy when there are qualified employees with years of experience who could conceivably do the job can give the impression that you don t care about your employees accomplishments rebalance the work load if an employee s work is stressful monotonous or extremely difficult different jobs with comparatively easy work loads will start to look very attractive never work your employees to the point of exhaustion this is one of the easiest ways to cause your employees to start looking for other work en masse in addition it s also often financially inefficient employees with very long or stressful jobs will require significantly higher pay levels to retain than employees with ordinary duties and hours there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that working your employees extra hard can actually cause their net productivity to plummet even to below the level of productivity from a normal 40 hour week in some cases some research has found for instance that excessively long hours can cause employees to take longer to perform the same tasks as they normally would deal poorly with problems requiring critical thinking or creativity make more mistakes and waste time engaging in recreational or personal activities at work 2 x research source offer competitive benefits increasingly people looking for work don t just consider the salary being offered by a potential employer but also the benefits provided by offering affordable benefits like health insurance dental insurance 401k plans and as mentioned above stock options you can make a job at your company more appealing than one at a competitor s decreasing employee turnover reviewing your benefits package is something your company should do regularly at least once a year be aware of the benefits your biggest competitors are offering their employees if they start offering more generous benefits than you they may be able to steal some of your best employees so don t let them get the jump on you in the u s millions of employees depend on an employer s health care plan to make their medical care affordable offering a good employee health insurance plan can make a job with your company especially attractive decreasing turnover and making it easier to hire in addition ensuring your employees have decent health coverage can be a wise investment in the long run healthy employees are productive employees encourage friendly employee relationships to long time employees coworkers and bosses can function like something of a family providing friendly relationships conversation and sometimes even emotional intimacy don t let your employees jobs become a source of a source of boredom or dread for them instead try to foster a warm open environment at work employees should be comfortable talking joking and making outside of work plans with each other as long as it doesn t interfere with their work if your employees seem cold standoffish or emotionally distant try sponsoring a fun workplace outing to lighten the mood going out for drinks catching a movie or playing sports after work can be a great way to bond with your employees and allow them to bond with each other even if you can only do so once or twice a month trust your employees with responsibility people tend to work hardest and smartest when they think their jobs matter 3 x research source though this is often forgotten by even the best managers it s surprisingly intuitive consider this who is likely to work harder a mail room clerk with little responsibility or a heart surgeon with responsibility over other peoples lives try to make an effort to give the employees with even the most minor jobs some sense of importance or responsibility if they understand exactly how their work is essential to the business s success they ll have added motivation to succeed in their jobs ironically giving people added duties that increase their responsibility can actually make their jobs more attractive to them however if you do this be open to the possibility of promotion or a raise in the future employees don t want to deal with increased responsibilities without ever being rewarded for their work hire more selectively most business experts agree that one of the very best ways to keep your employee turnover rate low is to ensure that the people you hire are right for the job in the first place 4 x research source picking employees that have exactly the right qualifications and personality for the job you re hiring for ensures that they ll learn quicker perform better and most importantly feel happier in their new role below are just a few of the most important types of criteria you ll want to carefully review and vet for each candidate before hiring skills does this person have what it takes to increase your business s value intelligence does this person have the smarts or creativity necessary to perform under pressure personality does this person fit your company culture commitment does this person s life make it possible to offer the sort of commitment you re looking for conduct regular employee reviews if your business is suffering from high employee turnover one of the best reasons to find out why is simply to ask your employees having regular review sessions in which you or another qualified person meet with each employee and talk about what they like and dislike about their job is a great way to make sure the employees feel valued and see their concerns being acknowledged if you don t feel that you re up to this task as a manager don t worry for a fee a third party hr agency can handle the process for you as an added benefit these review sessions can also give you great ideas for instance if one employee who s sick of sitting at her desk all day has a great idea for putting a standing desk in the break room doing this might make her significantly more happy in her job for a relatively small one time cost your reviews should involve a healthy back and forth of information sharing don t use reviews merely as an opportunity to critique your employees they should also be an opportunity for your employees to critique you be willing to meet your employees in the middle as long as their demands are reasonable and their intentions are good conduct exit interviews even friendly open companies with great work environments occasionally have to let people go when your business has to do this take the opportunity to conduct a thorough exit interview with the employee being dismissed before he s gone for good some business experts have found that employees are more willing to be candid at exit interviews though others have found that many employees will be less critical in hopes of getting a good recommendation 5 x research source in any case an exit interview is your last chance to learn what went wrong with an unhappy or unproductive employee so take advantage of it below are just a few of the sorts of questions you ll want to consider asking what was your favorite least favorite part of the job was there anything that made it difficult for you to perform your duties properly in the future how could we avoid the types of problems you faced in your job is there anything you wish the company had done that it didn t do regularly review and assess employee concerns merely asking your employees what makes them unhappy isn t enough to keep them feeling valued you ll need to make a reasonable effort to address their concerns and most important of all show them that you re making this effort if your employees can see that their comments and suggestions are being taken to heart they ll feel like they re being listened to and that their opinions matter in the grand scheme of your business which can make even a low level employee feel happier in his job for example if you notice that many of your employees are complaining about the fact that they feel disconnected from the rest of the company in other words that they can t see how their individual jobs affect the success of the business as a whole you may want to consider having monthly team building events where employees from one part of the company work with employees from another part for the day this can help give your employees an bird s eye view of the company s inner workings retrain managers with high turnover sometimes high turnover may not be a problem for the entire company but instead only for certain divisions or departments in this case the root cause may be something the heads of this department have no control over for instance pay levels or deadline schedules set by upper management but it may also be the management style of individual supervisors that is causing the problem if this is the case strongly consider re training the problematic managers before firing them and searching for replacements the one time cost of a short management course is usually much less than the time and money wasted replacing an employee in a high paying highly skilled management position some business experts argue that an employee s manager can have a greater effect on his overall job satisfaction than even his wages hours or benefits 6 x research source in any case effective managers are vital to a company s success so making an investment in the ones you have can substantially reduce turnover consider alternate roles for unhappy employees sometimes otherwise productive employees just aren t a great fit for the job they ve been given while they may work hard their personality or skill set may keep them reaching the full potential of their role in these cases try to avoid dismissing the employee until you ve considered other roles or duties for them don t fire an employee who s well suited for some other important role in your company if you do you ll be forcing your company to undergo the costs of finding and training a replacement without getting your money s worth out of a perfectly competent employee be aware of how you present a role change to an employee to avoid hurt feelings for instance don t tell the employee that she s performing poorly and that the company thinks she d do better in a different role instead focus on the positive tell her that you ve found something more important for her to do being aware of the language you use in this situation can make the difference between your employee thinking of her new role as a promotion or a demotion avoid constant reorganization in many cases finding new roles for old employees can be something that leads to increased productivity and satisfaction however large scale corporate reorganizations are usually something that employees fear and with good reason most company wide reorganization efforts result in some layoffs sometimes many 7 x research source frequent reorganizations can lead to a culture of fear and uncertainty in your workforce and encourage them to seek other more stable jobs to avoid this unfortunate situation try to avoid frequently re structuring your workforce slow gradual changes are almost always better received than sudden wide scale ones if you do have to have a major company wide reorganization minimize the morale damage by clearly communicating to your remaining employees why the reorganization had to happen and explaining that their jobs are not in danger in any way though there will probably still be some lingering unease good communication can help keep the damage as minimal as possible don t be afraid to fire bad employees in the words of the old cliché sometimes to save the hand you have to lose the finger getting rid of exceptionally problematic employees is a must for any business looking to keep turnover at a minimum employees that perform poorly have a negative attitude or are grossly incompetent can hold your company back worse still they can contribute to other employees developing negative attitudes towards work by sharing their negative views or demonstrating through example that bad work can go unpunished don t be afraid to get rid of employees with bad attitudes if you do this you ll usually have to fire less people in the long run don t ignore workplace negativity research shows that more people in a workplace vocalizing negative thoughts the more likely that

the terms of your contract if this happens you will negotiate with the other party until you both reach an acceptable agreement negotiate any differences about the terms of your contract when you

how to avoid feet and leg problems if standing for work,standing on the job not only accelerates tiredness and fatigue but it also increases the risk of various foot and leg problems because it puts strain on bones joints tendons muscles and ligaments standing for long periods of time also causes reduced blood supply to the lower extremities which promotes soreness prolonged standing may also create an accumulation of blood in the foot or around the ankles flat feet plantar fasciitis bunions edema swelling varicose veins and venous insufficiency are all problems associated with prolonged standing fortunately there are many ways to reduce or avoid the risks of foot and leg problems if you must stand a lot at work,sit down more often while working although many jobs in modern times are sedentary and involve sitting there are still some jobs that involve lots of standing such as bank teller cashier factory worker chef hairdresser and various retail and construction jobs to name a few however there are often opportunities to sit and rest your feet while still working and being productive so look for those opportunities and be sure to tell your boss what you re up to for example sitting while answering the phone or filling out paperwork might be appropriate at your workplace especially if there are no customers around aged people are more susceptible to foot leg injuries from excessive standing because their tissues ligaments tendons cartilage fascia lose elasticity and shock absorbency sit down during lunch when you take your lunch break make sure to grab a seat and put your feet up while eating and hydrating you may be in a hurry but take advantage of the opportunity to take the weight off your feet if your workplace is short of chairs or doesn t have a lunch room then either bring your own folding chair or stool or find a different location to eat where you can safely sit down food courts at malls outdoor picnic tables water fountains or even some clean grass under a tree are all good places to take a load off and enjoy your lunch sit down during breaks make sure to take all of your allotted breaks and try to sit the entire time preferably with your legs up which promotes better circulation because of the reduced effects of gravity taking off your shoes while resting will also allow your feet to cool down by evaporation while on your break consider rolling your bare feet over a golf ball it will feel great relieve some tension in the soles of your feet and maybe even help prevent plantar fasciitis pain and inflammation of the connective tissue covering the bottom of your feet 1 x research source stand in a different spot many years ago most workplaces were made with wood floors which have some cushioning even though they may seem pretty hard to walk on however in modern times most businesses tend to have floors made from concrete ceramic tile or marble which have essentially no cushioning shock absorbency or insulative properties consequently stand in an area that s covered in more springy material such as wood if that s not possible then change positions just for the exercise which will promote blood circulation and may ease the tension in your feet and leg muscles concrete and ceramic tile will easily transfer cold to your feet which is not good for blood circulation so stand in warmer areas without cool drafts if you work outside find some grass to stand on while plying your trade or waiting for the next task stand on an anti fatigue mat anti fatigue mats are designed to decrease the stress on your feet and legs by providing a cushioned surface to stand on over prolonged periods of time these mats are typically made of thick rubber but some are also made of foam leather vinyl or even wood in many cases your

s any carpet you can stand on and still be able to do your job properly carpet even the thin cheap stuff provides much more cushion than concrete and will help your feet and legs survive the long shifts at work if there is no installed carpet at your workplace ask your boss if you can bring a piece from home some businesses that sell carpet will give you a decent sized sample big enough to stand on for free make sure the underneath side of the carpet doesn t slide too readily on the floor or else you re at high risk to slip and fall wear shoes that fit properly a significant percentage of people wear shoes that don t fit perhaps because their feet suddenly increased in size or because the shoes were on sale super cheap or because they were passed down from a relative or friend either way always wear shoes to work that properly fit your feet while wearing socks if you absolutely have to choose a pair that aren t your size then pick a pair that is too big rather than shoes that are too small because cramped shoes often lead to blisters and foot cramps get fitted for your shoes by a shoe salesperson later in the day because that s when your feet are at their largest usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches 3 x research source sacrificing style and fashion for practicality is the best strategy when shopping for work shoes always opt for shoes

knee pain and low back problems as well as instability while walking 4 x research source wearing completely level shoes is not the answer either because too much pressure is put on the heel so wear shoes that are elevated in the heel by about 1 4 or 1 2 inch most athletic or walking shoes with wide toe caps are good choices if you must stand for hours at a time at your job don t wear narrow shoes high heels are often too narrow at the toe which compresses the toes together unnaturally and increases the risk of painful bunions and unsightly calluses cowboy boots and some swing back sandals are also too pointy in the toe especially if you plan on doing lots of standing instead choose shoes that grip your heel tightly provide enough room to wiggle your toes and has enough interior

for it criminal background checks may not pick up older convictions or convictions in different states still if they miss your conviction and find out about it after they hire you will most likely be terminated you have certain rights regarding background checks your potential employer must get your permission to run a background check if you are not hired after the background check is run the employer must give you a copy of the report they must do this before they make the final hiring decision this gives you an opportunity to correct inaccurate information it may also give you the chance

worried about hurting their feelings you can say something like you might not like what i have to say are you sure you want to hear it then offer supportive statements after you offer the advice 2 x research source for example you could say i actually don t think you re cut out for management but you seem to have a natural aptitude for sales make a collaborative plan even though you are offering advice remember that you are not actually the one making the decision when you re planning your words make sure to figure out a way that you can collaborate with the other person don t just tell them what to do 3 x research source plan to say something like i ve thought about some ideas but let s think about your ideas first what are some of the options you re considering don t be self serving make sure that your advice will actually help the other person always keep their best interests at the forefront of your mind for example if a coworker asks if they should quit don t say yes just because you don t want to compete with them for a promotion 4 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source if you are unable to give an unbiased opinion then don t be afraid to be honest and tell them that you may not be the best person to give them advice alternatively help the person make their own decision by asking questions like are you happy here or do you think you can move forward with this company help them think through options instead of just telling someone what to do try to empower them to make their own choices ask them to brainstorm some options with you not only will this help you better understand the problem but it will give that person more ownership over their choices 5 x research source for example if they are struggling between two dresses ask them things like what dress do you feel most confident in or which dress is the most comfortable to wear compliment their judgment try not to sound bossy or like a know it all share your opinion but make it clear that you believe in their ability to make the final decision this will help the person feel more confident 6 x research source for example you can say i know you asked for my advice but i know that this is a decision you can handle offer support give your advice and follow it up with a supportive statement you don t want to pressure anyone into thinking they have to take your advice make sure they know that you support whatever choice they make 7 x research source say i feel like searching for a new job might be in your best interest but i m behind you no matter what you decide to do be sincere speak from the heart make it clear that you care about the person use words that are honest and kind for example this is a tough situation and i feel for you i think it s probably a good idea to put your dog down because he is in pain but i support you no matter what 8 x research source avoid judgement remember that whoever asked for your advice trusts you make sure that you don t damage this trust by judging them when you re planning what to say make sure that you use neutral objective language 9 x research source for example don t say of course you shouldn t leave your wife what are you stupid instead you could say this is a really personal decision my advice is that you take some time to examine both your priorities and your emotions give advice when asked a good rule of thumb is that you should not offer unsolicited advice if someone mentions a problem it s a pretty common instinct to jump in and offer some suggestions however that can make the person feel bad and could suggest that you don t have faith in their judgement 10 x research source if someone brings up a tough situation but doesn t ask for advice just say that s tough let me know if i can help in any way ask for permission to give advice sometimes you might feel compelled to offer advice even when no one has asked for it in this case you should still ask if it s okay to offer advice don t just jump in and tell someone what to do without asking if they want to hear it you don t want to add more stress to their life 11 x research source you can say i do have some experience dealing with this type of thing would you mind if i offered you some advice evaluate the request even if someone asks for your advice you shouldn t always give it if you know nothing about the situation or don t have much information you might consider saying nothing you can offer support in other ways 12 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source for example you could say i really don t have much investment experience but our friend bob is great with that you should ask him take into account how well you know this person before giving advice consider who you are giving it to is it a casual acquaintance if they ask for a recommendation for a good coffee shop go ahead and give your opinion if the issue is of a more personal nature think twice consider the consequences you don t want to damage your relationships do you have a coworker asking for advice tread carefully you don t want to risk a poor working relationship if your advice doesn t serve them well,Work-World

how to monitor your employees,effective managers and team leaders actively monitor their employees in a variety of ways to ensure that low performers are quickly disciplined and high performers are rewarded monitoring employees can also help you identify areas where employees are wasting company time or resources on private matters with the right software you can block websites that are inappropriate or not applicable to business operations successfully monitoring employees without causing unnecessary office friction should be goal of any effective manager,create a written explanation of your policies your policies will only be effective if they are explained in clear terms in an employee handbook or guide this guide should be easily accessible to all employees and define what your policies are and what will be done in the event that they are not followed for any monitoring policy you have like internet or phone monitoring you may want to also explain the thought process that led to your policies explaining why you are doing so may help to reduce employee mistrust caused by monitoring their activities 1 x research source set clear policies on timekeeping billable hours if applicable personal phone calls and personal internet use at work encourage employees to take off the clock breaks where appropriate make sure employees are aware of these policies if any type of monitoring is taking place beyond standard checking in on progress such as if you are using phone or internet monitoring you should inform your employees directly hold a meeting or send out a mass email to explain changes in monitoring policy and explain exactly when and how information will be recorded saved and deleted in some states like connecticut and delaware you are legally required to inform your employees of any internet monitoring even if you are not required to inform your employees about monitoring there may be backlash if you don t tell them and they find out on their own 2 x research source follow disciplinary guidelines exactly when an employee fails to follow your policies make sure that the stated disciplinary action for that infraction is taken make sure to apply policies equally to all employees be clear about your intentions document the disciplinary action and have the employee sign disciplinary plans if you fail to properly follow these guidelines employees will come to believe that your carefully set policies will not really be enforced keep your policies within reason don t check in too often or institute overly limiting internet policies a nosy boss can decrease morale and make employees feel nervous focus on results rather than on process if an employee is producing good work and works well in a team don t harp too much on the details 3 x research source give your upper level staff more freedom while it might be appropriate to give a temp or administrative assistant who has little investment in your business a computer that faces an open space you can monitor upper level staff will expect trust freedom to do work their own way will likely make upper level staff more productive not less check in on your employees from time to time check in with staff in their own office at an unscheduled time if a staff member is frequently clicking away from a window when you walk in or hanging up the phone you may need to express some concern watching employees in person can also help you offer constructive criticism for their work 4 x research source ask for an explanation of what an employee has been working on one simple way to keep employees accountable is to have regular conversations with them about how their work is going ask them what they have done since your last conversation asking more questions and evaluating their responses as the conversation develops ask for details and tangible evidence of results 5 x research source make employees document their own work have your employee record their work progress in activity logs checklists or progress reports however reports should not be overly burdensome or busywork but should encourage team members and management alike to keep in touch and on the same page don t be afraid to ask for proof of work described in a report when you speak with the employee 6 x research source assess works in progress if you re concerned about productivity ask for concrete proof of performance that is measurable and time bound if an employee is a project leader set milestones but also ask for plans and timelines for the project check in with other staff to make sure all members of the project team are communicating personally track the progress of longer term projects and assess their accuracy and completeness for example you could monitor data entries for an employee who is assigned to managing a database you could evaluate the timeliness of the entries their accuracy and their adherence to company guidelines 7 x research source ask others about employee interactions ask suppliers customers and other employees about their interactions with a given employee to get a picture of how that employee has been behaving however you need a way to increase the objectivity of these observation so that employees are not unfairly represented when asking for this information ask for details about the interaction instead of impressions ask for descriptions of the interactions instead of evaluations and always keep an open mind you never know when an employee is being misrepresented 8 x research source choose monitoring software monitoring software can be set up in a number of ways the first thing to consider is setting a complete system with a server this will include antivirus and malware protection and also employee monitoring if you don t have it staff to maintain the equipment you can use a cloud based service like trend micro business security or symantec cloud to get these services these services are not tremendously expensive expect to pay about 150 per year if you are just trying to track employee web usage and block some sites a simpler software package will do this service will be cheaper and allow you to monitor and filter web pages view keystrokes and capture screenshots for example interguard sonar provides these services in some cases you may even be able to get rudimentary tracking systems for free for example activtrak monitors system web traffic and produces a monthly report for you 9 x research source block harmful or inappropriate websites employers have the right to monitor what web pages their employees visit and to block websites that they deem unimportant to business operations inappropriate or potentially harmful mainly employers block certain websites to either make sure employees are productive like blocking facebook or stock trading sites that distract them or to ensure that employees are not harassing coworkers or committing corporate espionage employers may also block sites considered to be pornographic or hateful some monitoring packages allow for set time limits on certain types of websites for example allowing a set amount of time each day on social media sites 10 x research source when you notice that your employees are visiting a website unrelated to work frequently block that website and then send out an email reminding them that they are on company time 11 x research source monitor email monitoring emails is more difficult for employers to justify before reading any employee emails employees should be notified of the policy that allows their emails to be read in addition the employer usually needs a reason for the suspicion that led them to read the emails like a documented incident with that employee it is also difficult for employers to justify reading emails if they claimed originally that emails will be confidential 12 x research source make sure you are in compliance with the law certain monitoring measures may interfere with your employees right to privacy check with an employment lawyer before you install monitoring software make sure there is written documentation on the software that the employees have signed and that everyone understands what the software is for 13 x research source record phone conversations federal law allows employers to monitor employee phone conversations however this is only true for business related calls like those with customers or suppliers an employer is generally not permitted to monitor personal calls and must stop recording and monitoring the call when they realize it is personal the only exception to this is if personal phone calls are explicitly prohibited by workplace policy the recording and monitoring of voice mails should be done only with justification like a documented suspicion of misconduct 14 x research source phone conversations may be recorded using phone taps or an electronic recording system in some cases this can be tied in with your other monitoring software set up video surveillance businesses typically use video surveillance to discourage customers from stealing products however some businesses also use video surveillance to make sure that employees are being productive and not violating the business s policies monitoring employees this way can provide you with unbiased evidence of employee misconduct and can also motivate them to work more diligently however the constant feeling of being watched might make employees uncomfortable and lead to a decline in morale for these reasons carefully consider the pros and cons before using video surveillance in many states video surveillance is also carefully regulated by state law check with your state laws before implementing this type of monitoring videotaping employees doing certain activities like using the restroom or changing is always illegal and can result in criminal penalties 15 x research source track your employees locations certain apps like xora and tsheets allow employers to track employee movement through their smartphones this is typically used for clocking in or out and is legal if the employee gives consent however some employees are tracked 24 7 using the software which could give them legal grounds to sue their employers for breach of privacy if you implement this type of policy consult with a lawyer to make sure you are doing so legally shipping or driving based businesses may also use trackers in vehicles to ensure that drivers stay on route this is a common practice and is generally acceptable 16 x research

how to file alphabetically,alphabetic filing is a fundamental way to organize documents that allows you to quickly store access and manage your personal and business files by implementing alphabetical filing in your life you will ensure all documents are protected and readily available there are many rules on how to file alphabetically in english to preserve a sensible filing system luckily it s simple to get started with new documents and still is not a difficult change to make if you need to reorganize,decide on the alphabetical system you will use even something as seemingly straightforward as alphabetical filing offers several options to choose from 1 x research source it is important that you choose one system and use it consistently letter by letter filing considers each letter in each word in the order of appearance ignoring any spaces between words word by word filing orders items based on the first letter of each word in succession unit by unit filing takes into account each word abbreviation and initial ordering items according to these the unit by unit system is generally recommended group items once you have all of the items you need to file decide how you want to group the files you can choose the dictionary format in which all files are put in one alphabetical order regardless of the type of file or the items it contains you can also use the encyclopedia format in which items are grouped by type or subject and then each group is alphabetically arranged 2 x research source if you have lots of different types of items to file recipes tax receipts letters etc then it can be helpful to use the encyclopedia format group the items by type first then alphabetically order the items in each group keep the groups separated using dividers or color coding index your files indexing is the manner of placing each section of a title in the correct unit 3 x research source to index items before filing them you must break down the elements of each item s name and create a new alphabetized name which may differ from the standard name for example suppose you have the following items to index and file an article on aardvarks titled nocturnal feeding of aardvarks a biography of noted aardvark expert jane a doe and a promotional brochure for a detroit zoo aardvark exhibit the biography of jane a doe would be indexed as doe jane a since last names come first in filing it would be filed under the letter d the article nocturnal feeding of aardvarks could be indexed as is if you choose dictionary style grouping it could be filed under the letter n for nocturnal using this grouping alternatively you could index nocturnal feeding of aardvarks as aardvarks nocturnal feeding of this would make sense if you were using an encyclopedia style grouping and not just filing items related to aardvarks the item would then be filed under a the promotional brochure could be indexed as aardvarks exhibits detroit zoo this would make sense if you expect to have several materials on aardvark exhibits for example you might have another item to be indexed as aardvarks exhibits toledo zoo alternatively the promotional brochure could be indexed as detroit zoo aardvark exhibit this might make sense if you expect to have several items related to the detroit zoo or if you want to use an encyclopedia style grouping to file items by geographic location order files alphabetically according to their indexed name the general rule for filing alphabetically is to arrange items in order from a first to z last use increasingly specific information to distinguish between and order separate items 4 x research source for instance the order of your indexed files in the previous step could then be depending on the system you use doe jane a detroit zoo aardvark exhibit and nocturnal feeding of aardvarks or aardvarks exhibits detroit zoo aardvarks nocturnal feeding of and doe jane a a file for wallaby would come after a file for emu a file for kangaroo would come in between and a file for aardvark would come before one for bear and one for emu this would give you the following file order aardvark bear emu kangaroo wallaby if you then added a file for anteater it would come after any files for aardvark since both begin with the letter a you have to look at the second letter of each word n and a respectively to determine the order and then arrange files based on this the new order would be aardvark anteater bear emu kangaroo wallaby label your file folders to make it easy to locate items label each file folder with the proper indexed name of the item s it contains this will also make it easier to introduce new files in the proper order place items in the folder designated for them you may also find it useful to color code your files to improve usability for instance if you are using an encyclopedia style grouping give each group a separate color and label each item file in each group with its respective color document the indexing and filing system be consistent with your indexing and filing system whatever it is ensure anyone with access to the files is aware of the system for instance you can create and share a document that details your filing system rules this will help everyone be able to use the filing system efficiently 5 x research source file new items properly place files in the cabinet based on the indexed names and alphabetical order according to the system you use shift the current files as needed to place new files in the correct place file items under their significant term sometimes it makes sense to file items based on key words regardless of the order that words in a title or name appear this ensures that a file can be indexed and located using the most logical term for instance first bank of chicago could be indexed and filed as chicago first bank of chicago is the key term in this entry rather than first or bank especially if you might have other items with similar names such as first bank of tulsa or chicago bank and trust order names by surname typical filing standards recommend indexing individuals by last name first since the surname is considered the significant term thus jane a doe would be indexed and filed as doe jane a put titles dr mrs major etc at the end 6 x research source dr jane a doe for instance would be indexed and filed as doe jane a dr generally order names as they are spelled letter by letter for instance macdonald would come before mcdonald likewise d l le de etc are considered as part of name not separate units 7 x research source for instance order files heinlein le guin l engle and wolfe in that order and not as l engle le guin heinlein wolfe a common exception to these rules about names is when an individual s name forms part of a business or organization name in these cases treat the individual s name as units within the business name for instance jane a doe pest control would be filed under j and not indexed as doe jane a pest control ignore articles conjunctions and prepositions articles such as a an and the conjunctions such as and but and or and prepositions such as for of and in are generally skipped when indexing and filing alphabetically since they are not considered significant terms this is the case even when they form the beginning of an item s name for instance an investigation of emu feeding practices would be in filed under e for emu the significant word in this item s title rather than a for an doe and smith pest control would be filed after doe jane a both indexed names begin with the word doe so you move on to the next significant term in each smith and jane respectively to determine the file order ignore the word and since it is not significant treat abbreviations as though they were spelled out 8 x research source when indexing and filing items you may encounter abbreviations such as mfg for manufacturing or inc for incorporated generally you should index and file items as though these abbreviations were spelled out rather than simply as strings of letters for instance jane a doe mining company would be filed after jane a doe mfg file numerals ordinarily while filing items alphabetically you may encounter numerals within their titles generally file numbers ordinarily rather than as if they were spelled out numbers are also filed before letters for instance 3m company would be filed before 100 great business ideas since 3 comes before 100 great business ideas and great business leaders would be filed after 100 great business ideas since numbers are arranged before letters numbers that are already spelled out are treated as words rather than numerals for instance file items 100 great business leaders great business ideas and two hundred great business ideas in that order if it serves your filing purposes however you can make an exception and always file numerals as though they were spelled out deal with any special characters any non alphabetical or non numeric characters that you encounter when indexing and filing items must be taken into account what to do with these characters however depends on their type punctuation such as apostrophes periods and commas is generally ignored when indexing and filing items 9 x research source for instance file washington s best coffee and washington state fair in that order diacritics are treated as the corresponding letter without the diacritic mark 10 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source for example file éclair as eclair and über as uber the exception to this is when you are filing according to the alphabet of a language that uses diacritics in which case you should follow the normal alphabetical order of that language use the general rule nothing before something when necessary generally spaces including punctuation and other elements that are skipped are ignored when filing alphabetically however in cases where you have items that begin the same way use a space or the rule nothing before something to determine the filing order for instance file north east bank north east manufacturing and northeast bank in that order likewise doe jane a would be filed before doe jane a dr distinguish files by more detailed information when necessary 11 x research source in rarer cases alphabetic information is not enough to determine the order of files in these cases you must utilize further information to index and order items mark this additional information on the respective files to help you distinguish them for instance if you had items for two different individuals named jane a doe you could order them by birthdate file doe jane a b 1853 would thus come before file doe jane a b 1967 you could also order items according to geography when you need to make distinctions if you have files for three different banks in three different locations and each bank is called first united bank and trust you could order them alphabetically in the order first united bank and trust georgia first united bank and trust oklahoma and first united bank and trust south dakota likewise if you had items for two different bears or types of bears you would distinguish them further based on species geographic location etc for instance you might have files on bear brown and bear grizzly in that order or files on bears european and bears north american in that order publicize exceptions and special rules 12 x research source make sure that everyone who uses your files knows about any exceptions to standard guidelines that are factored into your filing system this will help ensure that everyone can use the filing system properly and efficiently,Work-World

how to adjust an office chair,if you regularly work at a desk for computer work or study you ll need to sit on an office chair that is correctly adjusted for your body to avoid back pain and problems as doctors chiropractors and physiotherapists know many people develop seriously overstretched ligaments in their spine and sometimes even disc problems due to sitting on unfitted office chairs for long periods of time however adjusting an office chair is simple and only takes a matter of minutes if you know how to adapt it to your body s proportions,establish the height of your workstation set up your workstation at the appropriate height the most desirable situation is if you can change the height of your workstation but few workstations allow for this if your workstation cannot be adjusted then you will have to adjust the height of your chair if your workstation can be adjusted then stand in front of the chair and adjust the height so that the highest point is just below the kneecap then adjust your workstation height so that your elbows form a 90 degree angle when you are sitting with your hands resting on the desk top 1 x research source assess the angle of your elbows with regard to the workstation sit as close to your desk as is comfortable with your upper arms parallel to your spine let your hands rest on the surface of the workstation or your computer keyboard whichever you will use more often they should be at a 90 degree angle 2 x research source sit on the chair in front of your workstation as closely as possible and feel under the seat of the chair for the height control this is usually located on the left side 3 x research source if your hands are higher than your elbows then the seat is too low raise your body off the seat and press the lever this will allow the seat to rise once it s reached the desired height let go of the lever to lock it into place if the seat is too high remain seated press the lever and let go when the desired height is reached make sure your feet are placed at the right level compared to your seat while sitting down with your feet flat on the ground slide your fingers between your thigh and the edge of the office chair there should be about a finger s width of space between your thigh and the office chair 4 x research source if you re very tall and there s more than a finger s width between the chair and your thigh you ll need to raise your office chair as well as your workstation to achieve the appropriate height if it s difficult to slide your fingers under your thigh you ll need to raise your feet to attain a 90 degree angle at your knees you can use an adjustable footrest to create a higher surface for your feet to rest on measure the distance between your calf and the front of your office chair clench your fist and try to pass it between your office chair and the back of your calf there should be a fist sized space about 5 cm or 2 inches between your calf and the edge of the chair this determines whether the depth of the chair is correct 5 x research source if it s tight and difficult to fit your fist in the space your chair is too deep and you ll need to bring the backrest forward most ergonomic office chairs allow you to do so by turning a lever below the seat on the right hand side if you can t adjust the chair s depth use a low back or lumbar support if there is too much space between your calves and the edge of the chair then you can adjust the back backwards there will usually be a lever below the seat on the right hand side it s essential that the depth of your office chair is correct to avoid slumping or slouching while you work good lower back support will minimize the strain on your back and is a great precaution against low back injuries adjust the height of the backrest while sitting properly on the chair with your feet down and your calves a fist space away from the edge of the chair move the backrest up or down to fit in the small of your back this way it will provide the greatest support for your back you want to feel firm support over the lumbar curve of your lower back there should be a knob on the back of the chair allowing the backrest to move up and down since it is easier to lower the backrest than to raise it while sitting start by raising it all the way up while standing then sit in the chair and adjust the backrest down until it fits in the small of your back not all chairs will allow you to adjust the height of the backrest adjust the angle of the backrest to fit your back the backrest should be at an angle that supports you while sitting in your preferred posture you should not have to lean back to feel it nor lean farther forward that you like to sit 6 x research source there will be a knob locking the backrest angle in place on the back of the chair unlock the backrest angle and lean forwards and backwards while looking at your monitor once you reach the angle that feels right lock the backrest into place not all chairs will allow you to adjust the angle of the backrest adjust the armrests of the chair so that they barely touch your elbows when they are at a 90 degree angle the armrests should just barely touch your elbows when resting your hands on the desk top or computer keyboard if they are too high then they will force you to position your arms awkwardly your arms should be able to swing freely 7 x research source resting your arms on the armrests while typing will inhibit normal arm movement and cause extra strain on your fingers and supporting structures some chairs will require a screwdriver to adjust the armrests while others will have a knob that can be used to adjust the height of the armrests check on the lower portion of your armrests adjustable armrests are not available on all chairs if your armrests are too high and cannot be adjusted then you should remove the armrests from the chair to prevent them from causing pain to your shoulders and fingers 8 x research source assess your resting eye level your eyes should be level with the computer screen that you are working on assess this by sitting on the chair closing your eyes pointing your head directly forward and slowly opening them you should be looking at the center of the computer screen and be able to read everything on it without straining your neck or moving your eyes up or down 9 x research source if you have to move your eyes down to reach the computer screen then you can place something underneath it to raise its level for example you could slide a box under a monitor to raise it to the proper height if you have to move your eyes up to reach the computer screen then you should try to find a way to lower the screen so that it is directly ahead of you 10 x research source choose the chair made for your body size most chairs are made to fit around 90 percent of people but those on the ends of the spectrum may not fit since there is no average person chairs are made in sizes that can be fully adjustable so that they can be made to fit most people however if you are very tall or very short then you may need a custom made chair unless you get a custom made chair you should get a fully adjustable chair so that you can adjust it properly for your body 11 x research source choose a chair with controls that can be easily operated while sitting choosing a chair with controls that are easy to operate while sitting will allow you to adjust your chair completely to your body you can put yourself in the chair and then adjust all the pieces directly onto your body 12 x research source choose a chair with a seat that can be adjusted for height and tilt height is a very important factor when adjusting a chair so it is very important that the height of the chair can be adjusted according to your body and needs tilt is also important for allowing correct posture while sitting 13 x research source choose a comfortable seat that curves towards the floor at the front edge the curve along the edge will provide more space for your knees and comfort on the backs of your thighs additionally the seat should not put pressure on the back of thighs or knees 14 x research source choose a chair with breathable non slippery fabric you don t want to get all sweaty while working at your desk nor do you want to slide around too much so these factors are important when choosing a chair 15 x research source choose a chair with a backrest that is shaped to support the lower back and adjustable in height and angle adjusting the backrest to completely support your lower back will allow your to remain pain and injury free 16 x research source choose a chair with a stable five point base the base should be a five point system that provides balance and stability while sitting on the chair the base should be on casters or wheels depending on your preferences 17 x research source choose a chair with armrests that are the right distance apart you should be able to easily get in and out of the chair but the armrests should be as close as possible while sitting the closer your elbows stay to your body while sitting the more comfortable you will be 18 x research source choose a chair with adjustable armrests armrests should never hamper your movement while working or typing adjustable armrests will allow you to customize their height for your body size and

how to look busy at work without really working,you work hard most of the time but every once in awhile you need to look busy when you re actually slacking off this is especially necessary when you get your workload done quickly and have some extra time to kill you don t want your boss to see you watching netflix or staring into space learn how to slack off at your desk and how to look busy when you leave your desk for a while,arrange your desk so no one can see your computer screen if you work in an office or cubicle of some kind you don t want someone to walk up behind you without you knowing it arrange your computer so you are facing the entrance to your area if you have non work windows open you can quickly close them without them being seen 1 x research source in many cubicle style settings your desk will be set up in a fixed position at the very least turn your screen away from the entrance and angle your chair toward the entrance scatter work materials around your desk peel off four or five sticky notes and write messages on them even peel off a few and leave them blank at different spots on your desk in case you need one in a hurry set out binders and open them to project pages leave a few documents that look like what you should be doing don t bring things from home that don t look like work use old projects or make some decoy documents that look like what you d be working on there may be a fine line between a messy work in progress desk and a desk that is just a mess keep things in check so it doesn t get too out of hand learn to quickly switch between tabs and windows keyboard shortcuts allow you to toggle between windows and tabs use this trick to switch from watching internet videos to checking over the latest customer data practice the shortcut so you can tap it quickly without thinking 2 x research source use alt tab on pcs to switch from one window to another window on macs use command tab to switch between open applications use ctrl tab on pcs to switch between tabs within the same window on macs use control tab to switch between tabs in the same window for example if you have a mac laptop open itunes two different tabs on safari and garageband hold command and press tab to switch from itunes to safari then hold control and press tab to switch from one safari tab to the other safari tab open decoy tabs that look like your work if you are an accountant always have a couple of spreadsheets open if you do graphic design have a couple sketches that you re working on open these tabs first thing in the morning or set them to open automatically when you open a browser never close all of your tabs so just your desktop is showing an essentially blank screen will be a dead giveaway that you are not doing anything email word google docs business websites news sites are all good to keep open depending on what type of work you do scribble or type furiously the key to looking like you are busy is to always be doing something if you appear to be sitting completely still it s going to be obvious you aren t working anytime you get bored or have a lull in your work grab a notebook and start writing something or peck quickly on your keyboard 3 x research source it doesn t matter what you are typing or writing if you seem to be paying close attention to it you ll look busy this works better if you have a document on hand that is work related if you are asked show the decoy document as proof of what you re doing sit up straight and look at your work slacking off without being noticed has a lot to do with how you look if you are slouching in your chair leaning against something or staring off into space you ll look lazy good posture and keeping your eyes on something that looks like work will do a lot for your image 4 x research source if you stand while you work don t be caught sitting down or leaning up against something if you re going to zone out make sure you have some work out in front of you and keep your head pointed toward the work stuff use your cell phone to call your desk phone being on the phone if it s part of your job is a great way to look busy if the phone is slow sometimes dial your desk phone from your cell and then answer the desk phone depending on how good you are at acting it s easy to kill 10 15 minutes a few times a day on fake phone calls 5 x research source you ll probably want to have a plan for what the fake phone call is supposed to be about if you seem to be rambling or not making sense it will be obvious you are faking it if you want to really put some effort into it write up a script for a standard conversation you d have at work write dialogue for two people but make sure you only read the part that makes sense for you to say disable the sleep mode on your computer screen to save power many computers go into sleep mode after a certain time of inactivity if you leave the desk for long enough that your screen saver comes on it s a giveaway that you ve been gone awhile turn the sleep mode off so that the screen always looks like you just left 6 x research source make sure to leave a few windows open so it appears that you were working on something right before you left your desk never leave anything like a shopping site or a game open on your computer when you leave another option if you work on the computer is to leave something open that says loading or installing because this gives you a good reason to leave your desk leave your work area looking like you re in the middle of something fill your work area with several projects that you are

and developmental needs you also need to have a clear set of expectations and goals,have faith in yourself one of the worst things you can do as a supervisor is to doubt your own abilities if you re new to supervising others recognize that you will probably make some mistakes along the way but that does not mean you are not a good leader cut yourself a little slack but then commit yourself to doing the best you can 1 x research source keep in mind that you were hired to be a supervisor because your boss believes that you are capable of doing the job now you just have to prove your boss right don t let yourself believe that bosses never make mistakes nobody expects you to be perfect except yourself lead by example it s important to give your employees a good example of model behavior

of different employees some employees may flourish under hands on management while others may benefit from more freedom it is your responsibility to recognize these needs and react accordingly this

consistent in your expectations and disciplinary measures be accountable as the supervisor you are responsible for your whole team if you miss a deadline or lose a client don t point fingers and blame

messages you want to convey and communicate them face to face or over the phone put thought into your email communications to ensure that they are clear concise and respectful regular meetings with employees will give you the opportunity to ask them about the projects they are working on hear worker grievances and triumphs discuss team successes and brainstorm solutions to new problems always be

responsibilities and you will be giving your employees the opportunity to flourish 13 x research source remember that you are still ultimately responsible for your employees work even if you delegate

transform their weaknesses into competencies the first step is creating awareness of an area that needs improvement don t wait for your employee s next yearly review if you can offer some constructive criticism today confront conflict supervisors have to deal with a lot of uncomfortable situations from disputes between employees to layoffs while it may be tempting to avoid dealing with these

having a difficult conversation with an employee always focus on objective observations and avoid making accusations 18 x research source don t procrastinate procrastination is bad when employees do it but it s even worse when supervisors do it as a leader you need to make a plan for tackling a project as soon as possible 19 x research source find solutions instead of wasting your time complaining about the problems your organization or your department is facing use that time to come up with a game plan 20 x research source keep in mind that long term solutions are always better than short term solutions even if they are harder to implement 21 x research source being an effective problem solver means staying focused on the facts of the situation and thinking of creative solutions avoid focusing on emotions and blame think of the necessary steps for helping employees to regain composure and resume the task at hand challenge yourself good leaders should always be looking for new ways to challenge themselves and their teams 22 x research source this doesn t mean overwhelming your team or taking on more than you can handle but it does mean stepping outside of your comfort zone every once in a while encourage employees to do the same by offering them the opportunity to work on projects that are unfamiliar to them set goals it s important that a leader have

help keep them on track and motivated 23 x research source be sure to listen to your team if they tell you the goals are not attainable there s no reason a goal can t be modified the better your sense is of how much your team has to accomplish in a certain amount of time the better you will understand how much additional work they are actually able to take on be supportive the supervisor needs to be able to step in and help the team problem solve whenever necessary make sure your team knows that if they are ever having a problem with a project you are available to help them figure it out 24 x research source the importance of feedback cannot be overstated make sure you let your employees know how they are doing whether good or bad streamline processes create systems to save employees time on a task and or to eliminate errors create documents that outline employee responsibilities and who is responsible for which tasks automate menial tasks whenever possible encouraging employees to focus more on productive and engaging projects be resilient not everything will go according to plan and as a supervisor you need to be okay with that try not to take failures too personally instead learn from them and apply that knowledge to your next project so you can avoid the same mistakes keep in mind that negative energy will trickle down to your entire team so be sure to set the right

clarification about this part of my job can you give me more information about why there has been a delay on this or i put in a lot of time on that project and was proud of my work i understand some

when your boss responds do your best to truly listen don t interrupt them to defend yourself or argue about something listen respectfully and hear that they re saying 13 x research source hopefully your boss responds positively and appreciates that you opened a channel for more genuine conversation if you need to answer any questions or ask other ones you may have let the situation go and move

record of you expressing concern and disappointment about something that happened at your job if you do write an email make sure to be clear calm and direct 15 x research source remember that your boss won t be able to read your body language or tone like they would if you were meeting in person for example an email about disappointment in getting passed over for a recent job might look

how to increase linkedin engagement,whether you use linkedin strictly for your personal brand or you manage a business profile on linkedin it can be tricky to get the levels of engagement you want on the platform part of the reason for this is that linkedin is not considered as fun as other social media platforms like facebook and instagram however there are many things you can do to increase engagement with your posts and profile on linkedin to get more out of it and gain publicity and even potential clients for yourself or your company don t get discouraged if you aren t seeing massive engagement right away keep tweaking your profile and creating high quality content and watch your following and engagement grow,highlight your expertise and knowledge with your profile s headline decide what topic or field you mainly want to share content in and gain followers make the headline on your profile specific to this rather than more general appealing to a smaller group of people interested in something specific will get you more engagement than trying to appeal to a large diverse audience 1 x research source for example if you plan to share content about data analysis and want to gain followers who will engage with your posts on this topic your headline could be something like data analyst i use real world data to develop businesses you can also try writing a headline that speaks directly to your audience if you want to offer them something specific for example if you plan to share content about leadership you could write something like leadership coach i help professionals grow their leadership skills update your profile every month or quarter go through your profile at the end of every month or quarter and add any new work experience achievements skills certifications and anything else that will make you look like more of an expert in your field set a recurring reminder on your phone to update your profile if it helps you remember to do this 2 x research source updating your profile regularly makes you look more active on linkedin and people are more likely to follow you and engage with you make sure to update your profile any time you change something like your current position or location as well use high quality profile and background photos set your personal profile photo to a professional looking headshot change the default linkedin background photo to something that showcases your location your industry or your personal brand 3 x research source it s ok if you don t want to invest in getting a professional headshot taken by a photographer there are other ways to take a good profile picture for example you can take a professional looking profile photo by standing against a blank wall and using a smartphone camera s portrait setting some ideas for your background photo could be an aerial photo of the city you live and work in a custom logo for your personal brand or the logo of the company you work at include relevant keywords throughout your profile choose some keywords that are relevant to the types of jobs and clients you want and include them in your profile s headline and job descriptions this will help people who are more likely to engage with you find you through linkedin search 4 x research source for example if you re a freelance content writer with a marketing focus you can use keywords like content creator content writer ghost writer and content marketer take notes on your competitors linkedin profiles review the profiles of your top competitors and look at how they re portraying their brand to your potential customers take notes on their pictures descriptions listed specialties content updates and anything else that stands out on their profile 5 x research source if there are certain things you like about a competitor s profile you can try to include similar things on your profile in a unique way on the other hand if you want to differentiate yourself completely from a competitor you can avoid using things like similar descriptions or photos use custom branded banners to make your business profile look professional linkedin allows businesses to use up to 3 custom banners on their profiles so take advantage of all 3 of these slots create a unique branded banner for each one to make your profile look professional and polished 6 x research source you can also take advantage of the banner spaces to include a call to action for example if you re launching a new clothing line you could create a banner that includes some text that says something like our summer 2020 line is now available visit our website to see it now fill your profile with industry and product keywords to optimize it for search make sure to fill out your profile with all the relevant products and services that your company offers so people who search linkedin with those keywords are more likely to find your page include other relevant keywords that describe your company and aren t necessarily a product or service as well 7 x research source for example if your company manufactures and sells environmentally friendly clothing you could include keywords like eco friendly clothing eco friendly fashion environmentally friendly clothing environmentally conscious fashion and other terms along those lines that people might search for on linkedin ask customers for recommendations and endorsements reach out to past customers and ask them to write recommendations or to endorse your company on linkedin this will make your profile look more reliable and potential customers are more likely to engage with it 8 x research source for example if you sell environmentally friendly clothing you could send a follow up email to customers who have made online purchases from you and say something like we hope you re enjoying your new clothes if so would you mind taking a second to review and endorse us on linkedin this would help us get our eco friendly clothing to more customers worldwide create showcase pages to highlight specific products or services linkedin s showcase pages are additional pages that appear on the right hand side of your business profile and show up separately in linkedin search results create these pages for different product lines services or departments of your company to provide more focused and specific information for people interested in those things 9 x research source for example if you have an eco friendly clothing company you could make different showcase pages for women s clothing men s clothing shoes and any other lines you want to highlight that way if someone searches for something like eco friendly men s fashion they will see your showcase page and be taken directly to the page that is most relevant to them focus on publishing mainly text based content plain text posts actually tend to receive the highest numbers of likes comments and views on linkedin posts with external links and photos receive lower levels of engagement so focus your content publishing efforts on text 10 x research source this doesn t mean that you can t create other types of content in fact you definitely should add some variety it just means that text based content should be your first choice on linkedin for longer text based content you can use linkedin s write an article feature this allows you to publish more long form content directly on linkedin which is shown to get more engagement than trying to send traffic somewhere else such as a personal blog publish short native videos on linkedin to connect with your audience visually videos uploaded directly to linkedin tend to perform better than sharing videos from another platform like youtube or vimeo upload videos that are under 90 seconds to get the most engagement 11 x research source for example if you work in marketing you could start a video series of 30 second marketing tip videos or you could do 1 minute video interviews of other professionals in the marketing space another video idea is videos that demonstrate new technologies your company is working on for instance if you work in 3d printing you could upload videos of your latest 3d printers printing impressive objects tell personal or business stories in your content to connect with people readers and viewers are more likely to engage with content that tells a story share things like before and after stories and personal or client success stories 12 x research source for example if you re a career coach you could share a personal story about how you were once lost and struggling to find a career but you persisted and never gave up and now you re successful this will encourage engagement from users who are in a similar position if you work at a marketing agency you could tell a story about how your marketing services helped a certain struggling client boost their sales dramatically and become successful include a call to action at the end of every post ask users to comment and share your content telling users directly what you want them to do is an easy way to increase engagement 13 x research source for example you can say something like if you liked this video and found it helpful be sure to share it or let me know what you think about this topic in the comments below ask questions in your posts to facilitate conversation and debate end text based or video content by asking your readers and viewers what they think about the topic this will encourage people to leave comments and engage with you and other users on your content 14 x research source for example if you wrote a short post about 5 marketing trends for 2021 you can end it with a question like which of these trends do you think will be the most important and why if you re a fitness coach and you uploaded a video about a healthy diet you could end the video by saying something like which meal of the day is hardest for you to eat healthy at respond to users who engage with your content read the comments that people leave and try to respond to as many as possible every one if you have the time to keep the engagement growing when people see that you ve engaged with others on your past content they are more likely to take the time to leave a comment themselves 15 x research source if a piece of content you posted isn t getting the engagement you would like to see you can also try commenting on it to spark engagement for example you can ask for feedback or ask another question in the comments section even if someone leaves a simple comment like great points take the time to respond you can say something like i m glad you found this post useful thanks for reading post new content at least 1 2 times a week linkedin s algorithm rewards people who post regularly so make a habit of creating content at least once or twice a week to show up more in users feeds choose specific days of the week and set aside time on those days to share content on linkedin if it s easier for you to commit to doing it this way 16 x research source don t worry if you don t see high engagement right away just stick with it and keep publishing content regularly eventually it will pay off in the form of more followers connections and engagement use up to 6 hashtags in each post to increase the visibility of your posts linkedin allows users to search for content with hashtags so use a few of them in every post you make to help your content appear to a wider audience choose hashtags that are highly relevant to the specific content and your industry or professional niche 17 x research source for example if you posted something about marketing trends you can use hashtags like marketingtrends marketingtips and marketingindustry a person can also choose to follow certain hashtags on linkedin and content with those hashtags shows up at the top of their feed so if someone is following 3dprinting your posts that use that hashtag are more likely to appear to them invest in linkedin ads if you have the budget for it sponsor content that you want to have the most visibility so it shows up to more people create personalized ads that will go directly to users inboxes if you want to reach a very specific audience who is more likely to engage with your content 18 x research source for instance you can target your ads at people in certain industries or with specific job titles or functions share your content in relevant linkedin groups join some groups that are related to your area of expertise and the type of content you are posting on linkedin share your content within these groups to get it in front of highly interested users who are more likely to engage with it and share it themselves 19 x research source for example if you re primarily creating content related to software development you can look for groups of programming coding and software professionals before you start sharing in a group take a look at other content that has been posted to see if people are actually engaging in conversation in the group if not it might not be worth your time to post in the group you can join up to 100 groups on linkedin so try to find as many relevant groups as you can you could even try creating your own group to gain a following of people who are interested in the exact type of content you re creating engage with content that other people create when you comment on or like someone else s content it shows up in your connections feeds so you gain more visibility on linkedin people will then potentially jump into the conversation or click on your profile and go look at the content that you ve created 20 x research source try to find other people who are in the same industry or professional niche and engage with their content that way people who are interested in their content might take a look at what you ve created and engage with it as well,Work-World

skills they ve developed often shine during a challenge combat rumors with facts and frequent 2 way communication expect new rumors to crop up regularly throughout the change process work to stay a step ahead of fear inducing rumors by maintaining the clear and frequent communication plan you established at the start of the change process 13 x research source confront rumors directly but in most cases without calling anyone out in particular i ve heard rumblings that some of you are worried that phase 2 of the restructuring is just a cover for massive job cuts so let me clarify a few things that i ve been telling you right from the start of this process and then i ll open the floor to questions don t pretend you have all the answers they re seeking be honest with your workers throughout

how to prevent synthetic identity theft,synthetic identity theft puts a new twist on regular identity theft while this form of fraud still relies on stealing valid social security numbers the fraudster creates a new name and birthdate to associate with that number creating a fake synthetic identity synthetic identity theft is a long game because the thief must build a positive credit history for the new identity the social security numbers of children are the most vulnerable to synthetic identity because children don t have an established credit history however anyone is potentially at risk securing your own data and the data of your children is the best way to ensure you don t become the next victim of synthetic identity theft 1 x research source,create complex passwords for your online accounts choose a password that would be difficult for anyone to guess passwords that use a combination of letters numbers and special characters tend to be the most secure if the account is case sensitive include upper and lower case letters as well 2 x research source most computers and electronic devices are equipped with a password manager feature that will come up with strong passwords for you this takes some of the pressure off of you to constantly come up with a unique password for every online account and you should have a unique password for every account you have password managers also store your passwords in an encrypted file however if you use a password manager keep in mind that anyone who has access to your computer or device potentially has access to all of your passwords as well set a strong password and use thumbprint or face recognition to keep your computer or other device locked when you re not using it keep your computer network and devices up to date hackers often exploit weaknesses in computer operating systems to access computers and other electronic devices and steal data programmers work quickly to correct these problems so the operating system remains secure however if you don t update your system in a timely fashion your data remains vulnerable 3 x trustworthy source usa gov official website for the united states federal government go to source set up automatic updates if you don t want to worry about it usually you can schedule automatic updates to occur at a time when you aren t using your computer or device such as 2 00 a m so it won t interrupt any work you might be doing if you don t want to set up automatic updates make it a habit to check for updates before you start using your computer or other devices each day transmit personal data only when on a private secured network if a hacker can get onto a computer or wi fi network they will likely be able to get into your computer or other devices as well if you need to access financial accounts or send sensitive information wait until you re on a secure private network to do so 4 x trustworthy source usa gov official website for the united states federal government go to source make sure any website where you enter personal data is secure as well look for a lock in the browser window next to the url a secure url also starts with https

information about you simply by stealing your mail if you don t have a lock on your mailbox make sure you get it every day 6 x research source if you do have a locked mailbox make sure the lock is in working order and your mailbox key is secure if the lock is broken replace it if you re a renter talk to your landlord shred documents with personal data on them before throwing them out identity thieves are not above going through the trash invest in a small shredder you can order one online and they typically aren t very expensive and shred any documents that have identifying information on them 7 x research source for added security soak the shreds in water before throwing them out you can also call a document security company to shred and dispose of your documents for you although this is an unnecessary expense for most individuals confirm the identity of callers or email senders for an identity thief sometimes it s as easy as calling you and pretending to be an employee of your bank or credit card company they ask you to verify your information which in turn gives them the information they need to steal your identity refuse to give personal information to anyone who calls you if you haven t somehow confirmed their identity 8 x research source one of the easiest ways to confirm that a call or email actually came from a company is to call the company yourself use the information you have not any information that might have been given to you by the caller or included in the email for example call the customer service number on the back of your credit card and ask if they ve been trying to get in touch with you about your account limit the documents you carry with you assume that any document you carry with you can be taken or accessed and copied by someone else don t carry identification that you don t need for a specific purpose and only carry the bank cards you re planning on using 9 x research source for example it is very rare that you would need to carry your social security card around with you typically this can be left at home in a safe place likewise if you re not traveling out of the country you shouldn t need to carry your passport with you avoid oversharing on social media an identity thief can learn a lot about you by going through your social media pages generally limit posts shared to people you know if you do share public posts make sure they don t include any names or other personally identifying information 10 x research source for example you want to be cautious about sharing your birthday or how old you are an identity thief who already has your social security number and address can look online for your birthdate and will often find it be careful with comments on friends posts as well even if you know them you don t know everyone they know and don t know how they have privacy set on their page review your credit report at least once a year you re entitled to 1 free credit report each year from each of the 3 major credit bureaus equifax experian and transunion go to http www annualcreditreport com to order your free reports 11 x trustworthy source usa gov official website for the united states federal

credit on a regular basis you ll discover signs of identity theft much more quickly avoid sharing your child s information if not necessary at school or at the doctor sharing your child s personal information is often unavoidable however if you re signing your child up for something leave out personal information until you find out why it s needed often it isn t needed at all 12 x research source for example if you re signing your child up for a recreational soccer league the application might ask for the child s social security number however there s likely no reason the league needs this information when signing your kids up to play online games or participate in other online activities consider not using their last name or giving them a pseudonym your child might even enjoy coming up with a fun name to use read privacy policies carefully before providing your child s information schools doctors and other organizations may need your child s personal information before you release that information ask for a copy of the organization s privacy policy make sure you understand how your child s data is collected used stored and discarded 13 x research source if you don t understand some aspect of the privacy policy ask if the person you ask doesn t know they can point you to someone who does don t release your child s information until you re comfortable that the information is being adequately secured use your own information instead of your child s whenever possible if you re signing your child up for a rewards program or online game you can usually use your own information instead of your child s if possible let them help create the username or screen name 14 x research source for example if your child wants to join the rewards club at your local game store set up the account in your name rather than your child s name then you can give your child the card so they can redeem the rewards they earn using your own information and setting the password also gives you the ability to monitor your child s activity on the site or with the program because they can t log on unless you re there keep important documents in a safe or lockbox secure documents such as birth certificates passports and social security cards in your home unless you re using them if you need these documents to establish your child s identity carry them yourself and put them back under lock and key when you return home never give them to your child to manage no matter how mature and responsible your child is 15 x research source don t leave copies lying around either for example if you copy your child s social security number onto a piece of scratch paper to enter on a form destroy the piece of scratch paper as soon as you re done with it freeze credit reports of children under 16 freezing your child s credit provides the ultimate protection against synthetic identity theft because any fraudster who gets your child s social security number won t be able to do anything with it you ll have to freeze their credit at each of the 3 major credit bureaus equifax experian and transunion individually each credit bureau has a form you can use available on its website make 3 copies of each of the following documents to submit to each of the credit bureaus to verify you and your child s identity 16 x research source your government issued photo id your birth certificate your child s birth certificate or other document showing that you have legal guardianship of the child your social security card your child s social security card a utility bill bank or insurance statement with your name and address on it get your child s credit report on their 16th birthday once your child turns 16 a credit report will be automatically created for them if you haven t already created a credit report for your child to freeze it you can get a free copy from each of the 3 major credit bureaus 17 x research source because your child likely won t have an automatically generated credit report yet you usually have to contact each of the 3 credit bureaus individually to request the report the toll free numbers are equifax 866 640 2273experian 888 397 3742transunion 833 395 6938 dispute credit report entries you don t recognize when you access your credit report check each entry against your own records if you don t have any record of a debt or open account referenced on your report contact both the credit bureau and the company that reported the information and dispute it make your dispute in writing and keep copies of all communication you have regarding the dispute 18 x trustworthy source state of massachusetts official website for the state of massachusetts go to source contact information for the company that reported the information will be included on your credit report sometimes contacting the company directly will get faster results since the credit bureau has to contact the reporting company anyway each of the 3 major credit bureaus allows you to dispute items on your credit report directly from their website however you still want to make sure you re printing or saving digital copies of all communications evaluate government notices or denials of benefits if you re denied benefits or get a notice from the government that the social security number you provided is already in use this is often a sign that you or your child is the victim of synthetic identity theft fraudsters also use social security numbers to apply for government benefits or even file taxes in hopes of getting a refund 19 x trustworthy source national conference of state legislatures bipartisan nongovernment organization serving the members of state legislatures and their constituents go to source for example an identity thief with your child s social security number could create a synthetic identity to attach to that number then claim the child as a dependent on their taxes making them eligible for the dependent child credit if you get a notice from the irs or from social security read it carefully and follow the instructions look for pre approved credit offers in a child s name since children typically don t have bank accounts or credit cards and can t sign for a loan you wouldn t expect them to get pre approved credit offers if they happen to get one it could be a sign that someone else is using your child s social security number for fraudulent purposes 20 x research source since the thief is using your child s actual name rather than an invented name this is normal identity theft not synthetic identity theft however it s still something you should take action on before it s too late monitor accounts for errors or unusual activity check your banking and credit card statements every month and compare them to your own records if you see any unusual transactions or other activity report them immediately 21 x research source for example an identity thief might change your address on your account so that your bill is sent to them instead of to you they might then request a credit increase or even have a new card sent to them with the old card canceled then they can rack up charges on your account without you knowing it contact the company if you don t receive a bill you should have most companies send out their bills at around the same time every month if you haven t received a bill and it s more than a week after you normally get it your bill may have been stolen by an identity thief call the customer service number for the company and find out when your bill was sent let them know you haven t received it if you think it was possible that it was stolen let them know that as well 22 x research source sign up for electronic billing and you won t have to worry about identity thieves

certain goals for example be a better teacher is somewhat vague to make it a smart goal think about what areas you want to improve in and write goals that cater to those areas you could narrow down the following goal more for example you could say something like i would like to improve the sense of support in my classroom by fostering more one on one time with the students this is a measurable

also speak to success for example you could pledge at least a year to working on the student affairs committee in your graduate program order your career development on a timeline once you ve established a series of goals order your timeline in a logical trajectory start with your short term goals and move up to your longterm goals until you ve achieved your dream you essentially want to carve out a road map you ll follow to success you can start at the beginning look at the goals you want to achieve by the end of this month or year write them down in order at the beginning of your timeline including how you ll achieve these goals any possible setback and how you ll evaluate your success then move forward what do you want to achieve in the next two years the next five years the next ten years keep adding on your goals in order including setbacks means to measure them and means to achieve them for the example your career path may start with activities in graduate school these could include solid student teaching experience obtaining awards and honors and participating in graduate school organizations as you move forward you may want to gain an adjunct position then move on to more permanent work eventually your path should lead you to obtaining the role of a tenured professor of literature make note of milestones you should mark milestones on your career path these are important skills certifications awards and so on that you receive that will help you on your career know what kind of milestones you re striving towards and when you hope to achieve these milestones

membership into an honors society keep the plan dynamic your career plan is not set in stone keep in mind your goals may change over time you may need to tweak your career plan due to unforeseen

you flagged make sure you note everything even volunteer experience personal projects and education and never cut yourself short if you re proud of something it s likely worth noting many career qualifications are more of guidelines than strict policies especially for non science tech jobs think about how your personal qualifications make you the best fit for the career not just how closely you hew to posted qualifications note any careers require hard black and white qualifications doctors must go to medical school lawyers law school etc there is little getting around this but if you re not bothered by the work up front this is a sign you might care enough about the career to give it a go do some volunteer intern or trial work periods in fields you enjoy this can be especially useful if you re not sure or if you have several choices and you can t make up your mind between them working for free or for little pay shouldn t go on indefinitely but it is useful for a short period to give you a good taste of what the career is like it is important to set this up through reputable companies and individuals to avoid being taken advantage of talk to people in potential careers and ask if you could shadow or follow them for a day or two to learn about the job first hand talk to your college s career center about placement internships and opportunities early on in school maintaining a relationship with the career center will pay dividends later on ask other people what they like about their careers this is a good way to gauge if people are are genuinely still fired up and enjoying what they re doing every day it also lets you ask question to put yourself in their shoes determining if you see yourself in that job this can really help you to decide what will work for you make sure you take some time to think of good specific questions that tell you about the career not just the job what do you enjoy most about a day of work what things did you wish you knew before starting your career where did you start to get to the position you are today what does a normal week in the life look like 3 x research source consider the mixture of work and free time you need to be happy remember a career is about much more than how much you make a year it might be really important to you to be able to spend a lot of time at home with children some careers will enable this others will obstruct this you should enjoy your work and it shouldn t be a burden but a career shouldn t take over your life if you don t want it to make this decision before looking for work it is perhaps the most important aspect of future job happiness and you should treat it with respect consider the career you want if all of the hurdles were crossed not the easiest one a really helpful set of questions can help you learn what you really above all want to do if you really care then the effort needed to fill in education gaps or issues will be totally worth it all they require is some honesty and a bit of courage to put yourself out there if i had the skills and education i would love to be a __________ if i had to go back to school i d major in __________ when i m retired i want to look back on a life spent _____________ 4 x research source remember that to get the career you want you might have to start with a job you don t everyone wants to be noticed for their incredible

that are recommended in your career if you don t have the qualifications for the job you want just yet jumping into a related job to get experience while you study up will bolster your resume compare

trade specific courses such as the cpa exam for accountants large or unique personal projects internships 6 x research source network nonstop to meet everyone you can in your industry networking has

aren t written down already write them down yourself who do you report to do you go through the same person each time develop good habits start off well and show your boss and co workers that you are

example even if it s not fulfilling to you realizing that it s important to learn how a project comes to fruition on the other hand if you are unfulfilled poorly compensated and with no possibility for advancement you probably should start looking for a new job as soon as possible change your course if you re not achieving as much as you had hoped in your current position or career trajectory it may be time to reassess your strategy for example you can seek a new job or even a new career that more closely matches your goals skills and interests in the same way note where and how you were able to achieve the most success and do it more often reassess your goals and motivations regularly to make sure you re still headed where you want to go if you aren t make a change immediately be clear

your career finally consider finding a mentor that can offer sponsorship a sponsoring mentor promotes you to the upper levels of your industry or company and can help you move up the ladder in this

she might be too busy to take you on in a mentee relationship so have a gracious response ready for that scenario if your first choice is unavailable move to the next person on the list and ask again

consider my offer dear mr j as a fellow alum of the wharton school i have been impressed by stories about your business acumen for years i ve recently moved to the bay area and am looking for career advice in your field would you be open to getting drinks with me one night and answering some of my questions i know that you are a very busy man with many other colleagues wanting your advice and mentorship but i hope that we can find a time to meet interview each candidate mentoring requires a close personal relationship so the interview should be used as a time to see if a potential relationship would be mutually satisfactory this means that the interview should go both ways with both parties asking questions of each other you can start by asking for advice ask all of them a work related question and see their response did they give good advice in a way that made sense to you did they perhaps not even respond how the possible mentor responded can tell you a lot about their

growth opportunity in your old career path consider the consequences there may be unintended consequences or costs of your job search finding a job can takes months of applications and planning look at a variety of job sites in your area to be sure that you see all of the possible openings in your chosen field you should also consider what your current employer will think of your job search

thereof room to move up within the same company etc no job is perfect and few of us stay in our first jobs for the rest of our lives think about whether the job you are considering is right for your

work culture for example if you see a lot of common areas with chairs and sofas for employees to gather then the company likely values collaboration among its employees however if you see mostly cubicles then the company likely values individual effort and does not encourage collaboration assess your experience of the interview think about how you were treated throughout the interview process and whether that treatment indicates that the company is a good fit for you 14 x research source you might ask yourself did the employer show respect for my time by starting the interview on time and notifying me of any changes or delays to the interview schedule you might ask yourself did the employer show genuine interest in my responses and my experience you might consider did the employer seem genuinely interested in my career goals and aspirations or were they just asking rote questions be wary of companies that use another company to do their hiring some companies use job placement agencies to get the majority of their employees and this may indicate that the company has a high turnover rate if the turnover rate is high then the company may not be a pleasant place to work even if the company does its own hiring you may want to ask about the typical length of time that people stay with the company reflect on whether you feel you are doing well at your job if you feel like you are good at doing your job this is a sign that it is at least partially a good fit however if you feel like nothing comes naturally to you at work you may be in the wrong job 15 x research source

very difficult after many years of doing it perhaps this job is not ideally suited to you perhaps other kinds of carpentry would be more rewarding you can also check in with yourself every day before you go to work to see how you are feeling about it for example if you dread going to work every day then this is a good indication that you should look for something different review the feedback that you have received at your current position if you have received some positive feedback recently this may be a sign that the job is a good fit for you however if you are constantly getting negative feedback at your position and experiencing very few rewards the position may not be a good fit for you 16 x research source if you receive feedback from your boss orally try to write down the feedback that you receive for a few months at the end of a few months review your notes and make a list of all of the areas needing improvement and all of the positive feedback if the feedback is mostly negative or in the needing improvement area you may need to consider other work examine whether the job allows you to be yourself if you feel like you can be yourself at your job this is a sign of a good fit if you feel like you can t be yourself at the workplace or your identity is marginalized the job might not be a good fit 17 x research source if you are differently abled consider whether your employer takes steps to make this job and the workplace more accessible if you are out in the workplace as part of the lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer or questioning i e lgbtq community consider whether your employer has a lgbtq employee resource group lgbtq resource groups share information on lgbtq issues and events at the company and help connect lgbtq identified people in the company 18 x research source talk to friends and family about your job if you enjoy chatting with your friends and family about your work and feel a spark of passion about work related subjects this can be a sign of a positive match if you really don t like talking about your work this may be an indication that your passion for the position has dwindled or was never there 19 x research source bring up the subject of work at your next family event if you find yourself enjoying the experience of talking about your current job perhaps you are happy in your current position however if you find it painful or stressful to talk about you should consider why the subject is so difficult to talk about ponder whether you are doing it for the money it is fine if you are partly motivated by the money but you should have other reasons for doing the work if you are really just doing the job to make a buck it might not be a good fit 20 x research source there are many people who manage to find work doing what they love whatever that may be so look around and try to find yourself a job doing something you are passionate about 21 x research source consider what type of work you would like to do if money were not an issue if you would still be doing your job or something similar then this is a good indication that your job is a good fit for you if you d rather be doing something totally

that will keep you actively engaged during your entire work day if you are interviewing pay attention to the demeanors of the staff and to the overall buzz of the office 4 x research source if the staff seems upbeat and excited this could be an indication that the office environment is fast paced if you hear laughter this could also be an indication of a fun and dynamic office structure pay attention to the colors of the office and the artwork oftentimes you can tell how the office structure is by looking at your physical surroundings inquire about management styles as a person with adhd you are very likely to need autonomy clearly defined expectations and open lines of communication should you secure an interview with a potential employer ask them about their style of supervision and see if it lines up with your needs and values 5 x research source if your potential boss says that they are looking for someone that needs little to no instruction consider if this role would be

realize that you will also have to be flexible as well talk to current staff if possible if you know of someone who works in the department or office that you are interested in or have secured an interview with reach out to them to ask if they can tell you about their experience during the interview most employers like to portray their office in the best light possible and can sometimes be misleading get the inside scoop if possible to determine the true office dynamics and structure you can also ask these staff questions during the interview if they are present most interviews will not only be with the boss or supervisor but with some of their staff as well don t make a decision based solely on what a staff person says however consider all of the information available to you when deciding on a job ask key questions during the interview if you should have any hesitations or concerns about a particular job or office then you should make those concerns known by asking questions during the interview don t be alarmist but do seek to understand this decision will be an important one for you so it is critical to have as much information as possible 6 x research source for instance don t ask things like why do you have such a high staff turnover rate but instead ask how do you incentivize talented staff to stay rather than moving on to other opportunities you might ask

this is not the end you are unlikely to feel completely happy every day at your job and that is okay and perfectly normal recognize that you can make certain tweaks to your environment to ensure that you are able to both manage and use your adhd to your advantage consider the following options ask to use flex time to come in late some days and stay late so that you are working during your peak hours and when less coworkers are around take structured breaks throughout the day to give your brain a break consider taking a quick walk outside or inside the building make physical tweaks to your

every so often when you have a lot of work or are feeling unfocused limit the items on your desk so that you don t get distracted use the power of multitasking in your new career make sure that you are using your adhd to your full advantage oftentimes people with adhd are better at multitasking than is the person without adhd take advantage of this skill by working on multiple tasks at once 7 x research source for instance consider taking phone calls and responding to emails simultaneously don t press send until after proofreading however use the power of focus many consider a lack of focus as being the primary issue of those with adhd however recognize that when you do focus on a task you can be zoned into that task for hours and complete it even faster than someone without adhd avoid getting sidetracked on meaningless tasks or in social media but instead immerse yourself in your work and you will yield positive results 8 x research source take note of any time that you get distracted and what is distracting you likewise take note of times when you are in the zone and working exceptionally well pay attention to what might be promoting your productivity so that you can try to replicate it later on make lists each week you should have a list of all of the projects or assignments that you need to complete as well as a list of larger projects that need attention now this will assure that you do not forget about a task and miss a deadline consider putting these tasks on your calendar so that you plot out time to work on them 9 x research source plan your day ahead of time at the end of each day you should have a well developed plan for the following day so that you know what time you should arrive to work what you will be doing all day and what time you will leave review your calendar at the end of each day so that you enter into the next day ready and prepared 10 x research source you can plan out your social events as well if you struggle with lists plans or schedules then see if you can locate an adhd coach or therapist to help you develop these skills request assignments that interest you one of the best ways to assure that you are focused and engaged in the work you re doing is by requesting assignments that interest you there will be many little mundane tasks that you are required to do that are perhaps of little to no interest to you you can balance this by signing up to do things that you will enjoy for instance if your boss is looking for someone to assist with a mentoring program run out of the office and you enjoy working with children this might be a good fit for you keep in mind that you do not have to wait for your boss to request something if there is a project that interests you and that you would like to work on then let your boss know set short term goals inform your boss of the goals that you have set to keep yourself accountable this will help ensure that you do not get lazy in your role and that you are always pushing yourself to be the best version of you that is possible it will also help guarantee that you do not get bored at work and will help you develop professional skills that will be helpful to you both now and in the future for instance perhaps a goal you have is to improve your students average test scores by three points on the next test communicate this to your supervisor and then put an action plan in place to achieve your goal be sure to create a visual reminder of your goals for example you can write them on a piece of paper and post it somewhere you will see it daily,Work-World

people find that they enjoy doing the things they re naturally good at start keeping a career journal or diary it may sound cheesy but a journal is a pursuit that will force you to collect your thoughts and start to be honest about your feelings and aspirations which is a tough thing to do use your journal to collect all your positive thoughts insights and leads that you gather over the course of your job search stoke your natural curiosity get curious there are several reasons why it pays to be curious for one the curious person is usually a learning person and employers are looking for candidates who are eager not just willing to learn on the job second the curious person is more likely to find a better job fit for him or herself by asking why ask yourself why you like what you do begin to probe perhaps you re passionate about sprinting for example but don t excel at it if you tried to become a sprinter you probably wouldn t succeed but if you realized that you loved the physiology behind sprinting you might choose to become a sports doctor 1 x research source the curious person constantly tries to understand more about the both the world and themselves making the job career switch easier decide whether to tell your boss that you ll be looking for a new job this is one of those really tough decisions that crops up as you switch jobs there are advantages and disadvantages to telling your boss ultimately it ll be up to you to make an informed decision about what s best to do in your case advantages you could get a counter offer to stay which would make your job more bearable although not necessarily more meaningful you give your boss ample time to find a replacement you leave your current company not having burned bridges and having been honest about your feelings disadvantages you could not get a job offer for several months leaving you in a transitional period permanently your boss may think you re simply angling for a pay bump your boss may begin to distrust your work and make you feel less relevant as time goes on sort out all the personal documents you need to start applying to different jobs get all the administrivia out of the way pretty early on touch up your resume or spruce up your cv bone up on how to write a cover letter if you need to begin diplomatically soliciting letters of recommendation from people who know you well and are positively disposed to saying something nice about you other things to think about learn how to interview well and form excellent interview questions learn how to protect your online reputation sort out your elevator pitch if you haven t already start networking networking is probably the single most important step in your new job search that s because referrals and personal connections and let s face it nepotism make up the bulk of how people land jobs these days why referred candidates tend to perform better than random hires and stay on the job longer 2 x research source so the next time you drag yourself to a networking event when you know you could be sitting at home in your pjs eating ice cream tell yourself it s for your new unrealized job remember that people hire people not resumes making an impression in a face to face human exchange is extremely important people hire people that they like not necessarily those with the best resume or even qualifications networking can seem pretty daunting especially for introverts the most important things to remember are that the other person is probably nervous too and that no one thinks about you as much as you think about yourself if you mess up no biggie just brush it off they re probably thinking about themselves not about you identify and speak to people who do what you think you d like to do say you want to switch jobs and become a parole officer for example well try to find someone a friend of a friend will do who s a parole officer and ask them out to lunch for an informational interview it might even be a good idea to talk to a warden and ask them the qualities of a good parole officer for example more often that you might guess informational interviews lead directly or indirectly to job offers 3 x research source during your informational interview ask them questions about their personal career path and their current job how did you find the job what did you do before you were a occupation what s the most satisfying part of your job the least what s a typical day look like for you what s your advice for someone trying to break into the field establish personal relationships with companies or organizations you determine you d like to work for it s not called pounding the pavement for nothing going in to companies in person and asking to speak to hr about job openings isn t as high success as networking or getting a referral but it s higher success than blindly stabbing in the dark with online applications here s what you do reach out to hr directly and describe your experience or your desired job market yourself briefly then ask are there any positions open that might align with my skills and expertise prepare to leave your contact info and or a resume or cv with the hr department don t be discouraged if hr effectively says no ask if you can be updated if when a position comes up and leave your contact info if you re still interested in the organization after a month or two follow up with hr and show renewed interest not a lot of people do this and it shows real courage and persistence two great traits to have apply to different jobs online applying to different jobs online via jobs bulletins is impersonal and easy which explains why so many people do it it s fine if you apply to jobs online but you should probably couple your online search with more personal interactions to up your chances of success the goal is to distinguish yourself from the herd not blend in volunteer if necessary to try out a job or career on for size if you re not finding much luck searching for leads volunteer in your free time for a position you care about it doesn t have to be long hours but it should be something that exposes you to the real meat of the job volunteering looks great on resumes and occasionally turns into a paid position practice job interviewing before the real deal you can practice with a friend or mentor or simply try to secure as many interviews as possible and learn as you go getting a few practice interviews in is really good practice you ll be surprised how good the mileage is when it comes time to ace your interview ace the interview whether it s a group interview phone interview behavioral interview or something in between interviews can be daunting because we re asked to distill our personalities and skills into bite size sound bytes while appearing relaxed and personable all the while few things in life can seem as difficult as your first job interview here are a couple pointers to remember as you get ready to jump into the world of interviewing again just like networking the person interviewing you is probably nervous as well they want to make a good impression too they want you to think favorably of their company the stakes might not be as high for them but don t for a second think that being in the driver s seat for an interview is a piece of cake part of their performance is going to be judged on the merit of the candidates that they bring in pay attention to your body language during the interview if you get an interview it means there s something about you that the potential employer thinks might fit in their system that s great and while you can t change your skills and your expertise mid stride in the interview you can change how you present yourself look the interviewer in the eye remember to smile work on your handshake be polite and err on the side of modesty without being totally abnegating keep your interview answers succinct when you re under the heat of the microscope time starts to dilate and a lot of people feel like they re not talking enough when in fact they re talking too much pause after you feel like you ve incisively addressed the question if the interviewer maintains eye contact without speaking that s probably a cue that they expect further elaboration if the interviewer launches into the next question you ve kept your answer at a good length keep a positive attitude during and after the interview there will be interviews that you bomb that s just a fact of life don t get down on yourself for a poor interview instead learn from your mistakes and apply those lessons to future interviews during the interview especially don t let negativity affect your approach many people think they do much worse than they come off follow up with all the interviewers job and informational you sit down with show continued interest in the people you ve talked with after your interview shoot off a quick email saying how pleasant it was to meet the person if you didn t clarify how long you were expected to wait during the interview clarify now people respond to other people not necessarily to paper making sure you treat the interviewer like a person first and foremost will go a long way toward cementing your eligibility as a top candidate when you get your job offer negotiate a salary and benefits a lot of applicants are a little meek when it comes to negotiating their salary because they re just happy they have jobs believe in your self worth and translate that faith to your financial worth research the starting salaries of similarly experienced candidates in similar fields and geographic regions then when it comes to naming a number name a specific figure like 62 925 instead of merely saying 60k it will make you appear like you ve really done your homework 4 x research source don t submit your letter of resignation until you ve landed a job you know you re going to take wait until you ve got an offer in writing before you go to your current soon to be ex boss and let him or her know that you ll be leaving try to schedule the start of your new job so that you give your old company at least two weeks to find a replacement 5 x research source any less time and your old company will be manically struggling to find a replacement making them feel resentful towards you any more time and you ll begin to feel like a lost ducky who s overstaying their welcome and becoming increasingly irrelevant transition from one job to the next without burning any bridges it s hard to stay focused or mask your enmity for some employees when you know you re going to leaving soon dig in here are some things that you should remember while you re waiting out your final two weeks at your old job 6 x research source don t pack your bags before you ve left don t check out stay focused during your last days on the job instill trust in your manager that you re fully present and committed to doing your work for as long as you stay at the company don t speak out publicly against any of your old bosses or colleagues this kind of public guillotining gets around and doesn t exactly keep relations tight with your old employer or reassure your new one say goodbye to your old colleagues shoot out an email blast to everyone if you re leaving a small company or those people you ve worked with if it s a larger company letting them know you re moving on keep it quick and simple no need to elaborate on why then write personal notes to select individuals you established a really good working relationship with let them know

how to start a career,starting a career is about making choices as to what you want out of life well into the future you could be switching careers starting fresh or just looking to see what is out there either way it s important to find out what fits best so that you don t burn out mid stream after years of trying to fit into something that isn t your strength,list your strengths talents and passions even those not related to typical careers you should find a career that fits your unique skills and loves not one that you hope you ll enjoy once started a career is something your work on and build for years a job is something you just do to pay the bills if you don t think about yourself first and foremost chances are good you ll be bouncing around careers a lot 1 x research source is there a particular field entertainment healthcare finance etc that you want to zero in on what are your absolute needs in a job high salary helping others working with kids etc what are your absolute turn offs in a job work without helping others work 50 hours go back to school etc what do you know well or have studied even little things make a big difference here volunteer work classes or hobbies odd jobs passionate extracurricular etc don t feel like there is a right answer to picking a career there is not this is about finding your wants and needs then looking for the career that matches them later 2 x research source dive online into research about careers you re interested in if you re unsure about which career you want make a list of 5 10 you might like and then start researching them search online for ______ careers and start clicking don t neglect to add new jobs to your list as they come up either you may realize for example that becoming an actor has a high burden to entry with low job security and uncertain hours but being a production assistant working on film sets is much more manageable start and can lead to a variety of film careers keep notes as you do research remember this is supposed to be fun so look for jobs that get your excited and thinking about the future have fun with this look for jobs that excite you even if you can t exactly say why be sure to make notes about needed or recommended qualifications as you search take an honest look at your current qualifications more often than not the career you want is going to need some training experience or prior recommendations to get involved in never fear however if you feel a little under qualified at the moment the point is to see what you would theoretically need to do to get into each career you flagged make sure you note everything even volunteer experience personal projects and education and never cut yourself short if you re proud of something it s likely worth noting many career qualifications are more of guidelines than strict policies especially for non science tech jobs think about how your personal qualifications make you the best fit for the career not just how closely you hew to posted qualifications note any careers require hard black and white qualifications doctors must go to medical school lawyers law school etc there is little getting around this but if you re not bothered by the work up front this is a sign you might care enough about the career to give it a go do some volunteer intern or trial work periods in fields you enjoy this can be especially useful if you re not sure or if you have several choices and you can t make up your mind between them working for free or for little pay shouldn t go on indefinitely but it is useful for a short period to give you a good taste of what the career is like it is important to set this up through reputable companies and individuals to avoid being taken advantage of talk to people in potential careers and ask if you could shadow or follow them for a day or two to learn about the job first hand talk to your college s career center about placement internships and opportunities early on in school maintaining a relationship with the career center will pay dividends later on ask other people what they like about their careers this is a good way to gauge if people are are genuinely still fired up and enjoying what they re doing every day it also lets you ask question to put yourself in their shoes determining if you see yourself in that job this can really help you to decide what will work for you make sure you take some time to think of good specific questions that tell you about the career not just the job what do you enjoy most about a day of work what things did you wish you knew before starting your career where did you start to get to the position you are today what does a normal week in the life look like 3 x research source consider the mixture of work and free time you need to be happy remember a career is about much more than how much you make a year it might be really important to you to be able to spend a lot of time at home with children some careers will enable this others will obstruct this you should enjoy your work and it shouldn t be a burden but a career shouldn t take over your life if you don t want it to make this decision before looking for work it is perhaps the most important aspect of future job happiness and you should treat it with respect consider the career you want if all of the hurdles were crossed not the easiest one a really helpful set of questions can help you learn what you really above all want to do if you really care then the effort needed to fill in education gaps or issues will be totally worth it all they require is some honesty and a bit of courage to put yourself out there if i had the skills and education i would love to be a __________ if i had to go back to school i d major in __________ when i m retired i want to look back on a life spent _____________ 4 x research source remember that to get the career you want you might have to start with a job you don t everyone wants to be noticed for their incredible talent and passion but that usually happens after you get hired paying your dues is not a ton of fun but it is necessary in most industries most importantly this is where you actually get to learn the job from the bottom up look at it less as an entry level job and more of your on the job training and it will be much easier to accept 5 x research source ask around for the types of entry level jobs that are recommended in your career if you don t have the qualifications for the job you want just yet jumping into a related job to get experience while you study up will bolster your resume compare your qualifications against those needed for the career you ve chosen then look for ways to fill the gaps this isn t always fun but an honest comparison of yourself against your career is necessary to

how to transfer jobs,if you like the company you are working for but need to make a slight job change in regards to your location or department you can explore your options for a lateral transfer a

though you are already working for the company making a transfer may not be as easy as you think in order to maximize your chances of a successful transfer you need to make the decision search for openings and interview and prepare for a transfer,assess why you want to transfer what is your basic motivation are you bored disaffected do you need a bigger challenge is your job too demanding and you want a better work life balance be sure that you are making an educated decision transferring departments is doable for example 1 3 of the british grocery chain sainsbury s 500 yearly recruits for retail management transfer to other operations 1 x research source but you should have a good reason try putting your thoughts on paper don t over think or over rationalize write down why you feel the need to move emotions and all evaluate your reasons now that you ve stated your reasons it is time to decide whether they are legitimate understand that some reasons to transfer are good and others not as good for example you may be new to your department and not feel suited to the job improper fit is a legitimate reason to transfer so is the desire for a greater challenge or the need to balance your life simple boredom or unhappiness need more thought though all jobs have ups and downs what is behind your boredom is it something that might change after a time like routine or is it a bigger problem like you feel unchallenged and unmotivated more good reasons to transfer include relocating to different state or part of town seeking better team or department fit issues with your direct supervisor and striving to meet career goals your current job cannot offer less compelling reasons include taking issue with company policies or procedures ethical concerns or problems with executive level management none of the above will change much with a transfer and you may find yourself leaving the company shortly after transferring do not be think that a transfer will be a quick fix for your personal and or work issues if your issues wind up being company wide the grass may not be greener on the other side it may be harder to transfer if you work for a small company where many co workers are lifers and roles are clearly set in that case an external move might be better 2 x research source network and build strong relationships network with those you are interested in working with to help your chances of landing a transfer building genuine mutual connections and making yourself known will help you find advocates advocates who can promote your cause 3 x research source get

get you a close look networking can be easier at a small company with fewer steps does your boss or the owner do all the hiring herself talk to her frankly about your interest if she is amenable she might come directly to you the next time she is looking to hire she may even allow you to apply before others research and apply for internal job openings many companies make job openings available to current employees before they are advertised outside of the company be on the lookout for such postings try to find them on the company intranet in the break room or by asking hr use your network to get info for example if you d like to transfer to the marketing department and sometimes talk with sarah in marketing as part of your current job ask her about possible openings even if nothing is available at the moment she may alert you in the future when a job opens if you know someone in hr mention your interest there once you have found a suitable position put forward a professional application but be discreet other people you know will apply for the same vacancy 4 x research source take the process seriously the biggest mistake you can make is to assume that you will get special consideration as a known entity in fact this might actually make things harder as no one wants to be accused of cronyism act as you would with any outside job follow the process submit an up to date resume a first rate cover letter and approach the application with professionalism you may have an advantage if you are allowed to apply for the job before outsiders however you may not remember that others at your company could also be pursuing the same opportunity be selective about applying for internal jobs management will take you less seriously if they know that you apply for anything and everything 5 x research source be upfront with your supervisor make sure that your direct supervisor and hr know about your application you should avoid giving insult at all costs if you have an understanding boss for example you could hurt her and lose a powerful advocate by not being upfront she might be able to put in a good word for you 6 x research source if on the other hand your boss is easily offended try to be as diplomatic as possible with her about your desire to transfer make it clear that the issue is not personal e g you re a great supervisor and i ve really enjoyed working for you it s only that i want to expand my career opportunities she will find out eventually and it is better that she hear it from you if you don t feel comfortable going to your supervisor or your

that you have an inside track to hiring managers this seems unprofessional and arrogant 8 x research source as the harvard business review points out there are many things that can negate your

up with a clearer idea of what direction you want your career to go in you may even decide you prefer staying in your current role or company making detailed career plans will help you to stay focused on your goals consider setting a 6 month plan covering what you need to do in the near future and a 2 to 5 year plan for long term goals identify the kinds of jobs you feel comfortable applying for once you know where you want to end up start figuring out how to get there this will depend on what kind of work you enjoy doing and are trained to do besides a salary and benefits jobs come with the opportunity to learn new skills and take on new challenges you may decide that you need to go back to school take a different role in the company or even relocate to find what is right for you 2 x research source compare your current role to similar roles with other organizations also look at jobs in higher levels and in different sectors to see what you skills you have and are lacking if you know what kind of role you want you can start working toward it right away don t be too concerned if your skills or experience level aren t exact matches for the jobs you re searching for get a sense of what is available and what you re interested in update your resume to include your current job it s easy to forget about your resume until you need it if you haven t already set aside some time to indicate your current employment and any skills you have gained from it relate all of this information to your goals and what you re looking for in a new job 3 x research source for example if you want to change careers prepare a functional resume to show off your transferable skills however if you are looking for a similar position to the one you currently hold write a chronological resume that highlights your most relevant and beneficial work experiences get into the habit of updating your resume every 3 months so you re not stuck doing it while juggling a job and a job search it is useful for analyzing your own performance and future goals even if you re not actively searching outside your current company you never know when a good opportunity will show up write a cover letter tailored to each position you apply for a cover letter is the front page of your resume and introduces yourself and your qualifications it is designed to make you look like a valuable job candidate for that reason read the job description for the position you are applying for and write a brief couple of paragraphs about why you want it use it to draw attention to the most important parts of your resume 4 x research source before you start the job search process in earnest write up a sample cover letter tweak it over time to make it relevant for specific jobs having a basic template saves you time later on while you can submit a generic cover letter to each job that is boring a good cover letter makes you stand out from other applicants and shows employers that you want to work for them look for job listings in postings online and in print there are many ways to look for a new job but most people start with quick searches for open availabilities check out your local newspaper job posting boards in your community or go to a job posting website look for recent jobs that match your skills and qualifications send your updated resume and cover letter to start the process of transitioning from your old job 5 x research source keep in mind that job hunting can be a lengthy experience you might not find anything you like and you may not get called into interviews right away if you re certain you want to leave your old job stay with it and be patient as you search find jobs by networking with other people many people hear about new openings from people they know through networking you extend your contacts to the roles you re interested in taking your current coworkers are a good starting point so listen for any opportunities they discuss speak with outside sources you know and forge new connections for more opportunities 6 x research source for example go to a networking event for professionals in your area if you re looking at a specific industry or company reach out to people in those roles send an email or invite them out for coffee another option is through social media update your profile information but be discreet about it tell only people you trust that you re looking for something new networking is the fastest way to get into an interview so having a big network is helpful when you re looking to make a change it beats blindly applying to every interesting job opening you see keep your job search a secret from your boss and coworkers even though there is nothing wrong with exploring new opportunities your current employer may take your search personally it often becomes a distraction when an employer doesn t take it in stride your boss may think you re not focused on your current job or they may treat you differently remember that your bosses and coworkers have their own priorities so your job search isn t a great subject of conversation at work 7 x research source letting the news leak could harm your relationship with your current employer bosses and supervisors may no longer consider you for new opportunities or promotions the job search is often a long process so keep your options open and don t burn any bridges be careful about telling your coworkers since that increases the chance that your boss hears the news through the grapevine if you re leaving your boss needs to hear it from you first not through office gossip search for jobs on your own time instead of at work one of the most important considerations when searching for a new job is timing keep up business as usual while you re searching most companies have the ability to monitor online searches and emails done at the office using company resources to search is inconsiderate and could get you in trouble 8 x research source think of it this way you re thinking of leaving so your employer has plenty of reason to let you go if you re doing something wrong stay professional by focusing on your work maintain a good relationship with your employer you re going to have to make time for the job search such as during evenings and weekends maintaining a regular job while searching for new opportunities can be tiring but it pays off once you re able to leave on amicable terms leave your current boss off the reference portion of your resume it backfires when your prospective employer rings your current boss unless your boss knows you re planning on leaving and gives you their blessing this is a bad way to break the news don t be surprised if your boss trusts you less your boss could even be shocked enough to serve as a negative reference 9 x research source you still need 3 to 7 references on your resume so find people you trust former employers colleagues teachers and supervisors are a few examples of good references give your contact a heads up to let them know you re listing them as a contact try to avoid using current coworkers as references since that would spoil your secret if you have to use a current coworker choose someone you re sure you can trust limit what you post to social media sites although professional networking sites are a great tool for self promotion they could also spoil your search update your profile so it s current but don t post anything more than that expect your boss and coworkers to spot anything out of the ordinary criticism of your current job as well as sharing job openings you are interested in could get back to your employer 10 x research source when using these sites don t advertise the fact that you are actively searching for new jobs that means no status updates if you don t have any work contacts on your profile set it to private be wary of uploading your resume to online job websites someone in your company could see it and alert your boss take calls from other companies outside of your office leave your work email and phone number off of your resume the search is your private business you wouldn t let your boss barge into your home to make work calls so be respectful of your surroundings use a personal email address and phone number to ensure your current job and your future one don t cross 11 x research source if you have to speak to a potential employer during the workday try to do it on your lunch break using a cell phone step outside on your call and head for your car or another private location if you have your own office you could go there and shut the door to ensure you get a little privacy check your personal email and phone number at least once a day when you get home from work try to refrain from checking anything at work if a message is time sensitive wait for your lunch break to reply accept a new job offer before resigning from your current job wait for the potential employer to check your references and give you a firm starting date the last thing you need is for the offer to be withdrawn right after you submit your resignation in the meantime keep your options open get through your current work responsibilities while keeping an eye on other opportunities as they arise 12 x research source there are some times when leaving your job is the better option for example it could give you more time to search and learn new skills especially if you re unhappy with where you re at use your discretion to make the best choice for your situation remember to stay professional by giving your current employer adequate notice of your intentions at a minimum give at least 2 weeks notice so your boss has time to prepare for your departure rehearse for potential questions you may be asked at an interview after applying to a few jobs you will hopefully hear back from a few of them prepare for these interviews by reading more about the company and your potential job duties come up with some basic answers about what skills you re bringing to the company and other questions you are likely to hear try practicing by answering questions in the mirror or with some friends 13 x research source dress yourself for success look professional such as by wearing a clean shirt and business pants or a skirt remember to follow up after an interview if you really want the job contact your interviewer to thank them and ask them for a status update come up with a good reason for leaving your current job an interview isn t a good place to air your dirty laundry potential employers are looking for positive hard working employees with a lot to offer simply tell them that you want to join a company that values your skills and will let you utilize them more fully avoid harshly criticizing your current job if you can help it 14 x research source for example if you don t like your current boss say although i like the company s mission i decided it was better to go in a different direction it s okay to say that you want new challenges to continue to grow you could also point out that you were a bad fit for your old job try to point out your current job s positive points so you don t sound too grim schedule interviews outside of your ordinary work hours if possible set your interviews before or after your work hours try to organize them for the weekend or during your lunch break if those are options this all depends on your own work schedule and how it syncs up with your potential employer as long as you aren t slipping away from work when you re on the clock you re taking a professional approach that your employer has to respect 15 x research source if you have no other alternative take time off for the interview schedule a half day or take off for personal time but don t lie if you can help it instead of calling in sick tell your employer that you need time off for personal reasons or family business if you end up scheduling an interview around your work schedule be aware of what you re wearing your boss and coworkers will know something is up if you suddenly show up in a suit and tie store your interview clothes in a bag or stop at home if you need to change stay calm and collected when going through interviews interviews are stressful so it s not surprising that a lot of people get nervous control your energy so you are able to treat interviews like a conversation stay friendly and answer questions to the best of your ability it will increase your chances of getting hired 16 x research source interviewers get plenty of potential candidates who talk quickly and loudly because they are so ready to get out of their old job they can spot when a candidate is desperate to leave a position focus on the job you re applying for instead of the one you re leaving,Work-World

strategies you can make your resignation as smooth and as grudge free as possible,try to leave on a high note most people hand in their resignation when they are burnt out and feel like they can t

to coworkers find out how your departure should be communicated to the rest of the staff once you have spoken with your boss you boss may send out a company wide email or they may ask you to send out your own personal notice do not mention your departure to anyone before you have discussed these details with your boss tie up any loose ends you may have this is both a respectful and considerate thing to do and your boss and your coworkers are sure to appreciate it finish up projects that you have and prepare guidelines for the person who will fill your position consider creating a file that explains where you left off on any long running projects and other essentials your replacement might need to know about things you worked on make sure all of your files are in order labeled and easily located you don t want to have frantic coworkers calling you after you have left the company because they can t find one of your files 3 x research source this is especially important if you are working on a team once you have given your 2 weeks notice discuss with your team which individuals will take on which duties until a replacement is found for you know what not to write in a resignation letter you don t need to include personal information such as your reason for leaving if it is something like a divorce or career change never write anything rude derogatory or simply mean

back to haunt you 4 x research source example of what not to write mr anderson i quit i hated working here you are stupid you also owe me 3 000 in vacation and sick days bob write a well written resignation letter there are quite a few details that can separate good letters from great letters in your letter follow the guidelines listed below a standard letter of resignation would read something like this dear mr spacely it has been my honor to work for spacely sprockets inc this letter is to notify you that i will be leaving to accept a new position with another company as of a date which is at least 2 weeks from the date of your conversation and letter please accept my thanks for our association and best regards to you and the entire company for the future sincerely george jetson be friendly and respectful if you were on a first name basis with your boss address the letter as such there is no need to sound stiff if you and your boss called each other by your given names plus using their first name adds a friendly touch to the letter that may lessen a bit of the sting show how much you appreciated working there even if you hated every second of your job try to find something complimentary to say something along the lines of i feel like i have learned a great deal about the art gallery world is complimentary even if you really mean i have learned a lot about the art gallery world and i am never ever going to be a part of it again reflect upon your achievements do not boast but do mention a few of the projects you worked on and how proud of them you are this is important to do because your letter of resignation will be filed away along with any negative remarks the higher ups may add to your file putting your achievements down will help you if you ever apply to a job that runs through the same hr department as your file will be accessed and your accomplishments will be one of the first things noted end on a warm note mention how you are grateful that you had the opportunity to work at this company and that you genuinely appreciate the people who work there including your boss you may want to add any names of people who you appreciate in particular for instance you could add i would never have been able to pursue my dream of becoming a prolific author without the insight i gained into the publishing industry by working at this wonderful company thank you for all your guidance with kind regards madeline miller have a copy of your letter of resignation in hand when you got to speak to your boss you should not email your letter as that is considered very unprofessional print it out and hand it to your boss when you meet with them to discuss your resignation ask your boss for a meeting to discuss an important matter poking your head in and asking for a moment of their time will do just be respectful of the fact that your supervisor has a job to do and may not be able to drop everything at the precise moment you are prepared to spring this news on them another option is to ask your boss if they will have time for a meeting the next day doing this gives them a chance to clear a bit of designated time to focus on your news if there is too much going on you will only add to their hassles so if it s at all possible wait for a time when your boss will have a few moments to focus on your news be prepared direct and polite rehearsing privately will help you be ready when your supervisor has you in to talk most managers are extremely busy and they will appreciate your direct approach forgoing the temptation to cushion the blow find the right way to say this or otherwise beat around the bush you might say something like i ve been considering my options here for some time and i ve decided it s time for me to move on i am grateful for the opportunities i ve found here but i must give my two weeks notice or i need to let you know that i have been offered a new position at another company i have really enjoyed working here but i need to give you my two weeks notice as of today my last day of work will be whatever two weeks from then is is this reasonable be prepared to discuss your reasons for leaving chances are you ve been working with this boss for some time and whatever your reasons are for leaving they may have some questions prepare a response that is concise and understandable 5 x research source if you are quitting because you hate your job try to frame your answers in an inoffensive way instead of i hate working here you might say i think its time that i head in a different direction with my career consider the possibility of a counter offer your boss may value you much more than you realized and make a counteroffer being polite and dignified about your resignation could make this possible you will need to consider in advance whether you would stay for a pay raise increased benefits a promotion or other incentives your meeting with your boss would be a prime negotiating opportunity so be prepared for it and know your own bottom line if staying is an option what would make you open to it however keep in mind that counter offers can have some serious downsides if you are given a counteroffer be sure to request for any counteroffer to be put in writing and signed those signatures would preferably be your boss supervisor and human resources when considering a counteroffer honestly evaluate why you want to leave and protect yourself while a raise might be nice it might not solve other issues that require either a promotion if your job advancement has stalled or a transfer to another group if you have personality conflicts with your boss emphasize the positive be honest but polite if the boss asks you if they had anything to do with your decision and they were a factor it s best to rely on tact and diplomacy to make an honest answer palatable in other words you won t help yourself by saying yes you re a lousy supervisor and i or anyone would have been way better off without you even if that s true you can be truthful without being cruel try saying something like i ve gotten an opportunity that will be a better fit for me in order to keep the terms about you rather than the environment or colleagues you re leaving think about the future remember the object of resigning gracefully is to always put yourself in a good position with the people you forged a relationship with while at work if you blow off everyone at your soon to be former workplace they probably won t write you a very nice letter of recommendation or perhaps not tell you about that sales job that they heard about through a friend being tactful courteous and smart about your departure will ensure that you ve given yourself the best possible shot at success in the future be aware that some bosses don t take kindly to you being the decider be sure you can truly afford to walk away from your job that day because sometimes the supervisor takes it very personally that you are leaving tell you there s no need to give notice and instruct you to leave immediately you will be the best judge of this so do your best to assess if your boss is one of these people but be aware sometimes you just can t predict what anyone will do re read your employment contract you must be aware of all the company s and your own termination options if there is no formal employment contract familiarize yourself with the default provisions of your state provincial law shake hands smile and thank your boss whether your departure is to relocate to take a better job or just to get away from a colleague you dislike show some class when you re walking out the door shake hands thank your soon to be former supervisor yay for everything and leave give notice to everyone else affected by your departure after informing your supervisor ask them if they will announce your departure if not be sure to personally tell other managers or key employees with whom you have worked that you have resigned say it in a way that thanks the person for helping you develop your career for example i don t know if you ve heard but i am resigning to take a position at another company before i leave i wanted to be sure to let you know how much i ve enjoyed working with you these people may leave for other jobs in the future and you want them to have positive memories of you

heat of the moment without a plan is never advisable however if you keep a clear head and develop a comprehensive strategy long before you deliver your letter of resignation you can quit your job in a down economy relatively unscathed,consider if you really should quit this job or if it s a case of experiencing a bad week or month dig deep into your soul to determine if it s the job or you are just taking a momentary beating by clients or the boss sometimes it s easy to feel as if you just want to flee when times get rocky at work so you ll need to take some time to do some real soul searching

profession some professionals go for decades in a job and suddenly decide they truly aren t cut out for the job and go in a completely different direction in order to find happiness examine which aspects of the job bring you down but also which areas you love you don t like the company or certain people or its vision goals etc if you feel affinity to your career choice but wonder if you re working for the right employer you may just need to determine if it s the entire company you don t like its future direction or just the folks in your department or surrounding team or all three you re feeling overworked without it being compensated or recognized that you ve taken on more work have you experienced any major changes at work during a tough economy companies often cut back and give remaining workers more tasks without additional pay consider if the company may just be going through tough times if you can stick it out the company will hopefully come out the other end on top and you could be better for staying around the company is failing or gradually imploding and you want to be long gone before this actually happens consider the options for changing your role within the workplace you re at before quitting sometimes this is a possibility that will enable you to take on new more challenging and more interesting work than the work you re currently doing if you re working somewhere that values you highly and isn t going to be happy to lose you this might be a way of developing yourself a new job without having to leave if you ve been given a promotion but you re still navigating the in s and out s of the job you might be feeling overwhelmed this is a situation you may just need to give more time before thinking of leaving don t be afraid of asking for training advice or support helping a trusted employee to move up in an organization will often be a cheaper option than replacing you bear in mind any clauses of your employment contract that prevent you from carrying on the same work either as an individual or for another company this may have a bearing on your decision to quit during hard times if your field or skills are quite specific it is also important to be careful about relying on existing clients for future work in some cases this will be unethical at least for a certain amount of time calculate what it takes for you to leave your current job for a new job or career choice before you even start submitting resumes and searching for a new job think about what it would take for you to financially leave your current company do you have savings and or a rainy day fund that would provide you with float during times you aren t receiving a paycheck savings are a buffer between you making sound reasoned choices or choices made out of desperation it s advisable to have three to eight months of salary equivalent saved up to give you the cushion needed to survive until the next job 1 x research source determine what you need to survive by comparing your total expenses to your net income include important bills including rent mortgage utilities tuition groceries auto insurance credit card bill s and car payments do you have enough in savings or a rainy day fund to sustain your lifestyle for a minimum of three months consider all expenses when measuring your income or savings versus expenses this includes recreation such as dining out clothing and movies and gas money look at your credit card balance your credit card isn t an option when you re not employed because there won t be income to pay off what you add to it can you pay it down to nothing now and only use it for items that are paid off within the no interest payment period this is a noose around your neck that you must take care of above all if you live paycheck to paycheck obviously you will need to make sure you have a sure thing lined up in terms of another job before telling your boss to take this job and shove it if you aren t saving already start now the sooner you do the sooner you can fulfill the dream of quitting your current job make a serious effort to line up another job even if you have money for float make a concerted effort to line up another job before quitting in a weak economy you will have to work extra hard but if you are truly miserable and need to quit your extra work will be worth the effort the internet may be your best bet when it comes to landing a new gig conduct a keyword search using your career choice and jobs for example if you are a writer search writing or writer jobs dozens of career websites should appear and lead you to possibilities in your area or in new locations if you are interested in moving tap into your network from linkedin to your current network of colleagues and friends covertly get the word out that you re looking to change companies or jobs consider leveraging your social network as well you never know where the next opportunity may be hiding try a head hunter from temp work to executive placement a head hunter is still a viable option remember a head hunter has to make money somehow so read any contract you sign carefully to ensure that the company who hires you will be paying the fee and not you think outside the box beyond jumping from one job to another consider what other options you might have sometimes it is easy to limit yourself to thinking you can only ever do a certain kind of job when in reality there are many other options provided you re willing to challenge your notions of what s normal in terms of work consider starting your own business you might have something that you ve always wanted to provide as a business however this isn t for the fainthearted you need the right set of skills knowledge and ability to run your own business and it s not for everyone don t see it as an easy solution but if you ve done your homework and you know you re right for it then it could be one solution investigate the possibilities while still in your current job so that you have done the necessary research and have developed a thorough business plan before quitting also some part time trying out of your business before you quit will help give you an idea of the business s likely success aka moonlighting consider contracting or temporary work while it s not permanent work if you have a particular skill that is in demand this can be an excellent way to make money in between jobs and while you re sorting yourself out sell things online it is thought that everyone has some things worth selling that are no longer wanted you can also branch out by investigating options of what you might be able to sell sourced from warehouses auctions estate sales and the like volunteer overseas have a total head space break and go overseas to help out for a while choose a scheme that doesn t require you to pay but that looks after your needs while you give of your time and expertise this isn t a job option but it is a chance to reorient your life in a meaningful way if this is an issue for you take the necessary steps to enter a new career path if you want to ditch your current career completely make sure you can quit your job and never look back if you need to go back to school think about how you will support yourself or your family while you are earning your degree talk to different schools about what it will take to get into a specific program before making any life changing decisions in some cases you ll need to fulfill several prerequisites which may possibly delay your career change plan you may not need to make such a big overhaul as getting a new degree investigate night school or adult training in areas that don t require years of high skilled training as well as bridging courses if you re already qualified in one area consider a part time job while you are learning a new trade or profession you ll still need income while you go to school so lining up a part time job is a good idea before putting your plan in action make sure everyone in the family is on board with your decision while you may have always dreamed of being a trapeze artist all of your life leaving your law job for the circus may not gel with the family especially when there is a mortgage school fees and next summer s vacation to pay for everyone affected by your decision needs to be accounted for and some of these people deserve a discussion about how your choice will impact their own choices and work decisions don t be surprised at the fear or shock from some family members many people believe that staying with a job matters above all else and even more so when times are hard you aren t going to be able to convince them otherwise so don t try simply remember that this is your choice and that they aren t in your work shoes but be understanding of their fears if they are in your immediate family you ll need to reassure them that you will still be responsible in your family role be ready for some colleagues and other outsiders to be negative there will be plenty of people who will insist that you ll never get another job in hard times realize that they re voicing their concerns and are afraid while it is understandable that some are fearful that is not a reason to stay stuck life is too short look to employment industries that are booming some industries are experiencing growth in areas such as energy aging services health care etc there are books available that explain which areas are in dire need of employees so it might pay to read one or two of these and see whether you re keen on reinvesting your time and effort to re skill yourself to work in one of these industries resign professionally and use the formal method required usually it is best to resign in writing using a standard form letter keep it brief and polite thanking the company for the opportunity you ve had to work for them provide your employer with enough time to hire your replacement if your employer has always shown you respect during your tenure return the favor by providing ample time for the company to find your replacement typically two weeks is an acceptable amount of time in the usa but one week may be enough time especially if the company has a flooded job pool ripe for the picking alternatively read the terms of your employment contract if you know someone perfect for your role help out your

told them personally 11 x research source stop into their office and break the news tell a consistent story you aren t obligated to tell others why you are leaving but they will want to know nonetheless accordingly you should settle on a story and stick with it 12 x research source your colleagues will talk to each other and compare notes don t tell one person you re leaving because you

someone you ve never met before let your boss or human resources inform these people that you are leaving absolutely fight the urge to trash the company in a good bye email no matter how angry you are

comments or performance evaluations in your personnel file 17 x research source now is the time to correct the record by providing context for example if you ve been criticized in the past for being tardy you can subtly explain why you can write something like this company has been incredibly understanding even when i was going through chemotherapy and missing some time at work i still managed to finish all of my work thanks to the thoughtful staff at abc corp remember to keep it brief and professional you shouldn t give a long winded defense in which you go point by point and rebut every criticism ever made of you instead explain away one or two of the major criticisms end the letter warmly 18 x research source repeat how grateful you are for having had the chance of working the job and then give the company your warmest regards also let the company know whether you re open to them contacting you with questions if you are provide your phone number and email address for example

how to say goodbye to coworkers,regardless of whether you re heading to greener pastures or quitting in frustration your last day at a job can be emotional try to make the most of your goodbye by making it heartfelt and inclusive because you might need some of your coworkers as professional or personal contacts in the future it s absolutely essential to do it tactfully and with grace whether you re doing it in person or over email saying goodbye doesn t need to be stressful,let everyone know you re leaving ahead of time your last day usually isn t the best time to let everyone know that you re not coming back it can seem hasty or rude to have one foot out the door and shout a so long before it closes take the time to let everyone know your plans and your schedule for leaving so everyone can be on the same page 1 x research source a rule of thumb is that the management needs at least two weeks notice ahead of time though more specific time tables for leaving may be built into your contract make sure that your bosses are the first to know after letting management know it s ok to tell your coworkers do so whenever you feel comfortable or whenever it s convenient but do it before your last day say your goodbyes ahead of time consider saying goodbye on your second to last day so that your last day can be less stressful and packed especially if you ve still got work to do waiting until the day before you leave will also give you the chance to finish up all of your projects without your coworkers flooding in to say goodbye 2 x research source once you have announced that you are leaving chances are that your coworkers will come trickling in to say goodbye because of this saying goodbye can be made easier if you are done with all of your tasks meet with people one on one get your stuff packed up early so that you can take the time to say goodbye to your coworkers individually doing this can give you both a sense of closure because this will be the last time that you meet together as coworkers however keep in mind that unless you are moving you will be able to see your coworkers outside of work if you really want to consider organizing a small event for your close coworkers outside of the office environment 3 x research source if your coworker is leaving and you re staying it might also be a good idea to get together a small group of coworkers to all go drop by and say goodbye at once this can make it a lot easier on your coworker by taking the first step network with people before you leave try to connect with as many coworkers as you can before you leave the office either through social media platforms or with email connect with people that you actually have an interest in staying in touch with but don t feel like you have to friend everyone on facebook to make it easier 4 x research source in the weeks before your departure consider beginning to connect with coworkers on business platforms like linkedin if you have not already this can be an excellent way to feel like you ve still got professional contacts and references at the ready if you should need them in the future keep it brief if you re in a professional environment treat it professionally there s no need for a big display or procedure tell your coworker that it s been nice working together wish them luck and tell them to get in touch sometime it doesn t need to be any more complicated than that 5 x research source if your coworker is leaving and you re staying try to remember that they ve got a lot of people to talk to and might not want to have a 45 minute long debrief with every single person even if you re sad to see them go keep it quiet and make plans later if necessary it would be perfectly fine to say something like mark it s been good working together keep things locked down around here you re a good guy let me know how you re doing ok maintain a positive attitude if you have been asked to leave or are leaving in frustration it may be challenging to keep your composure when you re saying goodbye to your coworkers however you should try to remain calm in order to present yourself in the most professional light stay positive and brief even if you re feeling frustrated you ll be glad you did invite close work friends to a more personal event after work workplaces can be a mixed bag you might have some real friends that you hope to stay in touch with some downright enemies that you can t stand and a whole bunch of people somewhere in the middle there s no sense in having a big party with everyone if the occasion doesn t call for it on the down low invite a few of your close friends to after work drinks or dinner to decompress after the day and talk more openly this can be an excellent way of spending a bit of time with the people your e legitimately interested in keeping in touch with outside of work make a company wide email inclusive if you bid farewell on a general level to your department or the entire company and it would be too difficult or complicated to do it door to door graciously thank everyone in the organization you should include people you didn t really know that well in order to foster a sense of company pride an email may include something like dear coworkers as you may have heard i will be leaving my position as your position tomorrow i just wanted to say that it has been a pleasure working with all of you i would love to stay in contact and can be reached at your email or on my linkedin profile cheers to the great times we have had working together sincerely your name keep a positive tone you might be tempted to openly write about the bitter times particularly if you were fired however it is advised that you keep a positive tone in order to present yourself in the best possible light being positive will also make it more likely that you will be able to network with your coworkers in the future it is always wise to end on a happy note so try to be as positive about your experience at the company as possible this is especially important if you are sending this email to your boss keep the email brief and to the point it should not be a long essay but a few sentences there is no need to disclose the actual reason for your leaving at length if people have questions you might encourage them to contact you directly or in person only mention that you are moving forward and have decided to try your hand at another career include your contact details if you want your goodbye email can end with your contact details clearly mention your mobile number email address and linkedin id through which you can keep in contact with your coworkers 6 x research source however do not share your personal contact information if you are not comfortable doing so you could also consider selecting only a few coworkers to share your information with an email can be an easy way of getting everyone on the same thread and sharing info together to make sure you ll all be able to get together in the future 7 x research source review your message before sending once you have finalized your draft read through it to make sure that it is free of errors and is grammatically correct you should also check to make sure that your tone comes across as friendly and positive while also being professional make sure that you have included everyone that you want to in your email consider reading your email out loud to see if any part sounds awkward talk to close friends in person it s usually a little cold to email your close work friends to let them know that you re leaving unless it s not possible try to say goodbye to them in person you need to let your superiors know in person or at least over the phone in most cases if you are unable to meet with your closest coworkers one on one for some reason you should send out personal emails telling them how much you have enjoyed working with them make sure that you give them your personal contact information so that you can stay in touch outside of the office an example personal email may include something like dear coworker s name as you have probably heard i am going to be leaving this company soon i have enjoyed working with you so much and will miss your positive energy i would love to stay in touch and hope that we can hang out outside of the office you can reach me on my phone number or at your email cheers to the time that we got to spend working together sincerely your name don t make false promises if you have no intention or desire to stay in touch with dennis from accounting don t layer on the false promises of getting together for a drink sometime aside from the fact that you might actually have to follow up on something you don t want to do it has the tendency to seem disingenuous and fake just be sincere and honest and don t feel any pressure to make plans with people you don t have any desire to make plans with if you feel rude making plans with some people and not others just keep your plans quiet no need in letting everyone know you re going to be getting together with one person on a regular basis to watch football if that ll offend some of your other coworkers don t use your last day to tell off your boss no epic walk out shouting no profanity laden tirades your last day should be quiet dignified and brief even if you feel like you ve been wronged in some way it s usually a bad idea to engage in any kind of shouting match with your boss who might have power in keeping you from getting your next job be a professional even if you don t feel like it if you ve got a legitimate beef that you need settled in words do it in person one on one and keep it as professional as possible tell your boss or whoever it is that you ve got a problem with that you d like a word in private to talk about some things at some workplaces it s common to do an exit interview in which you ll be able to voice your frustrations free of having to worry about how it will affect your job you re already leaving so there s no sense in speaking softly now don t bring gifts it s not important to shower your coworkers with gifts and it can have the effect of making some of your coworkers uncomfortable it s unnecessary and can seem ostentatious again it s a professional environment so act like it if you really feel the need to bring something a box of pastries or donuts for the floor would be a perfectly fine way of giving a little something nice back but don t feel like you need to pass around a bunch of ipods to say goodbye there s no need if your coworker is leaving and you want to wish them luck a card would be a perfectly friendly way of doing so again no need for gold watches don t denigrate the company to your coworkers if you re leaving don t use it as an opportunity to dump all your disappointments and frustrations at the feet of the employees who ll have to sweep them up after you leave try to leave on a positive note and don t make it awkward for everyone who has to stay likewise it s a bad idea to brag about how much better your new job is going to be if you re leaving for greener pastures try to remember that your coworkers still have to come back in on monday and you don t want to leave a toxic work environment in your wake don t just leave without saying anything the mystery will probably create a bad impression and leave behind a lot of suspicion for your other coworkers that might not be good for everyone if you re feeling awkward about leaving it s something you still need to get over and make personal for everyone again it doesn t need to be a big deal just keep it short and sweet and get out the door you ll be done soon,Work-World

belongings into a box and storm out instead take the time to say goodbye to your boss and your coworkers and tell them you ll stay in touch after all if you ve put in a lot of years at your company chances are that you ve developed some great relationships do stay in touch if it feels right you can send a group email to your coworkers giving them your contact information and even planning to hang out if you re really close avoid saying anything negative about your former company or coworkers in the future it can always get back to them and make you look bad and if your new employers hear you complaining about your old job you ll come off looking ungrateful and whiny weigh the benefits of getting fired versus quitting getting fired does not refer to driving your boss to the point where he or she wants to fire you this refers to speaking to your boss about leaving under the official reason for getting fired by leaving under this term you are able to collect unemployment and any other benefits you might have lost by quitting such as stock options until you find another job unemployment is only offered to people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own 8 x research source this only works in certain circumstances for example if you are working for a company and the responsibilities are too much for you to handle speaking to your boss frankly can lead to the company agreeing to let you go on good terms if you d like to choose this method you should have a good reason for wanting to get fired this means that you were valuable to the company but want to take time off to try a new project or to spend time with your family this method only works if you re not transitioning into a new job if you re switching to a new job then you ll be able to get the benefits and compensation of that job to make this work you have to have a strong relationship with your boss your boss should know you pretty well and should understand where you re coming from and how much value you bring to the company speak to your boss about the current situation this is a difficult thing to do but this could work out better for both of you after telling your boss that you want to leave you should have an honest conversation about wanting to be fired here s what you should do 9 x research source explain why you want to leave be honest it may be because you have too many current responsibilities at your position that you need to take a mental health break or that you want to pursue your own projects try to sway your boss to let you go rather than having you quit while you can t ask to be fired it should naturally come up in a conversation if you are close to your boss he might offer to let you go with the understanding that it can improve your post job situation realize that this means you have less control of your leave date if you are trying to get fired then you have no control over what your last date is it could be immediate or it could be much later file for unemployment once you ve made the agreement with your boss you can file your application for unemployment to meet the requirements of your state you ll receive unemployment checks until you can find another job,Work-World
how to quit your job without giving notice,in all u s states except montana employees are presumed to be at will employees this means that unless you have a written contract you have the right to quit whenever you want for any reason or even for no reason at all however many employers require that you provide two weeks notice when you quit if you don t the employer may refuse to give you a reference or withhold payment of accrued leave this means that if you want to quit your job without giving notice you need to carefully evaluate your company s policies and make sure it won t cost you more than it s worth 1 x research source,consider talking to someone in human resources first there may be options available to you if you want to quit without giving notice because you have a personal or family crisis or because you re the victim of workplace harassment 2 x research source 3 x research source if you have a problem with your work environment such as an abusive boss or coworker make sure the person with whom you speak is not involved with or connected to the situation explain your reasons for wanting to leave immediately and see if any accommodations can be made for example you may be allowed to work out a notice by working from home however if your work is not the type of thing you can do remotely such as if you work on an assembly line this may not be an option make sure this meeting will be kept confidential you don t want everyone knowing you re going to leave until you do so otherwise there might be some backlash search for example letters if you re unsure how to compose your letter you may be able to find samples online that will help guide you avoid copying a sample verbatim though it might not fit your situation 4 x research source try to find more than one sample read them carefully so you understand the substance well enough to make it your own you typically don t necessarily want your letter to sound to formal or canned however if you re delivering the letter to an abusive or problematic boss a canned letter may be appropriate use traditional business letter format as tempting as it may be to fire off an i quit email a traditional letter is a better way to go even though you re not giving any notice it shows that you respect your employer 5 x research source you typically can find a business letter template on any word processing application using that will make formatting your letter much easier if your employer has a dedicated human resources department create two identical letters one should be addressed to your boss the other to the head of human resources include your personal address on the letter along with any additional non company contact information such as your personal phone number or email address maintain a courteous tone regardless of your real feelings about your boss or your job experience courtesy makes a better impression being polite and professional will make it easier to accept your resignation 6 x research source 7 x research source state the exact date on which you want your employment to end don t say effective immediately or effective at the end of this week if you re writing the letter on september 14 and you expect your last day to be september 16 write i am writing to resign my position effective september 16 apologize for not being able to provide any notice and close your letter by thanking your employer for the opportunity keep it brief and to the point show your employer you respect their time don t go on a long rambling rant about your personal issues or your problems with the company simply state that you re resigning your position effective immediately and leave it at that 8 x research source 9 x research source keep in mind that this letter could come back to haunt you even if you already have another job lined up you shouldn t put it past your boss to send a copy of the letter to your new employer especially if you live and work in a relatively small town or work in a close knit industry if you re not comfortable disclosing the reason you need to resign you don t have to say anything specific remember that as an at will employee you can leave at any time for any reason at all or for no reason mention any issues regarding accrued time off or your last paycheck some employers require you to come in for an exit interview when you accept your final paycheck you should generally be open to follow any existing separation procedures unless doing so would be impossible for example if you have to travel far away immediately proofread your letter carefully when you ve finished your letter double and triple check it for spelling and grammatical errors you want your last impression to be a good one and typos or sloppy grammar won t do you any favors 10 x research source keep in mind that some people view the presence of typos as a sign of disrespect you re signaling that you don t think they re worth the effort to produce the best work after you ve proofread your letter print it off and sign it by hand make copies of your signed letters for your own records before you take them to your employer hand deliver your letter if at all possible you want to take the letter to your boss in person rather than mailing it mail does have the benefit of being able to later prove the letter was received however this benefit is outweighed by the difficulty of timing 11 x research source 12 x research source when you speak with your boss be as apologetic as possible it can help to acknowledge that you understand how your leaving may put them in a bind if you have a legitimate reason talk about the situation they may be able to help you more than they would if you said nothing if you have any questions about your employer s separation procedures now is the time to ask them depending on your position you may want to offer to help out in the coming weeks or be available by phone or email to answer questions reach out to coworkers or direct supervisors you worked with closely or with whom you had a strong rapport you want to thank them personally and let them know you enjoyed working with them so there are no hard feelings get a copy of your employee handbook most established employers especially larger corporations will have a written employee handbook however you may not have been given your own copy even if you do have your own copy it s likely you haven t looked at it since it was given to you when you first started your job if you don t have a copy talk to someone in human resources about getting one if you want to keep your plans a secret you don t have to tell them why you need it just say you want to check the benefits policy you also may be able to get a hold of an employee handbook on the sly if you know of a coworker who has a copy just ask to see theirs review your company s separation policy your employee handbook should have a section dealing with what happens when an employee voluntarily separates from the company these sections typically state that two weeks notice is required 13 x research source if the separation policy makes no mention of providing notice then you have nothing to worry about however this is rarely the case your employer typically will list consequences for quitting without sufficient notice a typical consequence is that you cannot expect a positive recommendation from the employer after you re gone often this means that future employers won t have the ability to verify any positive experience or education you ve acquired as a result of the job particularly if you re just starting in a career this can be a pretty devastating consequence find out what will happen with benefits whether you get money in your final paycheck for accrued leave may be tied to whether you provided notice if this is the case you may want to reconsider whether quitting your job without giving notice is worth it 14 x research source this may be particularly important if your employer allows you to accrue paid time off and you ve been working there for awhile keep in mind that in that case this amount may add up to hundreds if not thousands of dollars however if the reason you must leave without notice involves some emergency you may be able to make arrangements with your employer to get paid for at least part of this time make arrangements to return all company property if you were issued any company property such as a laptop or a mobile phone bring them with you on your last day find out what the procedures are for checking them back in 15 x research source some employers require all company property to be returned at a scheduled exit interview if your employer has this policy get a list from human resources of the property that was checked out in your name so you can make sure everything is returned if you have a parking pass or badge for building security your employer likely wants those back too check your belongings thoroughly before you leave on your final day and make sure you aren t inadvertently taking home company property such as office supplies or other materials consult an attorney you don t generally need an attorney to quit your job without giving notice there s no law against it however if you have unresolved issues with your employer you may need legal advice 16 x research source 17 x research source if you happened to be under an employment contract you are not an at will employee it is imperative that you find an experienced employment attorney who can analyze our contract and the penalties for breaking it do this before you quit in some circumstances you may feel as though you were forced to quit if your workplace was abusive or unsafe an employment attorney can help you assess your legal options you also may need legal assistance if something happens after you quit for example your employer might seek reimbursement for expenses that were covered while you were an employee this is most likely to happen if your employer paid for continuing education courses or something similar that has a future benefit have another job lined up if you re quitting your job without giving notice because you need to immediately start another job your decision likely will have few if any negative consequences however it s generally good form to make sure your new employer is aware that you are quitting without notice 18 x research source it s also important to keep in mind that if you quit without notice and without good cause you probably will not be eligible for unemployment benefits if you have to quit your job without giving notice because of a family or personal emergency this may not be possible however to the extent possible your best option is to seek other employment while you re still working once hired let them know you re available to start immediately some new jobs may not give you the time to work out a notice if you fear the job offer will be rescinded if you have to work out a notice you may have no choice in any event making sure your new employer knows that you are quitting your old job without giving notice can spare an unfortunate surprise if your former employer decides to share this information with your new employer you won t have to worry about negative consequences request a written reference letter getting a written reference letter from your immediate supervisor before your last day can cut through a lot of red tape this letter can be especially valuable depending on your employer s notice policy 19 x research source you also should keep in mind that someone s opinion might change when you leave you may create a vacuum that leaves your immediate supervisor and coworkers scrambling in light of increased stress and an expanded workload they may not be as generous in describing your time working with them keep in mind that providing a written reference is no guarantee that a new employer won t call your old job however it can lessen their motivation to do so refrain from lying on job applications if you re filling out a standard application for a job it likely will require information about how you left your job often you must specify whether you provided notice 20 x research source 21 x research source as tempting as it may be don t check the box indicating that you gave notice if you didn t a potential employer can easily find out this information by calling your own employer and may do so even if you state that you prefer they aren t contacted despite answering no when asked if a former employer can be contacted a prospective employer still may call to verify that the information you provided was correct aside from that telling a prospective employer that they can t contact a former employer is typically a bad idea it sends up red flags by signaling to the prospective employer that you left on bad terms be prepared to explain your decision when you leave a job without notice it may come up in future interviews employers often look at employees who quit without notice as people who didn t respect their employer 22 x research source particularly if you have another job lined up when you quit leaving this employer without giving notice may not make any difference however be aware that there are some managers who are sticklers about this sort of thing they may have seemingly arbitrary rules such as never hiring someone who has quit a job without notice this isn t something you can predict or control if you have a legitimate explanation for why you quit without giving notice share it with prospective employers if your former employer understood and didn t fault you for leaving sharing their response to your resignation will look even better,Work-World
how to resign gracefully,it s time for you to make a change be it a new career path or simply a new challenge the procedure for resigning is simple enough give notice preferably in advance but if you don t want to burn any bridges and create obstacles to future opportunities you must be especially careful and considerate resigning is easy but resigning gracefully is not luckily with a few simple strategies you can make your resignation as smooth and as grudge free as possible,try to leave on a high note most people hand in their resignation when they are burnt out and feel like they can t work at their job anymore this burnt out feeling often inspires a lack of productivity while this is an understandable feeling you should do all you can to do the best work you can on your last project you may end up wanting a recommendation from your boss in the future or you may even work with them again it s best if you are remembered as a hard worker who gave it their all for the duration of their employment 1 x research source be aware of any types of benefits you may be eligible for if you are about to be laid off you may have a severance package or the option to collect unemployment benefits these can be very handy if you have not secured a new job resigning from a position may disqualify you from receiving anything it may be better in some cases to receive these benefits while looking for your next position make sure you learn the basic rules pertaining to retirement accounts like a 401k if applicable to avoid paying a tax bill plan to give notice if you want to leave under the best possible terms don t leave your employer high and dry scrambling to cover your position give at least 2 weeks notice or the minimum notice specified in your employment contract if applicable so that your boss can prepare to have others cover for you or have time to groom a replacement 2 x research source even if your contract doesn t specify a notice timeline you want to shoot for 2 3 weeks as a courtesy to your employer fewer than 2 weeks and your employer probably doesn t have an adequate replacement more than 3 weeks and your employer will be wondering why you re still around keep it to yourself once you ve made the decision don t go blabbing it all over company hill until word gets to your immediate supervisor think ahead like a general and know that knowledge is power give your boss or supervisor time to absorb and process the information if the company makes an attractive counter offer it will be awkward if you have already announced your plans to coworkers find out how your departure should be communicated to the rest of the staff once you have spoken with your boss you boss may send out a company wide email or they may ask you to send out your own personal notice do not mention your departure to anyone before you have discussed these details with your boss tie up any loose ends you may have this is both a respectful and considerate thing to do and your boss and your coworkers are sure to appreciate it finish up projects that you have and prepare guidelines for the person who will fill your position consider creating a file that explains where you left off on any long running projects and other essentials your replacement might need to know about things you worked on make sure all of your files are in order labeled and easily located you don t want to have frantic coworkers calling you after you have left the company because they can t find one of your files 3 x research source this is especially important if you are working on a team once you have given your 2 weeks notice discuss with your team which individuals will take on which duties until a replacement is found for you know what not to write in a resignation letter you don t need to include personal information such as your reason for leaving if it is something like a divorce or career change never write anything rude derogatory or simply mean you may need to be in contact with your boss later you may even end up working with them again so it is better to be respectful in your letter otherwise your terse ugly and childish words may come back to haunt you 4 x research source example of what not to write mr anderson i quit i hated working here you are stupid you also owe me 3 000 in vacation and sick days bob write a well written resignation letter there are quite a few details that can separate good letters from great letters in your letter follow the guidelines listed below a standard letter of resignation would read something like this dear mr spacely it has been my honor to work for spacely sprockets inc this letter is to notify you that i will be leaving to accept a new position with another company as of a date which is at least 2 weeks from the date of your conversation and letter please accept my thanks for our association and best regards to you and the entire company for the future sincerely george jetson be friendly and respectful if you were on a first name basis with your boss address the letter as such there is no need to sound stiff if you and your boss called each other by your given names plus using their first name adds a friendly touch to the letter that may lessen a bit of the sting show how much you appreciated working there even if you hated every second of your job try to find something complimentary to say something along the lines of i feel like i have learned a great deal about the art gallery world is complimentary even if you really mean i have learned a lot about the art gallery world and i am never ever going to be a part of it again reflect upon your achievements do not boast but do mention a few of the projects you worked on and how proud of them you are this is important to do because your letter of resignation will be filed away along with any negative remarks the higher ups may add to your file putting your achievements down will help you if you ever apply to a job that runs through the same hr department as your file will be accessed and your accomplishments will be one of the first things noted end on a warm note mention how you are grateful that you had the opportunity to work at this company and that you genuinely appreciate the people who work there including your boss you may want to add any names of people who you appreciate in particular for instance you could add i would never have been able to pursue my dream of becoming a prolific author without the insight i gained into the publishing industry by working at this wonderful company thank you for all your guidance with kind regards madeline miller have a copy of your letter of resignation in hand when you got to speak to your boss you should not email your letter as that is considered very unprofessional print it out and hand it to your boss when you meet with them to discuss your resignation ask your boss for a meeting to discuss an important matter poking your head in and asking for a moment of their time will do just be respectful of the fact that your supervisor has a job to do and may not be able to drop everything at the precise moment you are prepared to spring this news on them another option is to ask your boss if they will have time for a meeting the next day doing this gives them a chance to clear a bit of designated time to focus on your news if there is too much going on you will only add to their hassles so if it s at all possible wait for a time when your boss will have a few moments to focus on your news be prepared direct and polite rehearsing privately will help you be ready when your supervisor has you in to talk most managers are extremely busy and they will appreciate your direct approach forgoing the temptation to cushion the blow find the right way to say this or otherwise beat around the bush you might say something like i ve been considering my options here for some time and i ve decided it s time for me to move on i am grateful for the opportunities i ve found here but i must give my two weeks notice or i need to let you know that i have been offered a new position at another company i have really enjoyed working here but i need to give you my two weeks notice as of today my last day of work will be whatever two weeks from then is is this reasonable be prepared to discuss your reasons for leaving chances are you ve been working with this boss for some time and whatever your reasons are for leaving they may have some questions prepare a response that is concise and understandable 5 x research source if you are quitting because you hate your job try to frame your answers in an inoffensive way instead of i hate working here you might say i think its time that i head in a different direction with my career consider the possibility of a counter offer your boss may value you much more than you realized and make a counteroffer being polite and dignified about your resignation could make this possible you will need to consider in advance whether you would stay for a pay raise increased benefits a promotion or other incentives your meeting with your boss would be a prime negotiating opportunity so be prepared for it and know your own bottom line if staying is an option what would make you open to it however keep in mind that counter offers can have some serious downsides if you are given a counteroffer be sure to request for any counteroffer to be put in writing and signed those signatures would preferably be your boss supervisor and human resources when considering a counteroffer honestly evaluate why you want to leave and protect yourself while a raise might be nice it might not solve other issues that require either a promotion if your job advancement has stalled or a transfer to another group if you have personality conflicts with your boss emphasize the positive be honest but polite if the boss asks you if they had anything to do with your decision and they were a factor it s best to rely on tact and diplomacy to make an honest answer palatable in other words you won t help yourself by saying yes you re a lousy supervisor and i or anyone would have been way better off without you even if that s true you can be truthful without being cruel try saying something like i ve gotten an opportunity that will be a better fit for me in order to keep the terms about you rather than the environment or colleagues you re leaving think about the future remember the object of resigning gracefully is to always put yourself in a good position with the people you forged a relationship with while at work if you blow off everyone at your soon to be former workplace they probably won t write you a very nice letter of recommendation or perhaps not tell you about that sales job that they heard about through a friend being tactful courteous and smart about your departure will ensure that you ve given yourself the best possible shot at success in the future be aware that some bosses don t take kindly to you being the decider be sure you can truly afford to walk away from your job that day because sometimes the supervisor takes it very personally that you are leaving tell you there s no need to give notice and instruct you to leave immediately you will be the best judge of this so do your best to assess if your boss is one of these people but be aware sometimes you just can t predict what anyone will do re read your employment contract you must be aware of all the company s and your own termination options if there is no formal employment contract familiarize yourself with the default provisions of your state provincial law shake hands smile and thank your boss whether your departure is to relocate to take a better job or just to get away from a colleague you dislike show some class when you re walking out the door shake hands thank your soon to be former supervisor yay for everything and leave give notice to everyone else affected by your departure after informing your supervisor ask them if they will announce your departure if not be sure to personally tell other managers or key employees with whom you have worked that you have resigned say it in a way that thanks the person for helping you develop your career for example i don t know if you ve heard but i am resigning to take a position at another company before i leave i wanted to be sure to let you know how much i ve enjoyed working with you these people may leave for other jobs in the future and you want them to have positive memories of you

how to give notice at work,you may be nervous about giving notice at work even if you know you ve made the right decision to leave whether you re leaving for a new job in which case a congratulations is in order or your circumstances have changed the most important part of giving notice lies in making a graceful exit to give notice you need to be direct with your boss show your gratitude toward your company and avoid burning any bridges on your way out,tell your boss before anyone else one of the most important aspects of giving notice is making sure that your boss doesn t say i know when you finally give your notice though you may be dying to announce your new job or your intention to leave to your fifty closest co workers you should keep it to yourself and your family until your boss knows the score you should do this out of respect for your boss and for the sake of professionalism don t talk about it on social media either make sure your boss and co workers know before the world at large does do it in person unless you and your boss live on opposite parts of the country you should do your boss the service of meeting in person to discuss the fact that you re leaving the company even if you re not very close with your boss or you have some animosity toward him or her you should make the effort to have an in person conversation instead of sending a letter or an email this sends the message that you take your work seriously and want to take the time and effort to leave on a good note if your boss lives somewhere else then a phone call is preferable to an email or letter consider what you would do if you got a counter offer you may be surprised by how quickly your boss may give you a counteroffer to get you to stay now if your major complaint about your job is the lack of proper compensation then this really could be a strong incentive to stay if this is the case then you should ask yourself what number you have in mind that would make you stay it s

any important paperwork from the office in the event that you are asked to leave immediately though this doesn t happen very often it is possible if your boss gets angry or emotional be prepared for it just in case so you know what to do next consider what you d do if you re asked to stay longer it s possible that your boss will ask you to stay an extra week or two to help the company get its footing if you re flexible with the start date of your new job and really care about the company doing well in your absence then you should ask yourself if you re prepared to do this in advance if you re absolutely committed to having some time off between jobs to get your head together then make sure you have a firm idea of this before you talk to your boss after all you re leaving and your boss can t really force you to stay unless there is something that absolutely can t be done without you give notice when you talk to your boss the most important thing is to keep it short and sweet simply say that you re leaving the job state when your last day will be and thank him or her for the opportunity your boss will ask more questions and you can reveal a bit more but you shouldn t feel

breaths if you feel yourself losing your cool 6 x research source if you and your boss have developed a close relationship then it s natural that you ll feel some sadness however it s important to keep your cool as much as you can so that you make your plan clearly and can t be dissuaded keep things positive instead of ranting though you may feel the need to tell your boss the ten worst qualities she possesses or to detail every single thing you absolutely hate about your job you should avoid those kinds of thoughts they are completely unproductive and will only make your boss angry

don t bad mouth the job to your former colleagues you may feel a surge of relief about finally getting out of your job but that doesn t mean your colleagues feel the same way about the position you

office or your location is close a phone call will do if you are not in close proximity for example if you would have to drive over 4 hours or fly to speak to your supervisor when requesting a meeting you do not need to say why all you have to say is can i have a little of your time today to discuss something thank them for taking the time to meet with you since the meeting was by your request you

procedures are not explained to you you should ask for example so what are the next steps or are there any special procedures i need to follow from now until my last day some important information to obtain includes if there will be an exit interview an exit interview allows an employee who is leaving to provide the company with constructive criticism and other feedback what the procedure is to return company property phone car laptop tablet etc what paperwork if any is needed to be signed submit your signed resignation letter nearing the completion of the meeting hand over a signed resignation letter the letter must include the details described above which you should have also verbally expressed this letter will be kept in your personnel file refrain from lying you must remain

avoid sounding arrogant don t gloat over your new position or life choice if you are excited about the next steps in your life or professional career it is natural to want to discuss with others however during your meeting and before your last day it is important to keep your expression of these feelings low key if you constantly talk about it you may produce negative feelings surrounding your departure such as resentment or anger remain courteous no matter what the circumstances are it is imperative to remain as courteous and respectful as possible from the time you have decided to

name would agree this work relationship is not working out offer constructive criticism you may provide constructive criticism during an exit interview if your company does not conduct exit interviews you can ask your manager or human resources if you can provide suggestions on how to improve the company if they decline do not insist if the company does want to hear your suggestions provide valuable suggestions or constructive criticism so that the company can retain its other employees for example if you left because of harassment you can say it would be good for the employees if the company provided additional harassment training do not brag about your new role if you are leaving and already have a new job it is ok to disclose the name of the new company and your new title

manager for the opportunity this will leave a good lasting impression have a signed resignation letter prepared your letter should state the basic details of your resignation present your resignation letter at the end of your meeting this letter will be kept in your file and should include a sentence telling the company you are leaving your last date of employment a thank you for the opportunity

new environment for example if you ve just moved from a big city to a small town you ll find that the pace of life and what people are about are much different sometimes it can even seem like the people in your new place speak a completely different language even if it s the same as your own this can require learning a new lingo new abbreviations and new little quirks of language be prepared to make mistakes and ask for clarification maintain contact with your old life just because you have a new life that you re learning to live doesn t mean you should completely cut off the old one at

it won t last forever 4 x research source don t be dependent on other people for validation and support give yourself time it takes time to adjust to anything and that includes moving you will find

is usually called the honeymoon phase it s when everything seems so new and exciting and different also scary sometimes this typically lasts about three months following the honeymoon stage is the negotiation stage when you start to really see the differences between your new place and your old home this is often when feelings of uncertainty loneliness and homesickness start to intrude while this usually follows after the honeymoon phase sometimes you start right into this one the next stage tends to be the adjustment phase which happens after about six to twelve months in your new place this is when you ve developed your new routines and you re feeling a bit more at home typically it takes until a year after the move to reach the mastery phase when you feel more comfortable in your new home sometimes however it can take even longer remember each person is different take it one day or one moment at a time no matter what the major change is illness death of a family member leaving a job or a marriage you won t be able to deal with it if you try to take on too much the more you re looking ahead the less you re focusing on the here and now and the more it is going to hurt 5 x research source for example if you ve lost your job or left it avoid trying to deal with the big picture all at once you ll end up overwhelmed and at sea instead take each moment as it comes use one

people who have had an intense life change or already have one of these issues can find themselves getting depressed or anxious or having those issues get worse care for yourself one thing that a lot of people tend to forget is to take care of themselves and make themselves feel safe this needs to be a deeply intimate sort of caring that really allows you to relax and to just be wrapped in care like being wrapped in a big warm blanket 6 x research source you ll know what works best for you but some suggestions are making yourself a cup of tea and focusing on drinking it breathe in the steam feel the warmth slide down your throat and pool in your belly wrap yourself in a warm blankets or use a heating pad do some yoga and focus only on your breathing and the movement of your body if you find negative or upsetting thoughts intruding on your moment acknowledge them and let them go tell yourself that you ll deal with those thoughts later but right now what you need to focus on is finding comfort for yourself allow yourself to feel no matter what kind of change it is it is going to be fraught with emotions if you ignore these emotions and try to avoid them they ll only return stronger and more painful later one this doesn t mean you need to wallow in grief and anger but it does mean that you need to allow yourself to be angry to grieve 7 x research source you ll tend to cycle through emotions like denial anger sadness and acceptance each time you deal with them will make them pass more quickly the next time don t turn to painkillers this can mean something like drugs or alcohol but it can also mean watching t v excessively over eating not to enjoy food but because it helps numb some part of you or even diving into a romantic relationship these painkillers help you to numb out instead of dealing with your feelings take time to reflect on the change changes means different things to different people even to the same person at different times in their life reflecting on your feelings reflecting on what has changed and why can give you a handle on processing the emotional turbulence that comes with change journaling is another great way to reflect on the change not only does it help you to get your feelings out it also chronicles your journey through the change when another change comes you can look back on how you handled the previous one and what you felt and how you sorted through things find someone to talk to talking things out with someone can not only be greatly comforting but it can also lead you to insights about the change and yourself

you re handling the change is normal that your feelings are legitimate they can also offer insight and help keep you on track for healing support groups and religious organizations are great especially for people dealing with illnesses with the death of a loved one and that sort of life change this is a good place to find someone who has already undergone what you re going through and who can help guide you dream for the future although you don t want to obsess about the future or spend too much time worrying about it you do want things to look forward to this means deciding what you want your future to look like and working to create it daydreams are a great tool to try out imaginary scenarios to see what it is you want to do let your mind roam free to see how you want to make the most of this major life change collect ideas you like from the internet or in magazines you can look at potential housing ideas job ideas and plan how you might incorporate these into your own life make small improvements it s easiest to work in small steps taking on too much at once can completely overwhelm you what you want to do as you re working to adjust is to make your life just a little better just a little easier small adjustments can be things like eating better especially if you re dealing with an illness exercising to help raise the happy making chemicals and to get you healthier making better use of your time making plans and following through with them making sure you get more out of a day incorporate relaxation techniques into your life relaxation techniques like

incorporate meditation into its form the focus on breathing but it s a great way to get exercise to move your body and work out any kinks in your muscles or back understand that there are and will always be changes life is really about changes it doesn t matter how prepared you are there will always be changes that take you by surprise if you try to rigidly hang out to your current life and way of doing things you will find it harder to adjust to change in the long run again this doesn t mean denying your feelings about changes because change can be scary and overwhelming but it does mean that you accept these feelings as part of the change adjust to a new relationship the beginning to a relationship can be full of heady excitement it s important to keep your head however if you want the relationship to go anywhere move slowly you don t want to jump right in to moving in together to planning your future together when you ve only just started seeing one another if you find yourself giddily deciding on your children s names only a few months into the relationship take a step back and remind yourself to stay in the moment instead of jumping ahead avoid getting clingy it s natural that you re going to want to spend all your time with this new lovely person but it s not healthy don t constantly call and text and hang out with this other person not only will this keep the relationship charged but you won t tire of one another so quickly maintain your own lives keep up with your friends your work and your own habits of course you should do things together but make time for doing things separately that way you ll still have lots to talk about and you won t be overwhelming one another with attention deal with a change in a relationship it s inevitable that relationships change there s nothing you can do about that but you can cope with the change this could be anything from your partner suddenly becoming messy when they used to be neat or your spouse deciding that they don t want children even though they used to 9 x research source address problems as soon as possible especially if they are small ones that could become big ones later on for example if your partner has become messy and doesn t clean up after themselves talk to them and use i statements say i feel like i end up cleaning up all the dishes despite not having used any of them or it s really frustrating for me when i end up having to put all your clothes away one key part of adjusting to the change is by reaching compromise or accepting the difference this might mean going with your partner s feelings on this issue but your feelings on the next issue or it might mean meeting somewhere in the middle discuss how the change impacts your relationship and determine how important the issue is to your relationship if you want children and your partner does not this could mean either you decide that it s okay if you don t have children or it could mean that the relationship needs to end and the two of you part ways maintain your relationship long distance this can be incredibly challenging for people but it s easier now than it used to be it can take time and effort to adjust to a long distance relationship and you need to be prepared to invest time into it communicate with one another this is the biggest problem that arises in long distance relationships make sure that you talk over the things that are important to you the problems that come up in the relationship and in your life and what matters to you deal with doubts you re going to feel fear about what the other person is up to sometimes you re not going to trust them sometimes you re going to doubt them the best thing you can do unless you ve got evidence that something kinky is going on is to talk about your frustration about the long distance or complain to a friend about your doubts this helps get them out in the open where they are less poisonous spend time together make sure that you re making time for one another send each other funny postcards and letters along with talking on the phone and over the internet make specific dates and work towards getting to see one another in person adjust to moving in with one another this can be a big change in a relationship and therefore needs to be treated with caution you should feel comfortable pretty quickly despite inevitable road bumps also keep in mind that you will change your mind about moving in usually a couple days after you ve done so because the change is scary 10 x research source one key thing to being comfortable together is that you don t hide the un sexy and necessary things like tampons and pads or that pair of really atrocious underwear you have your significant other is going to find them anyway and the more you re open about those kinds of things the more comfortable you re both going to be routines are going to change that s simply something you re going to have to be prepared for you re going to have to figure out things like who does which chores around the house where both your things are going to go and so on it ll be a lot of negotiation and change give one another space part of adjusting to moving in together is to give each other space to deal with the emotions and feelings that are going to arise from this change deal with a breakup first off you re going to need time to grieve the end of the relationship even if you were the one to break it off break ups are hard on both parties and take time to move on from there are a few major things you should do if you re looking to adjust to your new single status take space from the other person this means deleting them on facebook or at least blocking their posts deleting them out of your phone staying away from their favorite haunts the more you re talking to them the more you re going to feel caught by them find yourself if you ve been in a relationship especially for a while you start to lose your individual sense of identity and become part of a twosome when the breakup happens it s time to figure out who you are without them do fun things go out and try new things this will keep your mind off them and will help you meet new people be careful about rebound relationships you really don t want to jump immediately from one relationship to another without taking time to fully process and grieve the end of the first relationship getting entangled with a new person right away is a surefire way to hurt both you and the new person,Work-World

how to move on after a life changing revelation,you re going along in life with few cares or worries and suddenly it hits you something someone says a glance in the right direction at the right time an overheard snippet of conversation and everything seems different now you realize something you know something you didn t know before how do you regain your balance and continue with your life sometimes you can t go back to the way things were before but you can go forward,take the time to take it in maybe you ve had a personal revelation about your own life maybe something was revealed about a friend or maybe you ve just been considering life in general and suddenly see everything in a different light this can be a result of a religious epiphany when you suddenly realize what you truly believe or because of a revelation of character your own or a relative s or friend s or because something about a situation that never sat right with you suddenly clicked into place whatever it is you need time to process and truly appreciate and understand which areas of your life must change from this time forward don t make sudden changes give yourself time to really consider this revelation from many angles before taking any action decide whether this changes things only for you or if it will change a relationship s when you are the only one to consider you will have a bit more leeway in implementing changes if your revelation involves another person or persons you will need to consider their rights your obligations to them and their feelings change may come in many forms but not all changes need to be steamrolled out over all those around you seek guidance and counsel you don t necessarily have to see a shrink or a therapist you could go to a trusted family member or friend and discuss your revelation it is never recommended that you act solely on your own instincts unless there is some intensely compelling reason it is always preferred and wiser to seek the input of a trusted friend or relative before taking action that will affect your whole life seriously meditate on all possible consequences of your actions after you have spoken to your advisors or counselors take the time to play out several scenarios in your mind before you do anything drastic will you lose your job will your relationship end what will happen if you do plan a what about plan b simply out of courtesy to others it should be said that the option that creates the narrowest swath of destruction is generally best however if your revelation is one such as outing a molester in your family in this case you cannot allow consideration of who will be hurt or upset to enter into your thinking ask yourself what payoff you are looking for especially if your actions will create a sensation or a big blowup will your life be better for it in the end what do you hope will happen when you stage your big reveal what if it doesn t happen then how will you feel sometimes we realize something and it hurts our feelings or conversely it makes us feel huge and invincible if you call all your loved ones together and make a big explosive announcement what are you hoping they will do perhaps your revelation is a personal one you are gay if your family lives in an area where tolerance is the general rule and you will be reasonably safe if it doesn t go well then telling them all together this way may pay off in the end given enough time usually families come around to this news surprisingly well and quickly but if you are in the bible belt and you spring this on your entire family at one big gathering you may be putting yourself at risk consider carefully what you would hope to accomplish with a big announcement and instead consider smaller more personal conversations with one or two family members or friends at a time take a deep breath and do it living with newfound knowledge can be a struggle whether you realize that you are gay or discover that you are adopted or your spouse is cheating or you found out that a family friend molested your sister or understand that your mother favors your brother over you these things can change your life maybe you just realized that you want to enter a monastery or maybe you realized that you want to enlist in the service instead of going to college right now whatever you have realized or discovered after a certain amount of time you have to act whether the action you take means that your life will change or that it won t you will decide to move forward from here one way or the other come out if you are gay or accept your friend who has just told you that s he is or end that relationship do it in the way that makes the most sense to you enter that convent or decide to do nothing about it at this time live your life on your terms the exception here would be if you know that by doing nothing someone else could be hurt in that case no matter what the consequences you must take action to prevent this from happening move forward don t relive this event or this revelation over and over trying to put your life back the way it was before all life is change you cannot hope to go backward not ever not from anything good or bad all you can do is put it into its proper perspective and go forward pining for what was is not productive accepting what is and moving ahead with your life is the better plan tell yourself one day i will come to terms with this that day can be today,Work-World

arrive at the same destination explore what your expectations were sometimes we get frustrated when things don t go according to plan because they don t meet our expectations think about the expectations you had for the situation think about if your expectations may have been too strict or rigid 4 x research source one plan or goal is not a measure of your worth just because things didn t work out this time that doesn t mean they will never work out in the future for example you and your friends wanted to go to a special restaurant and you find out it s closed you may be disappointed or upset because you were expecting a nice meal there instead of thinking that the only good meal is at this one restaurant evaluate the other places available restate your goal since your original plan hasn t come through return to your original mission or goal for the situation you likely had a brainstorming phases about your goals and expectations go back to that moment 5 x research source talk about your goal again with those involved consider writing down your original goal putting the situation in writing particularly for bigger plans can help to solidify what your goal is use this

writing down the other options available and making a list of pros and cons reassess the strategies and possible outcomes to your plans talk with others involved in the process friends family co

as it seems because you had too high expectations while this is all in hindsight it s important to see what happens next as a way to grow avoid giving up when something doesn t go the way you d like you may feel like you ve failed avoid seeing yourself with hate and instead focus on what you are thankful for resilience is key to keeping yourself motivated 11 x research source giving up means giving into your own self doubts reframe your negative thoughts by thinking about the good things that have happened even if they are small things for example if you were hoping to get an a on an exam

other exams maybe the other students all got cs on the exam too learn from mistakes life is trial and error some mistakes are our own and some are those of others or simply forces beyond our control own up to your mistakes but avoid dwelling in them when you are honest with yourself then you can learn to grow and become better mistakes are learning opportunities they can push you to the invisible boundaries of what s possible and what s not when you try new things it s possible you ll make mistakes this is part of life it can make you stronger and more prepared for the next time consider saying to yourself i know that i messed up but it s not the end of the world or i can learn from this i can be better i can be ready for the next time ask for help there s no shame in asking for input talk with people that you trust about what they think about the situation get advice from a variety of people 12 x research source seeking advice can help you feel less alone with your thoughts or concerns people on the outside might have a better vantage point about what s going on,Work-World

feelings come up be felt but always return to your breath breathe through each experience if you get sidetracked in your own thoughts always come back to your breath don t sabotage yourself by expecting meditation to come easily right away practicing mindfulness and meditation can be very difficult at first but becomes easier the more you do it stick with it even if you are initially

express those feelings 3 x research source say to yourself it s hard not being able to change something to an outcome i want discussing the situation with your friends can help you normalize your experience it can be very helpful to hear that your feelings are normal and they would feel similarly too consider what you actually need rather than what you desire it is easy to get very upset with relationships do not go as hoped but usually these are imperfections rather than dealbreakers a disagreement or argument typically is not as serious as abuse for example example you had a falling out with a friend and you need someone to apologize to you to feel at peace perhaps it feels like that is the only way to experience peace but does it have to have that outcome maybe you need to simply let go of the friendship and move on as irritating as it is you can experience peace even when you don t get what you want 4 x research source example your friend dies in a car accident of course there is no way around this loss however you accept in time that what has happened cannot be undone and your friend s love friendship and lessons will always be with you even if he or she is not you

it or believe it at first but that s okay recognize what s in and out of your control feeling in control of outcomes and the environment is associated with an increased sense of well being feeling out

accepted to medical school however you can control how you react to it and how much it affects how you feel for example you may feel sad upset and not smart enough yet does this define how intelligent or worthy you are choose to maintain your sense of self even when you don t get what you want look at the big picture while something may feel hugely impactful to you right now ask yourself how it will affect your future will it ultimately matter in five years are there positive things that can happen even if you didn t get what you wanted even if you feel disappointed now and don t know what to do it doesn t mean that other opportunities will not arrive for you that will benefit you 7 x research source think about what other opportunities may be available for you maybe you didn t get your dream job but you may find a similar opportunity or you may decide to pursue a different direction in your career consider too past disappointments did you eventually get over them did they impact your life irreparably or were you able to move forward and let them go this can help you gain perspective accept change part of letting go is accepting change if you were set on one particular outcome letting go can be more difficult accepting change means moving out of living in the past and accepting your new present and future change is almost always uncomfortable at first especially if you re not the one making the changes once you move past the discomfort consider moving into a place of accepting your circumstances 8 x research source for example if you wanted to buy a house but your

you have excellent support from friends who love you and help you through the hard times forgive if you need to forgive someone in order to move forward do so perhaps you resent your parents for not being there for you as a child or are bitter about a recent divorce if other people have hurt you and you re struggling to let go because you still resent them consider how forgiveness may help you accept what you cannot change forgiving someone doesn t mean you excuse their behavior or forget what happened forgiveness is about releasing yourself from the pain someone else has caused you 10 x research source for example to a parent you can write or say you did your best but i needed more from you when i was a child now that i m an adult i can meet my own needs and forgive you for not being

if you re moving to a new country across your country from the town to the city and vice versa places are simply different and you have to be prepared for that try to match your pace to that of your new environment for example if you ve just moved from a big city to a small town you ll find that the pace of life and what people are about are much different sometimes it can even seem like the people in your new place speak a completely different language even if it s the same as your own this can require learning a new lingo new abbreviations and new little quirks of language be prepared to make mistakes and ask for clarification maintain contact with your old life just because you have a new life that you re learning to live doesn t mean you should completely cut off the old one at first it might cause feelings of sadness nostalgia and regret but connections to your old life can also help bolster you in the new times use technology to keep in touch you live in an era when it is

it won t last forever 4 x research source don t be dependent on other people for validation and support give yourself time it takes time to adjust to anything and that includes moving you will find yourself feeling stressed and nostalgic and lonely at different times that s perfectly normal there s a timeline of getting acclimatized to your new space which can help the very first phase of moving is usually called the honeymoon phase it s when everything seems so new and exciting and different also scary sometimes this typically lasts about three months following the honeymoon stage is the negotiation stage when you start to really see the differences between your new place and your old home this is often when feelings of uncertainty loneliness and homesickness start to intrude while this usually follows after the honeymoon phase sometimes you start right into this one the next stage tends to be the adjustment phase which happens after about six to twelve months in your new place this is when you ve developed your new routines and you re feeling a bit more at home typically it takes until a year after the move to reach the mastery phase when you feel more comfortable in your new home sometimes however it can take even longer remember each person is different take it one day or one moment at a time no matter what the major change is illness death of a family member leaving a job or a marriage you won t be able to deal with it if you try to take on too much the more you re looking ahead the less you re focusing on the here and now and the more it is going to hurt 5 x

future is one of the signs of depression or anxiety disorders you will want to make sure that if you re unable to stay in the present because of overwhelming anxiety or depression that you seek help people who have had an intense life change or already have one of these issues can find themselves getting depressed or anxious or having those issues get worse care for yourself one thing that a lot of people tend to forget is to take care of themselves and make themselves feel safe this needs to be a deeply intimate sort of caring that really allows you to relax and to just be wrapped in care like being wrapped in a big warm blanket 6 x research source you ll know what works best for you but some suggestions are making yourself a cup of tea and focusing on drinking it breathe in the steam feel the warmth slide down your throat and pool in your belly wrap yourself in a warm blankets or use a heating pad do some yoga and focus only on your breathing and the movement of your body if you find negative or upsetting thoughts intruding on your moment acknowledge them and let them go tell yourself that you ll deal with those thoughts later but right now what you need to focus on is finding comfort for yourself allow yourself to feel no matter what kind of change it is it is going to be fraught with emotions if you ignore these emotions and try to avoid them they ll only return stronger and more painful later one this doesn t mean you need to wallow in grief and anger but it does mean that you need to allow yourself to be angry to grieve 7 x research source you ll tend to cycle through emotions like denial anger sadness and acceptance each time you deal with them will make them pass more quickly the next time don t turn to painkillers this can mean something like drugs or alcohol but it can also mean watching t v excessively over eating not to enjoy food but because it helps numb some part of you or even diving into a romantic relationship these painkillers help you to numb out instead of dealing with your feelings take time to reflect on the change changes means different things to different people even to the same person at different times in their life reflecting on your feelings reflecting on what has changed and why can give you a handle on processing the emotional turbulence that comes with change journaling is another great way to reflect on the change not only does it help you to get your feelings out it also chronicles your journey through the change when another change comes you can look back on how you handled the previous one and what you felt and how you sorted through things find someone to talk to talking things out with someone can not only be greatly comforting but it can also lead you to insights about the change and yourself that you might not otherwise have had try to find someone who has already been through what you re going through this person will be a sort of mentor to you someone who can help you see that the way you re handling the change is normal that your feelings are legitimate they can also offer insight and help keep you on track for healing support groups and religious organizations are great especially for people dealing with illnesses with the death of a loved one and that sort of life change this is a good place to find someone who has already undergone what you re going through and who can help guide you dream for the future although you don t want to obsess about the future or spend too much time worrying about it you do want things to look forward to this means deciding what you

of doing things you will find it harder to adjust to change in the long run again this doesn t mean denying your feelings about changes because change can be scary and overwhelming but it does mean that you accept these feelings as part of the change adjust to a new relationship the beginning to a relationship can be full of heady excitement it s important to keep your head however if you want the relationship to go anywhere move slowly you don t want to jump right in to moving in together to planning your future together when you ve only just started seeing one another if you find yourself giddily deciding on your children s names only a few months into the relationship take a step back and remind yourself to stay in the moment instead of jumping ahead avoid getting clingy it s natural that you re going to want to spend all your time with this new lovely person but it s not healthy don t constantly call and text and hang out with this other person not only will this keep the relationship charged but you won t tire of one another so quickly maintain your own lives keep up with your friends your work and your own habits of course you should do things together but make time for doing things separately that way you ll still have lots to talk about and you won t be overwhelming one another with attention deal with a change in a relationship it s inevitable that relationships change there s nothing you can do about that but you can cope with the change this could be anything from your partner suddenly becoming messy when they used to be neat or your spouse deciding that they don t want children even though they used to 9 x research source address problems as soon as possible especially if they are small ones that could become big ones later on for example if your partner has become messy and doesn t clean up after themselves talk to them and use i statements say i feel like i end up cleaning up all the dishes despite not having used any of them or it s really frustrating for me when i end up having to put all your clothes away one key part of adjusting to the change is by reaching compromise or accepting the difference this might mean going with your partner s feelings on this issue but your feelings on the next issue or it might mean meeting somewhere in the middle discuss how the change impacts your relationship and determine how important the issue is to your relationship if you want children and your partner does not this could mean either you decide that it s okay if you don t have children or it could mean that the relationship needs to end and the two of you part ways maintain your relationship long distance this can be incredibly challenging for people but it s easier now than it used to be it can take time and effort to adjust to a long distance relationship and you need to be prepared to invest time into it communicate with one another this is the biggest problem that arises in long distance relationships make sure that you talk over the things that are important to you the problems that come up in the relationship and in your life and what matters to you deal with doubts you re going to feel fear about what the other person is up to sometimes you re not going to trust them sometimes you re going to doubt them the best thing you can do unless you ve got evidence that something kinky is going on is to talk about your frustration about the long distance or complain to a friend about your doubts this helps get them out in the open where they are less poisonous spend time together make sure that you re making time for one another send each other funny postcards and letters along with talking on the phone and over the internet make specific dates and work towards getting to see one another in person adjust to moving in with one another this can be a big change in a relationship and therefore needs to be treated with caution you should feel comfortable pretty quickly despite inevitable road bumps also keep in mind that you will change your mind about moving in usually a couple days after you ve done so because the change is scary 10 x research source one key thing to being comfortable together is that you don t hide the un sexy and necessary things like tampons and pads or that pair of really atrocious underwear you have your significant other is going to find them anyway and the more you re open about those kinds of things the more comfortable you re both going to be routines are going to change that s simply something you re going to have to be prepared for you re going to have to figure out things like who does which chores around the house where both your things are going to go and so on it ll be a lot of negotiation and change give one another space part of adjusting to moving in together is to give each other space to deal with the emotions and feelings that are going to arise from this change deal with a breakup first off you re going to need time to grieve the end of the relationship even if you were the one to break it off break ups are hard on both parties and take time to move on from there are a few major things you should do if you re looking to adjust to your new single status take space from the other person this means deleting them on facebook or at least blocking their posts deleting them out of your phone staying away from their favorite haunts the more you re talking to them the more you re going to feel caught by them find yourself if you ve been in a relationship especially for a while you start to lose your individual sense of identity and become part of a twosome when the breakup happens it s time to figure out who you are without them do fun things go out and try new things this will keep your mind off them and will help you meet new people be careful about rebound relationships you really don t want to jump immediately from one relationship to another without taking time to fully process and grieve

how to deal with uncertainty,throughout our lives we are bound to have several encounters with uncertainty nobody likes to feel uncertain about a decision they have to make whether or not to believe in something or someone or how an event will work out uncertainty can cause a lot of disruption in our daily lives and may cause us to fixate on the uncertainty fortunately we can take steps to help deal with this uncertainty so that we can get through the day,plan what you can plan part of what makes uncertainty so scary is that we feel that we don t have any control over the situation this will depend on the specific uncertainty that is bothering you but if you can find something small that you can predict or plan then do so 1 x research source for example if it is uncertain whether or not you will be moving to a new country or whether you will be accepting a new job in your current country make plans for how you will enjoy either outcome if you end up staying you might join a new gym or find a new flat if you move to a new country look into the opportunities that expatriates have in that country to get together decrease the number of choices you have if your uncertainty is related to a decision you have to make then try to find ways to reduce the number of choices you have use things such as your values beliefs and ultimate life goals to help you reduce the choices if that is relevant for your decision for example if you are feeling uncertain about a few job offers you have received think about how each job will help you accomplish your career goals but also about how they will influence your quality of life if you have a very involved family life it may not be a good idea to choose a job that can call you away at any time of the day or night this can help you eliminate one or two of your choices based on consideration of what is important to you set realistic goals setting goals can be a great way to help prevent uncertainties in our life and when uncertainty does arise have goals can keep us from getting distracted by this uncertainty if you have something you want to achieve then set a goal to do so for example if you have a dream of attending a good college and becoming a doctor then make that your goal whatever your goal is write it down this helps make it more concrete some goals may be more difficult to achieve and may require more commitment but with enough time and discipline you can achieve almost anything on the other hand make sure you are realistic about your goal setting a goal to run a marathon in one month even though you ve never run in your life is not a realistic goal take things one step at a time if you have a very large goal you want to achieve it is best if you can break that big goal into smaller more manageable sub goals for example if your goal is to run a marathon and you haven t ever run before make a few smaller goals that you are certain you can achieve your first goal could be to run one mile without stopping then you could move up to running a 5k race once you ve accomplished that shoot for a 10k and so on allow for flexibility no matter how much we might want to achieve a particular goal there can be hindrances to achieving our goal therefore it is important to remain flexible when it comes to achieving a goal for example if you want to get into the best university in the country but realize that you won t be able to afford the costs of doing so try looking into some other options there are many many good universities that are more affordable than some of the ivy leagues on the other hand if you simply must go to that expensive ivy league consider attending part time this will give you enough time to also have a part time job obviously this won t cover everything but it will help put some money in your pocket and has the added bonus that you will have a bit of experience to put on your resume have a back up plan in some cases no matter how committed we are to reaching a goal life or circumstances will get in the way therefore it is always good to have a back up plan this will also help to prevent uncertainty when thinking about your goal because you know how you will deal with an outcome that is not the one you are aiming for for example if you have been training for your marathon and you re at the starting line on race day but feel worried and uncertain that you won t be able to finish then let your backup plan be that when you get to the half marathon mark you can stop if you feel that it is too much although this may be a slightly disappointing outcome you can then take stock of your training and have a better idea about what to expect next time then you ll definitely be able to finish understand that uncertainty is a part of life fortunately or unfortunately no matter what you do there will always be uncertainties in life the best thing you can do is remember that life would be really boring if we always knew what was going to happen for example if we knew when we were born who we would marry how many kids we have what kind of job we would do we would lose our sense of adventure and curiosity allow yourself some time to fixate when a level of uncertainty appears in your life we tend to let it take over our thoughts this includes questions about different outcomes and finding information about different outcomes could be helpful in allowing you to deal with the uncertainty therefore it is not a bad idea to give yourself some time to dive into whatever information you can get your hands on 2 x research source for example if you or someone you love has found out they may be suffering from a serious disease search the internet for all the information you can find talk to other people who have the disease this may result in some scary truths but it may also help calm your anxiety that is related to the uncertainty of the diagnosis accept that there are no shoulds in life if you are convinced that things will always work out how you want them or that things must be a certain way then you are bound to be disappointed instead remind yourself that no matter how things work out you will learn how to be happy if you can be open to the possibilities that lie in front of you 3 x research source for example if you are worried because you feel uncertain about whether or not you will get to go on a date with the person you like remember that there are many other people on the planet and just because you like someone doesn t mean they should like you back if it turns out they don t feel the same you will eventually meet other people you find interesting and they might feel the same reassure yourself that you are strong remind yourself that you can deal with whatever comes your way both mentally and emotionally if you aren t feeling confident remind yourself of a time when you overcame a really tough situation 4 x research source you could also do something to reassure yourself of your emotional strength you could for example do something that scares you like going to a social gathering where you don t know anyone and making a new friend distract yourself if nothing else works try giving yourself to an engaging activity if you have a job put in a few extra hours which will force you to focus on something else for awhile another good way to use your time is through volunteering you could try volunteering at an animal shelter which will give you a good way to focus on something else and will help a homeless animal as well you could also use a different activity to distract yourself for a few hours adult coloring books have become very popular recently and many claim that they are a good way to relax and get your mind off of the day s stress and worries reflect on past experiences think of a time where you previously experienced anxiety related to uncertainty how did you cope with the issue then did it work out in your favor or not reminding yourself that you ve been here before and made it through can be a comfort that uncertainty is not the worst thing in the world if your past experience did not work out how you wanted then it is more proof that no matter what happens you will find a way through it for example maybe you had to make a tough decision about which university to attend how did it work out for you were you sorry that you chose the university that you did most likely not if you felt that you had chosen the wrong one how did you deal with it do yoga or meditate stress related to uncertainty activates structures in the brain that can make it difficult to calm yourself if you are having trouble getting your mind settled try practicing yoga or try meditation 5 x research source you could attend a yoga class or simply find a relaxing yoga video on the internet meditating will not only help your brain focus on something different it will also improve your ability to deal with stressful and uncertain events in the future seek professional help if you find that you are experiencing anxiety regarding uncertainties in your life it may be useful to seek help from a mental health professional this will give you an outlet to an outside person who can help you manage your anxieties and fears objectively 6 x research source if you have a trusted friend you can also talk to them about your worries but if your anxiety over uncertainty is affecting you so greatly that you have trouble getting through daily life it is probably best to seek professional help work through the negative thoughts if you are feeling anxious about some uncertainty about your life then it is perhaps because one outcome is less desirable than another if this is the case try working through the worst case scenario plan how you will deal with the worst case scenario 7 x research source for example if you feel uncertain about your performance on a recent exam try to work through the different scenarios if you did very poorly on your exam how will it affect your grade will you be able to make up for the poor grade through extra credit or through the remaining assignments and tests you have left can you discuss the issue with your teach to see if there are other ways of improving this will help your brain to think more pro actively and positively write in a journal when we are worried about an uncertainty our mind tends to go in circles if you aren t comfortable talking about what is going on in your head then try writing it down either in a journal or just in a document on your computer this will help give your mind an outlet you don t have to do anything with this writing when you are done with it just simply give yourself a way to get everything you are thinking out of your brain pray if you believe in a higher entity pray to them for guidance and comfort remember that they will help guide you to the right path and all you have to do is listen for this guidance if you are religious praying can give you some comfort as it allows a way for your brain to talk through the issue with an entity that you trust in while it may not fix the problem entirely it can provide you with some comfort which may help you see other ways of dealing with your uncertainty,Work-World
how to prepare staff for management change,management change can be stressful for employees but it does not need to be disruptive whether the company s corporate leadership is changing or new managers and supervisors are being assigned to staff members it can take a little time to adjust to a new reporting structure or organizational shuffle prepare staff for management change by communicating openly offering to address their concerns and questions and having a procedure in place for the transition,map out the change process put together a timeline of action and communication so you can present an organized plan to staff include top leadership and new managers in the planning process discuss specific areas that will affect staff during the management change so you can be prepared for questions and suggestions identify the staff members who will be leaders and detractors every company has a few people who can be relied upon to help management keep morale high as well as a few people who can be counted on to complain develop a plan for each group have a manager talk to the staff leaders for insight on how to keep people positive about the change and assign someone to watch the detractors for excessive gossip or negativity develop a consistent message whether you are going to announce the change in person online through written communication channels or via separate managers and supervisors make sure everyone who has a part understands the change message and how to communicate it create talking points for anyone who will need help in explaining what the change means to staff and teams anticipate questions and concerns and help communicators address them share the news in a timely manner you do not want your staff to hear about management change through the grapevine or outside your company let your employees know about the change before you go public with the news explain the rationale for changing management tell staff why the management change is taking place explain the positive outcomes you expect from the change be positive and optimistic but do not mislead the staff if the company is struggling be honest about it introduce the new managers allow your staff to meet and get to know the new managers as soon as you announce the management change share the managers biographies resumes and professional interests encourage the new managers to get to know their teams and the rest of the staff invite opinions and feedback answer any questions that staff may have about the management change appoint specific people to answer questions and manage feedback let staff know who they should talk to if they have questions comments or ideas keep employees engaged during the transition after the initial announcement about the change continue to communicate as the process moves forward evaluate your success for future organizational change once the change is in place measure your outcomes and determine what worked well and what will have to be adjusted the next time share the success stories with staff use company publications email blasts or company meetings to celebrate what you are proud of after a management change has been implemented,Work-World
how to improve your change management skills,change management is a systematic method to transition individuals from a current mode of operation into a new one because change is so common in the business world today effective change management skills are necessary for a business to succeed change management skills include leadership development marketing and sales abilities and communication abilities also beneficial to an effective change management is knowing the psychological stages people go through in the midst of change as this will allow you to know if you have managed a successful transition or if you need to address additional problems,focus on your leadership ability first and foremost solid leadership skills are much more important during a transition rather than strict business procedures being a good leader will get people to believe and trust in what you re doing which in turn will allow you to begin your campaign for change to be an effective leader in the change management process you should set an example as head of your business others turn to you for direction in business needs behavior ethics and standards if others in your business are to change you need to set an example remove perks perks suggest division and thought processes typical in a hierarchy removing your perks shows that you re willing to level the playing field walk around and talk to people today s business leaders manage their employees better through face to face interactions and learning more about their problems on an individual basis be genuine to be a leader of change it is critical to be honest in your interactions with other people you don t have to open yourself up like a book but being a leader also doesn t mean you need to hide your emotions just let people get to know you doing so allows you to build trust and rapport have passion being a strong leader requires passion behind your vision for change without passion you will face frustration and lose the desire to continue forward leadership requires lots of energy so make sure you are passionate about what you are doing target every group within your business regarding your campaign for change explaining to each group why change is necessary for example the board of directors may be curious about the long term effects of the change or your employees may want to know how they will personally be affected by your proposed changes communicate with everyone who has been affected once the change occurs fill your employees in on what is happening it may help to set up a formal way of communicating with everyone by keeping everyone informed you reduce the chances of low productivity and low morale realize that no matter how much effort you invest into making the transition seamless you will experience at least some resistance the reason for this is that some people adjust to change at different rates to reduce your frustration it is helpful to know the six phases people undergo when change occurs anticipation this is the waiting phase where people don t know what to expect and wait for what the future has in store confrontation at this stage people begin to realize that change is imminent or in some cases already under way realization people enter phase 3 once change has occurred this is where the realization sinks in that things will always be different depression as well as realizing the change intellectually people are now realizing the change emotionally and are mourning the past acceptance now people are comprehending the change emotionally as well it is not uncommon for people to maintain some reservations about the change but at this phase little effort is made to fight the change benefits from the change are acknowledged but not always fully reassuring enlightenment people are now fully accepting of the change and often wonder how they ever managed under the old way understand that there is no way of predicting how long it will take to fully implement a change the reason for this is that people go through the above phases at different rates of speed one person may require three months to reach phase 6 while another a full year also people do not undergo these phases in a linear order but rather jump around for example an individual may go from 4 to 6 and back to 2,Work-World
how to develop an it change management program,change management program cmp more commonly known as change control process or change control management process is a formal process used to ensure that changes to a product or system are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner as defined by iso 20000 cmp should not be confused with organizational change management ocm which manages the impacts of new business processes including those stemming from system roll outs and it initiatives changes in organizational structure or cultural changes within an enterprise in short ocm manages the people side of change the purpose of the cmp is to ensure that the negative impact of changes to a company s information technology system is minimized by using a standardized process of governance some changes are not optional if for example the bar code standard is changing you must adapt if a tax withholding structure changes you must have a change nevertheless all changes of this kind are still subject to governance it must never be the case that ad hoc changes are made to the system or to procedures without some oversight this idea must originate with senior management and be passed down with no exceptions to everyone in the company without backing at the highest level the cmp is a useless waste of time and money with proper backing this program will save your company from some very costly errors,develop a request for change rfc this may originate from problem management where an issue or a series of related issues is identified and a mitigating change is necessary to prevent or minimize future effects the rfc may also originate as a result of a business decision that will require some modification add delete change to the supporting technology an rfc may also be necessary due to outside influences i e governmental regulations or changes made by business partners obtain business change acceptance the decision to make a change is typically a business decision where costs vs benefits are weighed even in situations where the change is strictly infrastructure oriented component or system failure the decision to spend money resides with the business not with the it department there are occasions when procedures are developed in advance to preauthorize changes such as emergency system maintenance but regardless of the timing of the authorization the decision still rests with the business management initiate the development project development of the change including testing is an it guided function in the event of an emergency change server is down those functions are typically predetermined when a new system is to be developed there is a collaborative effort between the business users and the it team the systems are designed by it the design is approved by the business partners users developed by it tested by a combination of it and the users and the final product is approved by both careful attention must be given to ancillary effects the new change may have on existing systems pass the change management gate the change advisory board cab reviews all changes before they can be put into production normally the cab will consist of a group of people with different perspectives backgrounds and areas of expertise their function is to review the change from a process and governance standpoint to assure that all foreseeable risks have been identified and mitigated and that compensatory techniques are in place for any elements of exposure things that could go wrong the development team and the change sponsor will present the change to the cab evaluation of risk will be the focus implementation strategies communication to affected stakeholders backup plans and post implementation monitoring are elements on which the cab is required to focus the cab is not responsible for determining if the change is appropriate that decision has already been made the cab is also not responsible for determining if the change is cost effective again that is strictly a business decision implement the change if the cab does not approve the change the reasons are listed this is always because certain risks have not been mitigated or communications have not been planned and the development team will be given time to fix those issues and reschedule a meeting before the cab if the change is approved the implementation is scheduled it is not normally the case that the cab is represented at implementation although it is possible that some members of the cab have expertise that is necessary during the implementation but they will not be present as official cab representatives but rather as subject matter experts sme how the change is implemented the checklist and steps are predefined and were presented to and approved by the cab the entire process must be thoroughly documented and the approved process must be precisely followed report the results either the change was implemented successfully with no issues the change was implemented with issues that were corrected during implementation the change was implemented with issues that were deemed acceptable issues arose that were unacceptable and the change was rolled back or in the worst case the change was implemented with unacceptable issues and could not be rolled back whatever the result that is documented and returned to the cab the cab is then responsible for distributing that information to the stakeholders and for storing and maintaining those results in the change management system that may either be an automated database or a paper filing system but the documents must be maintained for audit purposes link problem management to changes issues that arise should be compared to the cab documentation of changes so any unanticipated adverse effects of a change can be isolated it is often the case that undesirable effects of a change are not noticed immediately but are identified by the emergence of problems in ancillary systems for example the addition of several fields to a database might not have a direct negative effect on the users but could impact network performance that would be apparent to other users who are not directly involved with the modified system periodically audit the cmp at least once each year an audit of the cmp should be conducted to assure that all change documentation is maintained and available every change approval document should be examined to assure that the proper signatures are in place and that the results of the implementation are properly documented,Work-World
how to overcome resistance to change,perhaps you have recently taken a new managerial position and are looking to create some positive changes within the office or maybe you are just looking to create change in general in your workplace school or organization though some people may be onboard with your new plan others might demonstrate some resistance making it hard to do your job effectively however you can overcome this resistance if you work to address the issues that exist create a positive environment and enlist the talents and skills of others,communicate the need for change the first step that you should take in creating change in your organization is to communicate the need for it perhaps your office has high staff turnover or burnout maybe sales have been dropping for years perhaps you can t get people to attend the programs that you put on whatever the issue communicate this to your audience or staff so that they acknowledge that something is not working 1 x

have didn t appear overnight and nor will the effects of these changes but we have to try our best try to put a human face on the situation by sharing story that illustrates the need for change this may make it easier to get through to your audience or staff communicate early and effectively once you begin to implement changes within your office or organization communicate these changes to your team as soon as possible don t allow them to find out through others they should be hearing about any changes straight from you 2 x research source consider holding weekly staff meetings to update your staff on any changes if the information is sensitive or urgent send an email or call an emergency meeting be honest when asked any questions remember that lies can poison morale and trust present the pros and cons of the change talk to them about the potential good that can come from the changes do not be overly optimistic however it s important that you are real with them and explain to them the cons as well empower them to assist you in battling the cons 3 x research source for instance perhaps you are a coach and you are implementing a new workout routine that has been proven to help in performance however these routines might make practices longer be honest with your team about the reality of any changes to be made so that you can be more trustworthy address individual concerns should anyone on your team have a concern with the changes presented don t allow their disgruntlement to fester address it quickly and empathetically with them most of the time people s concerns are fixable so work to create solutions when possible 4 x research source for instance perhaps you have an employee who is concerned about being laid off if you know that this particular employee is not a risk and there will be no changes to the budget assure them that their position is safe as long as they continue to work hard make sure that everyone is aware of how they can contact you with their concerns you may have to repeat it several times also you may want to meet with people individually or in small groups as the changes happen this will help you to identify and address problems early on don t wait for people to come to you resolve conflicts quickly and effectively in addition to having some potential anger or frustration with you there might arise some conflict between your employees perhaps some of the changes made seem to benefit certain employees more than others address these concerns with them and seek solutions to the issues 5 x research source schedule a meeting to discuss these issues with your staff remind them of the necessity of the changes so that they can come to think of them with reason rather than emotion accept feedback though your changes might be good and might truly help improve your office there are kinks in every plan should one of your staff identify one of these kinks acknowledge their foresight and thoughtfulness and work to implement their feedback enlist them to help you on this project so they have more buy in in the process 6 x research source you may even consider an anonymous method for people to provide feedback such as a comment box or an anonymous survey they can complete online demonstrate passion during the process of creating change you might become tired or frustrated though it is important to be honest with your staff it is also important to model the way for them show them your passion and confidence in the new changes so that they feel enthusiastic about them as well refrain from making pessimistic or critical comments instead remain hopeful and excited for the future 7 x research source maintain a positive and supportive attitude in addition to your passion it is important that you encourage a positive environment in the workplace come in each morning on time and with a smile greet everyone you see warmly if someone has an innovative new idea support them rather than shutting them down encourage and incentivize your staff to work hard 8 x research source encourage good morale in the office by doing team builders and social outings with your staff develop confidence in your audience compliment your staff when they do well particularly in the midst of this change if you have added new responsibilities to any of their roles then consider paying for training related to this new job doing so will ensure that your staff feels competent in their ability to do their work well 9 x research source implement change in stages when putting any changes into place in your office consider doing so in stages people can be overwhelmed if everything changes at once but if you do so incrementally it can feel much more manageable and tolerable develop a multi staged plan over the course of a few months or even years 10 x research source ensure that workloads are equitable during this time be very mindful of the allocation of work within your organization perhaps you have shifted roles and responsibilities and now some have much more to do than others be mindful of this and make any changes necessary and possible ask your staff if they feel comfortable handling the work they ve been given 11 x research source make sure to acknowledge their concerns about their new job description then appeal to their sense of teamwork and your company s vision statement to encourage them to be flexible and adaptable you might find also that some staff are looking for more to work on enlist them to help address negativity at its source a workplace can become toxic quickly due to one person because misery loves company if you become aware that someone is gossiping or spreading negativity then address it right away by speaking with that person one on one this will help to prevent the negativity from spreading get at the issues others care about in working to create change be sure that you are doing so in a persuasive way appeal to people s emotion and logic when asking them to switch up how things are done for instance if you have recently taken over a restaurant that could potentially be shut down soon and are looking to change things appeal to your staff s need for a job as well as their desire for the establishment to have a good reputation and serve good food 12 x research source find out what issues your staff wishes to tackle you may also want to enlist their help to develop a mission statement and a set of values for people to stick to then when people express fear of change you can direct them to this mission statement and values set clear and realistic goals in working with your staff and planning for the future set clear and realistic goals if you made 100k in profit during the first quarter consider setting a goal of making 150k during the second after you implement the changes ask your staff for feedback on and assistance in achieving these goals 13 x research source avoid making outlandish goals or you might become discouraged when you don t achieve them be very specific with your goals so that you can make them more actionable have your staff set individual goals for themselves hold them accountable during this process hold your team accountable for their role in the work check in with them periodically and give them deadlines for assignments that are time sensitive 14 x research source you might consider setting up one on one meetings every so often make sure to provide employees with written feedback on their performance this will be a helpful resource for them to read over and use to improve their work structure your group to achieve its maximum potential perhaps you have some staff who are not being utilized as effectively or strategically as they could be have conversations with them to see where they think they fit in this change and if there are any other kinds of assignments they d like to be working on 15 x research source for instance perhaps one of your goals is to have a greater social media presence use those in your organization with experience or knowledge in this area talk about the problem sometimes the resistance to change is not occurring in others but within yourself perhaps you have found yourself in a situation where everyone else seems okay with the changes but you are not consider whether you may have inadvertently taken steps to sabotage the change such as by dragging your feet

how to move on after a life changing revelation,you re going along in life with few cares or worries and suddenly it hits you something someone says a glance in the right direction at the right time an overheard snippet of conversation and everything seems different now you realize something you know something you didn t know before how do you regain your balance and continue with your life sometimes you can t go back to the way things were before but you can go forward,take the time to take it in maybe you ve had a personal revelation about your own life maybe something was revealed about a friend or maybe you ve just been considering life in general and suddenly see everything in a different light this can be a result of a religious epiphany when you suddenly realize what you truly believe or because of a revelation of character your own or a relative s or friend s or because something about a situation that never sat right with you suddenly clicked into place whatever it is you need time to process and truly appreciate and understand which areas of your life must change from this time forward don t make sudden changes give yourself time to really consider this revelation from many angles before taking any action decide whether this changes things only for you or if it will change a relationship s when you are the only one to consider you will have a bit more leeway in implementing changes if your revelation involves another person or persons you will need to consider their rights your obligations to them and their feelings change may come in many forms but not all changes need to be steamrolled out over all those around you seek guidance and counsel you don t necessarily have to see a shrink or a therapist you could go to a trusted family member or friend and discuss your revelation it is never recommended that you act solely on your own instincts unless there is some intensely compelling reason it is always preferred and wiser to seek the input of a trusted friend or relative before taking action that will affect your whole life seriously meditate on all possible consequences of your actions after you have spoken to your advisors or counselors take the time to play out several scenarios in your mind before you do anything drastic will you lose your job will your relationship end what will happen if you do plan a what about plan b simply out of courtesy to others it should be said that the option that creates the narrowest swath of destruction is generally best however if your revelation is one such as outing a molester in your family in this case you cannot allow consideration of who will be hurt or upset to enter into your thinking ask yourself what payoff you are looking for especially if your actions will create a sensation or a big blowup will your life be better for it in the end what do you hope will happen when you stage your big reveal what if it doesn t happen then how will you feel sometimes we realize something and it hurts our feelings or conversely it makes us feel huge and invincible if you call all your loved ones together and make a big explosive announcement what are you hoping they will do perhaps your revelation is a personal one you are gay if your family lives in an area where tolerance is the general rule and you will be reasonably safe if it doesn t go well then telling them all together this way may pay off in the end given enough time usually families come around to this news surprisingly well and quickly but if you are in the bible belt and you spring this on your entire family at one big gathering you may be putting yourself at risk consider carefully what you would hope to accomplish with a big announcement and instead consider smaller more personal conversations with one or two family members or friends at a time take a deep breath and do it living with newfound knowledge can be a struggle whether you realize that you are gay or discover that you are adopted or your spouse is cheating or you found out that a family friend molested your sister or understand that your mother favors your brother over you these things can change your life maybe you just realized that you want to enter a monastery or maybe you realized that you want to enlist in the service instead of going to college right now whatever you have realized or discovered after a certain amount of time you have to act whether the action you take means that your life will change or that it won t you will decide to move forward from here one way or the other come out if you are gay or accept your friend who has just told you that s he is or end that relationship do it in the way that makes the most sense to you enter that convent or decide to do nothing about it at this time live your life on your terms the exception here would be if you know that by doing nothing someone else could be hurt in that case no matter what the consequences you must take action to prevent this from happening move forward don t relive this event or this revelation over and over trying to put your life back the way it was before all life is change you cannot hope to go backward not ever not from anything good or bad all you can do is put it into its proper perspective and go forward pining for what was is not productive accepting what is and moving ahead with your life is the better plan tell yourself one day i will come to terms with this that day can be today,Work-World

how to create conditions for change,are you frustrated with your group or an organization do you have the courage to change in order to become an advocate for systemic change in your setting consider becoming an advocate for change while not without risk a small group of people in common cause can often make big differences in the status quo,determine your institution s goals and objectives knowing your enemy is a key aspect of military strategy which applies well here the individual must determine what the goals of the institution are this assumes both stated and real goals an understanding of the goals helps focus individual action if some goals are mutually held well and good let that be a definable point of confluence when goals are not commonly held define clearly the goals and their differences and use this data as part of a plan to act the same applies for institutional process how the institution does things define this clearly painstakingly identify points of agreement and disagreement focus on individual priorities unless this analysis is carefully done and continually revised the individual flounders lacks focus and grasps at straws tremendous energy is wasted dissipated and the individual is left ineffective often frustrated and bitter and all for no apparent reason analyze your own personal goals and processes implied in the above strategy is a personal goals and processes definition what is the individual about what are the goals what does the individual believe in passionately what significantly what not at all how much ego tripping is involved how comfortable is the individual with self why relate to an institution at all why this institution how do the goals converge how do they grate investigate the theory of coterie early in encountering an institution identify like minded people who may become mutual supporters this need not take on the aspect of a conspiracy but it may conspiracy is a word with two latin roots meaning breathing together not a bad idea at all one example of the effectiveness of this strategy is bell kaufman s case in up the down staircase the teacher seeks to survive and affect a hostile new york city high school her one friend in the school supports her sends her silly notes encourages understands and cares for her kaufman seems only minimally aware that her effect on the friend is mutual support groups coteries can be two or more persons who share goals the support system which evolves may be formal or informal the effect can be personal support confrontation stroking and caring it can also be intellectual support challenging assumptions clarifying goals testing hypotheses and designing strategy the latter support system is the conspiracy model although be open to collaboration with others especially leadership it may have both the active intellectual attributes and the personal support mechanisms engage in risk assessment some situations can be diagnosed early as unworkable for some individuals the energy consumed in seeking to resolve the unresolvable is unreasonable personal and institutional growth comes from struggle and risk the resolution of the conflicts should be possible before mammoth commitment is made it is important as the individual considers affiliations with an institution to assess the risks involved what are the worst things that can happen to me what are the best things what are the implications of failure personally and professionally is the risk worth the taking there is no point in risking all for a soggy marshmallow significant influence upon institutions usually implies significant risk determining which are the significant risks and taking them is the essence of the art of the change making individual excellence is always worth the effort but may not be worth the cost develop strategies when a clear awareness of individual and institutional goals has been gained a specific strategy and set of strategies is possible the strategies depend upon goals possible ties within the institution and skills of the individual strategies need in flight correction mechanisms so that the strategy can respond to change as the need arises the strategy should have a reasonable margin of success and be clearly defined expand into a vacuum this strategy was developed and effected with brilliance by fred demara the great impostor he reasoned that the individual could succeed in the institution as long as the individual did not threaten anyone creative thrusts were always into uncharted territory and he always gave as wide credit as possible to everyone available he advised never to intimidate never to covet the job or prerogatives of others always to develop new and complementary modes demara of course developed a number of other strategies based upon his correct perception of institutional ineffectiveness many of these strategies reflected his own special talent and ethical system view the institution from the perspective of leadership institutional leaders have unique perspectives and problems as they see the institution and its function in order to understand their decisions and influence their perspective must be sought sometimes this new data brings about new and comforting understanding sometimes the data makes more clear institutional goals that are contrary to individual goals in either event the data is valuable for strategic reasons support the best efforts of fellow members in a spirit of sharing and concern for others offer the widest possible support to those who are seeking to meet goals compatible with your own collaborate whenever possible the positive value of the action benefits the individual the institution and the other folk involved support all criticism and recommendation for change be prepared to deal with questions and concerns from all conceivable perspectives as you move to change the institution consider carefully before hand reflect rather than defend document what you say from several points of view be anxious to evaluate to be evaluated when the individual initiates evaluation the individual can control the processes of evaluation if the individual is open to evaluation and scrutiny then others cannot force an evaluation according to criteria and process which would be skewed against the individual s interest shape evaluation to be

success you kind of have to expect it so if you re working with a negative attitude that s gotta change start working on positive thinking it can be quite the chore so just start with 15 minutes a day when a negative thought creeps up take the time to reframe it it won t come naturally at first but you ll get better at it for that 15 minutes my life is terrible becomes i m not happy with life right now and am going to do something about it work on this until you don t allow the negative thoughts at all it ll be so much easier to get out of bed and take action when your mind is ready and raring to go allow yourself the power newsflash happiness doesn t come from removing your problems there are impoverished hungry children in this world who smile and laugh every day there are people who are in similar situations to you who consider themselves lucky to be alive so allow yourself the power to make yourself happy to view yourself worthy of success allow yourself control over your life instead of pretending you re an innocent bystander take the reins you got this you re on this page so clearly you have some motivation to do something that s all you need and you have it you need to make the decision to do something when you do things will change they have to they can t not latch onto this motivation and let it fester let it grow until it explodes get power hungry things are about to happen find a passion you can work towards it s hard to turn your life around if you don t know what direction to face you know having a passion some goal or dream to strive for gives you a path to tread instead of foraging about for a needle in a haystack that may or may not be there so what s yours where would you like to be in six months a year do you see yourself living in the same town maybe a different job working on a new project or business in school significantly more fit there s no wrong answer here and you can have more than one too devise a plan of action with a clearer trajectory now it s time for a very loose plan of action to form come up with half a dozen things you can feasibly do to start down the path you see the future you on you don t have to start today you don t have to start tomorrow but you do have to know where you re going and what you want to do we ve sorted out the end goal going back to school losing weight quitting smoking etc now how do you get there that s what this is for what steps small ones big ones whatever can get the ball rolling so when the time comes when you re ready you ll know what the future has in store remove dead weight whether it s quitting smoking dumping your lame boyfriend or moving out of your mob running roommate s apartment it s gotta be done these things are holding you back they re facilitating this negative mindset and turning an obstacle into a veritable mountain to climb over it may be a pain in the rear end but you know you can do it dumping your toxic best friend sucks having to live on your own in a crappy studio sucks going through withdrawal sucks but they re all things that you re capable of and that you ll be better for in the end and quite frankly you probably know it things like quitting your job sort of fall into a different category in today s day and age you need money to survive but realistically you could quit and move in with someone temporarily if you absolutely had to you could spend your weekends looking for a new one no one said this was going to be pretty sometimes things have to get worse before they get better you have to be willing to put in the work find a mentor why because we all need someone who s been there for their advice for their shoulder for the heads up and if you think there s no one in your life who s hit rock bottom you re probably wrong part of being human is about fighting battles all you need to do is ask the odds of you knowing the sordid history of everyone in your circle is slim to none however what s more likely is that when you read the phrase find a mentor one or two names pop into your head generally this is a more natural process than anything if you have to ask someone to be your mentor they re probably not this is just a role that s fulfilled by someone who s been there done that and bought the t shirt you just need to take advantage of their presence in your life by opening up to them and asking for assistance when you need it quit being fake don t get offended we all are we all say yes to invitations we don t want to say yes to we all smile and nod when inside we re sending daggers with our eyes we all do things that society has told us are okay and left it at that no questions asked well start asking questions make it a point to say no thanks when you don t feel like it right now is about being selfish and improving you it s not an excuse to be rude it s an excuse to do what you want this will not hurt others feelings if you re just being yourself declining an offer with a no thanks i m not feeling up to it isn t offensive people may ask further questions but they don t need an explanation if you don t want to give one you re just doing you right now if they have a problem with it it s theirs to have exercise sleep well and eat right your mind and body are interconnected if your body feels good it s a lot easier for your mind to feel good the three tenets of having a body that s ready to take on the world exercising getting enough quality sleep and eating healthily if you don t have time for these make time you owe it to yourself as for exercise try to get in a session 3 or 4 times a week whether that s hitting up kickboxing class or going for a walk with your dog it s all good just get out there and stick with it skeptical as to how this matters research says exercise can actually make you happier 1 x research source get enough sleep your decision making skills hinge on it seriously 2 x research source when our bodies and minds are tired we don t have the energy to weigh out what s actually good for us need an example that late night chalupa you decided to eat was a good idea only when it comes to your life it actually matters so get in your 7 9 hours of sleep a night it affects the other 15 17 hours more than we d like to admit your diet can also affect your mood 3 x research source loading up on whole grains fruits and veggies and sticking to lean meats and low fat dairy can give you that edge that you were previously lacking motivate yourself little things can actually make the biggest of differences jumping out of bed in the morning instead of hitting the snooze button can make you feel much more energized despite logic to the contrary listening to uplifting music leaving yourself positive little notes rewarding yourself for strides made it all builds up and can keep you on track change your alarm to something awesome if you re anything like the rest of us you wake up in the morning and all you can think of is no starting out the day negatively can seriously hinder the rest of it so start out as positively as possible change your alarm to something that invigorates you whether it s the circle of life or the ride of the valkyries is up to you no can turn into hell yes easier than you thought develop a routine studies have shown that people who are successful and content generally have a routine they stick to the routine they stick to probably isn t staying in bed all day and consuming buckets of fried chicken sure but what s more important is that their routine allows them to conserve energy when you have a daily routine going onto autopilot allows you to expend mental focus on deflating and getting rid of problems that arise you can only make so many decisions in a day and this routine allows you to save energy for the important stuff 4 x research source your routine should involve those three things mentioned above eating exercising and sleeping right and whatever else makes you happy a little bit of work a little bit of play and some self improvement time whatever form that takes meditation job searching going back to school etc make your most important decisions on anything in the morning why you are less likely to be emotionally and physically exhausted decision fatigue is definitely a thing like that poorly thought out late night chalupa at night we ve done so much work all day we throw caution to the wind and let our present selves make poor decisions for our future selves don t do it so if something big presents itself sleep on it you want as much energy as possible to decide what the best course of action is it s a figure of speech for a reason do random acts of kindness one of the easiest ways to get in the being great at life zone is to focus on others it s easy on you and it feels good in addition to making the world a better place and for just a second you get to forget about your problems and focus on someone else s what s not to like helping others gives us a buzz unlike anything else and doing so can get us out of a rut when we don t have enough energy to help ourselves so whether it s donating some things to a thrift store or volunteering your time at the local homeless shelter try it out might as well build some good karma to be safe get yourself in line no one can go from 0 to 60 in 3 5 and you shouldn t expect this of yourself either we all need assistance and a shove in the right direction no olympian would start the race in a sitting position you know so whatever you need to do do it so sign up for that class find a therapist get serious about your job search succumb to online dating join alcoholics anonymous call your mom and make amends join the gym you ve been driving by every day on the way home from work the first step will be the hardest and it will all be downhill from there do what you ve been wanting to do you ve got your mind right you ve got your body right and now it s time to do that thing you ve been wanting to do that thing you ve been too afraid to do you ve gotta bite that bullet one foot at a time regardless of how long your path to a turned around life is that class you ve signed up for go your therapist make an appointment submit job resumes go on dates attend meetings initiate a family lunch get on that treadmill being amazed at yourself and the things you can create will be such a good feeling it ll be hard to stop periodically reevaluate consider this a diet for your soul any diet that isn t working needs to be dropped so routine evaluation is necessary are you beginning to feel better are things slowly but surely falling into line could you up the efforts you re making just like you need to increase the intensity of your workouts as you progress you need to keep pushing your mind too what works for you right now may not be enough in a few weeks time once you get a grip on the efforts you ve started out with add more and more there are very few things in life you can go cold turkey on and this isn t one of them to a similar end what you think will work might not if that s the case talk to your mentor and get advice on what you should do is it something you need to push through abandon completely or is there a different tactic you should take refuse to give up you re in a very precarious position right now a wrong footing and it ll be too easy to fall back to where you were so right now focus on staying motivated focus on positive thinking focus on breathing focus on doing you if you refuse to give up guess what you won t obstacles happen they crop up without warning and sometimes unyieldingly so the car breaks down the relationship falters the cravings get worse and worse knowing these will happen is important that way you re a little prepared and don t blame yourself they happen to everyone and they re a part of life you just gotta roll with the punches,Work-World
how to move forward,it s easy to get yourself stuck in a rut and even if you want to move forward with your life you may not know where to start before you can gain any momentum you ll need to know which behaviors you have to drop and which you ll need to pick up once you gain an understanding of this you can begin taking the first few steps forward into a better tomorrow,let go of past failures and pains 1 x research source regret guilt and fixation on the bad things that happened in your past can prevent you from moving forward in the present and into the future you can no longer control the past but you can prevent the past from controlling you consider mistakes you made in the past that you don t want to repeat gather any practical lessons you can from those mistakes and let go of any theoretical fears surrounding those mistakes for instance a child may burn himself by touching a hot stove and thereby learn not to touch other hot stoves but that experience does not need to prevent that child from touching and exploring other parts of his world past interactions with people can cause you to develop grudges against them but grudges also drain you of your own energy and resources and ultimately hold you back don t surrender control to other people your life is yours to live others may offer guidance and advice some of this can be helpful and some of it can be hurtful regardless you need to make decisions based on your own desires and ideas without worrying about what others expect of you keep in mind that even the people closest to you have a limited understanding of who you are at the core when you pursue a goal some may criticize you if it does not fall in line with the things they view as important for instance your new passion may not make much money so someone who values money as a high priority will likely view it as a waste of time remember that your values and others values are not always the same so running your life according to another s values will not bring satisfaction to your own life decide to let go of indecisiveness failing to make a choice is a choice in itself train yourself to be a more decisive person if you cling to your indecisiveness you will continue to doubt yourself at the most crucial moments stop procrastinating now right now you have an indefinite number of tomorrows to deal with and telling yourself that you will start doing something tomorrow can quickly become a habit stop putting things off and start doing them immediately think of it this way you may end up pursuing a wrong path but the sooner you embark on that path the quicker you can learn your error and set it right dragging out the journey will only limit your future opportunities quit running away problems and issues inevitably arise and many of these issues cannot be avoided forever the more time you waste on running away the less time you have for moving forward for instance if there is a misunderstanding or other form of tension between you and someone else try talking it out with that person the relationship could break apart afterward but it could also end up becoming stronger either way the issue will only continue to fester in your life until you take care of it drop the excuses granted there are often legitimate obstacles that may prevent you from pursuing a specific goal or idea but oftentimes something one considers to be an obstacle can be overcome with a little effort when there is an obstacle that you can remedy telling yourself that it prevents you from accomplishing something is simply an excuse and these excuses need to stop release the need for explanations 2 x research source things often happen in life without reason or sense wanting an explanation for something is natural but fixating on that desire can actually hold you back if you refuse to act before you have an explanation realize and release your fears everyone has his or her own set of fears and anxieties be honest with yourself when identifying the fears that hold you back once you know what these fears are work at letting them go heartbreak is a major fear especially for those who have already suffered from it understand that things can work out with another person even if they didn t work out with someone from your past another fear that haunts many people is fear of the unknown change is a scary thing things can get better or they can get worse by avoiding possible evils that could lie around the corner though you end up forcing yourself to deal with current evils that definitely do exist already while depriving yourself of possible goods some people even fear success especially if they do not like to stand out understand however that people who treat you poorly because of how you stand out are generally not worth impressing in the first place accept imperfection nobody is perfect after all mistakes are a part of life and you will continue making mistakes regardless of what you do or don t do the sooner you embrace the fact that you are imperfect the quicker you can begin acting in spite of that fact look at the positives and appreciate the present it can be far too easy to focus on all the negative things in life instead of thinking about everything that s wrong though take a good look at everything that s right and good life is often better than one might perceive it to be think about the things you are fortunate to have and be grateful for them instead of bemoaning the fact that you can t afford to take an exciting vacation or buy an impressive car think about the support you get from family and friends or the simple pleasures you can enjoy in your own neighborhood you should even acknowledge the good in things you plan to give up for instance you might give up a career that you felt miserable in but that career did provide you with a comfortable life that in itself is something to be glad for focus on the future learn from your past appreciate your present and focus on your future thinking ahead to the life you want to have will give you something to pursue and having something to pursue will make it easier to walk forward in the midst of focusing on the future you also need to make sure that you do not spend too much time worrying about it plan out what you can and form dreams but don t sweat the little details you can t control or predict everything anyway concentrate on one definite goal and aim high a definite goal gives you something to aim for having too many goals can scatter your energy in too many different directions though since you are only focusing on one goal at a time it is even more important to set goals that challenge you and make the most out of your capabilities believe in yourself be confident and be brave think about who you want to be and reassure yourself that you already possess the basic qualifications you ll need in order to become that person by thinking as if you are already the person you want to become your behaviors and mental images will naturally begin to fall in line with those needed to actually become that person have a little self compassion try not to be too hard on yourself when you do struggle moving forward is difficult for many people and you re bound to take a step or two back once in a while show yourself a little compassion for your own weaknesses but reassure yourself that those weaknesses do not define you take comfort in old favorites when the changes in your life threaten to overwhelm you turn to familiar comforts to give yourself a rest watch a favorite movie eat a favorite meal or visit a favorite place 3 x research source foster good relationships surrounding yourself with positive people will make it easier to maintain your own positive attitude drop as much drama as possible and nurture the relationships that provide you with the most strength be reasonable in your relationships and stop expecting people to act in certain ways allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised by positive interactions instead of being disappointed by negative interactions find someone reliable to talk to about your fears and insecurities make sure that this person can listen and advise you without letting his or her own issues interfere when dealing with others give without thinking of receiving in return sometimes your dedication will be returned in kind other times it won t be regardless you will build the skills and attitude needed to maintain meaningful relationships as a result of your own actions do what you love and love what you do one of the easiest ways to build passion is to focus on the things that you already love or have a strong interest in by doing what you love on a daily basis you will likely end up loving your everyday life look at your habits and interests and determine if there is any way to profit from them build on your strengths everyone is naturally gifted in some area if you aren t sure where to begin start from one of your strong points and build from there it may not be a love per se but it could develop into one or point you in the right direction make a stop doing list 4 x research source many people do things they think they should do rather than things that they want to do oftentimes even the things you think you should do are not even necessary take the time to sit down and make a list of all the things you should do that aren t actually necessary or desirable to figure out what you need to stop doing ask yourself which things are draining your enthusiasm and stopping you from reaching your goals of these things honestly ask yourself which are necessary and which are only done out of a misplaced sense of obligation make sure that the things on your stop doing list are legitimate problems for example you might think that you re unhappy with your marriage when in actuality you re unhappy at work and allowing that dissatisfaction to bleed into other areas of your life focus on the can do portions first a big goal can seem daunting so break it down into smaller parts chances are there is at least one action you can take right now to make your dream a reality discover that action and start doing it for instance if you want to start a new business you can take the first step by starting a blog and various social media accounts for that business once you have something tangible to look at it might be easier to do the research you need to do before pursuing the next tangible step help people with similar problems finding the solution to your own problems can be difficult because it is impossible for you to view things objectively on the other hand helping someone solve their own problems can allow you to be an objective observer you can then take what you ve learned by helping others and apply the knowledge to your own circumstances take a trip 5 x research source taking in a fresh scenery can often change your whole perspective on life if you struggle with taking your first steps forward while in the midst of your everyday routine change things up a bit by taking a short trip taking a trip also forces you to think in the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future you can also make this into a practical exercise by going to a seminar conference or event related to a new career or interest you want to pursue try something new another way to change your daily routine and work yourself out of your rut is to simply try something you ve never done before the change does not need to be anything immensely exciting or daring but it should be something that interests you even though it lies just outside of your usual comfort zone for example sing karaoke somewhere to break yourself out of your shell or take a class on something you ve never tried whether it s kickboxing or cake decorating get creative and stretch yourself,Work-World
how to keep a life changing resolution,at the beginning of each year many people make a decision to seek a fresh start the new year is a great time to commit to a life changing resolution such as becoming healthier finding a new career paying more heed to your close relationships and so forth yet making the resolution is one thing sticking to it is quite another and many people fail to follow through to the commitment s end to increase your chances of keeping your life changing resolution here are some simple ways to increase your chances,rekindle your inner imp who says the better you is your stuffy self all prim and proper with so many edicts to behave yourself sometimes there s a risk you ll equate being better with conforming to some highly unrealistic standard planted in your head by confused media messages yes it is important to eat healthily exercise and quit bad habits but equally moderation requires that you accept yourself and let go of any scolding approach to self improvement when you let out the silly sassy playfully mischievous and audacious person within you reveal your true colors you can accomplish anything as long as you drop the fault finding and look for all that s right with you be non committal play with marvelous ideas for a bit half of the stuff we say we will do we never actually plan on really doing all the promises you feel obligated to do will be completely trashed within the first week because you resent them rather than treating your resolutions as absolute commitments try something novel consider them as trials try them on for size to see if they fit you may find that the harsh exercise regime is actually wrong for your body type while forgoing those chocolates is a sure way to end up eating more of them give yourself the wriggle room to ease into change bit by bit gradual change is likely to last long term because you re buying into it and remember you can do anything set your mind to once you really want to meanwhile play until you feel the time is right much advice on making resolutions suggest you commit publicly while this may shame you into making changes that s really not a good basis for making a change you must want to shift your old self into a new self and revealing your intentions to other people can open you up to naysayers getting picked on when your progress seems slower than expected or having people give a ton of unwanted advice the better approach is to zip it show an enigmatic smile if anyone questions your intentions and simply let the internal commitment motivate you in its own way instead acknowledge that you re complex there is a tendency to feel that the old you has to be shown the door and the new you will miraculously be much better yet it s both unrealistic to expect such a dramatic transformation and it s a denial of the reality that you re already a complex being with many facets which part of yourself are you challenging to change you ll need to think of the trigger situations or people who bring out the facets of yourself that you re not so proud of rather than assuming a one size solution will create change hence a renowned diet may sound great but unless you face the reason why you overeat eat the wrong sorts of foods or fail to exercise that diet resolution is doomed only you know yourself well enough to face the deeper truths live in a land of conundrums many resolutions tend to be all or nothing black and white and this tends to be why they re set to fail so rather than stating i intend to stop eating fried food forever and assuming you will stick to this strict finality give yourself the freedom to mix and match solutions that even each other out and restore the fun in life slow down and pick up the pace try yoga and drink triple lattes let your childlike wisdom shine try modern urban rustic decoration be a modern minimalist multi tasker drink nonalcoholic beer experiment with the extremes and see what marvelous moments you come up with be unrealistic being realistic limits your options and tends to keep you in the zone of that ll never work a place most people stay in you won t change when you re too invested in worrying about what might go wrong or what might hurt you to get beyond this impasse think bigger about the world than you ever have before go outside your comfort zone dream beyond your expectations you have miraculous abilities to accomplish all you desire so passionately dream and dream some more in vivid technicolor if possible keep dreaming until you have considered every imaginable possibility that thrills you some of it may well be too fantastical but within your dreaming solid and workable ideas and plans will form finally you ll feel empowered by the process steal resources why recreate the wheel just find all the people around you who have achieved the same or similar goals find out what worked for them and what didn t try their solutions on for size add plenty of personal modifications so the color style and habits fit you like a glove following in the footsteps of others is a tremendous way of enhancing your own talents and ideas to reinvent and to make new discoveries from your own perspective knowing what others know is an investment in yourself never before have so many people had so many opportunities to learn from skillful inspiring intelligent interesting and innovative people than in our era of the internet you can find out about almost any public figure you admire through video lectures websites and other online resources what are you waiting for get busy resolutions lack spine if you fail to act they ll flop about in your gray matter turning into sources of resentment when you ignore the work needed to implement them make the effort in small ways getting started gives your resolution life and gives you motivation and be very careful not to let resolutions turn into vague affirmations sitting around all day telling yourself that things are going to change and get better won t bring the universe to you get up get going and something will happen in the doing throw your arms up give in and give up it s the stress and strain that s got your panties in a bunch without the worry and sense of urgency that comes from impatience perfectionism and over attachment to single issues you can do some pretty fierce stuff you always got great results in the past when you were free flowing energized and in the moment let go now and see what happens be selfish give yourself unadulterated permission to think about you and only you be incredibly opinionated and resolute about what feels wonderful then go for what you want allow yourself to connect with your true desires wants and needs toss out societal expectations and indulge in what makes you smile,Work-World

sometimes it s difficult to see our own strengths clearly make a list of your priorities 2 x research source spend time thinking about your priorities divorced from what you know your current obligations are take note of the happiest moments in your life and prioritize the parts of your life that deliver these moments to you remember you don t need to think about what s feasible and what isn t just what truly makes you tick this will help you see what you cherish rather than the strategies you ll use to get them keep the list short and sweet no longer than five things ask yourself the following questions in order to connect with your priorities how would you like to live your life would you like to be healthy and vital would you like to have deeper connections with people in your life what will make you proud to be able to say about yourself in ten years time write out a daily schedule when you have a completely average day what does it entail by laying out a daily schedule not of what you want for yourself but of what you actually do you can see your current strategies for meeting your priorities now that you have this schedule see if your priorities are reflected in your daily activity or not can you draw links between what you cherish and what you know must be taken care of each day for example if you already eat a nourishing breakfast in the morning you can

confused about where to place an activity like calling your mom ask yourself do you call your mom daily because you would feel guilty or fear hurting her if you don t check in or do you talk to her frequently because you prioritize family and talking to her sparks the joy of connection in you yes to the first option shows that the activity is urgent and yes to the second means that it is valuable list your obligations and duties these need not be only the obligations that we consider crucial like paying rent and buying groceries but also the obligations that you feel you have toward others what are the things that you have to do for fear of some type of punishment or shame while these will not go away completely recognition of what you do out of fear will sharpen your ability to see when you are acting from a priority and when you are acting out of fear urgency or obligation slowly you ll learn to make different decisions about what needs to be done and when this time caring for your priorities and growth rather than simply running in fear of consequences begin to notice which obligations can be altered split or delegated in order for your values and priorities to be

more concrete soon just keep it in mind a generic unhappiness or sense of anger is a red flag that something s up and you do know the reason why it s just hiding from you for right now instigate a self image overhaul if someone tells you that you can t change your personality they re wrong for example you can go from an introvert to an extrovert you can go from awkward to socially apt and you

much everything stop and smell the roses has more truth to it in this day and age than ever before so when you re sitting with your best friend over coffee think about how great it is when you re

quicker than you can that mcdouble what are you going to choose making health accessible is the only way you can stick to it so keep half a dozen choices in your pantry fruits and nuts mainly and the

becoming that person becomes 10x easier the next time you re in a situation whether it s with a friend or in front of the fridge think about what this ideal you would do and then you can do it do you

to get any enjoyment out of it at all really when we feel confident even if it s for a minute nothing can really bring us down it s a tough nut to crack but once you do you won t be able to go back need something a little more concrete try saying no once every day you probably constantly do things for other people things you don t really want to do things to appease others and just once say no do something for you quiet that pushover inside you and spend your time how you would choose sometimes you need to put others first yes but there needs to be time for you too monitor the mental chatter we all have it that voice in your head that tells you you shouldn t or can t do something that you should feel shame guilt or intimidation what good is that voice anyway has it ever done you any favors when you start hearing it stop start thinking about what good these thoughts are doing you ain t nobody got time for that in the end everything that matters is in your head it s how you feel about it you could wake up tomorrow and you re life would be improved simply because you feel it s improved so grabbing this chatter in your head by the horns and taking the reins is really the only way you can get to that improvement the bad news it s a challenge the good news you have all the power get rid of toxic friends sometimes it s hard to realize that the people around us those we care about aren t actually good for us is there someone in your life that leaves you feeling drained more than energized they re probably a toxic friend as much as it may be awkward and difficult to initiate you gotta get rid of em they re doing you no good they re just dragging you down the thing about toxic friends is you know it when you have one you don t really have that good of a time when you re with them they leave you feeling kind of bad about yourself in a funny way and life is just a bit darker even after they ve gone away in other words why again are you hanging out with them identify good things about those around you it s all too easy to get caught up in how your partner family friends roommates annoy the crap outta you you end up gossiping about each other resenting them when they put the toilet paper on in the wrong direction hating that face they make all the time when really they re wonderful people we just forget about all their awesome qualities because the negative is so much easier to see concentrating on the positive will make your life feel so much more complete even though technically nothing has changed take a minute to remember what drew you to them in the first place are they funny kind quick witted smart or honest do they make a mean chocolate cake always remember to tivo your favorite tv show not laugh at you when you have food stuck in your teeth exactly not everyone does that be affectionate you know how much you care about the ones you love but they may be starting to forget when you re more affectionate you ll get more affection in return making your life seem more full of love and all that sugary good stuff getting more hugs is a definite improvement you know for the g rated side of it all write a letter to a faraway friend as the years pass it seems like the norm is to go faster and faster and faster as a result we let our friendships fade and quit concentrating on the stuff there just doesn t seem to be time for so take a break and reach out to that friend that moved far away or that you moved away from snail mail is becoming less and less common that letter you write them will put a huge grin on their face and you ll feel so good for keeping up with them our minds reward us for being social how else would humans survive if our brains weren t trained for it so the more effort you make the wider your social circle will feel the more people you can depend on and the better your life will be it s the small stuff that ll get this done connect to someone new alright so you ve connected to the old friend now it s time to liven up your social network by connecting to someone new this can be done every day and with little effort and afterward you ll feel totally accomplished not to mention probably having learned something or laughing so talk to your cashier hit up your new neighbor make an effort with that quiet coworker there are opportunities everywhere if you re at a loss for how to start try disconnecting first disconnecting to connect that s right put down your phone take out your headphones stop checking your email every 5 minutes and start staring life in the face it s the only way you can recognize and take advantage of the people and things in front of you it s the only way to get the most out of everything is what s on your phone candy crush really that much more interesting than the people in front of you do good deeds like fo real you know that phrase it s better to give than to receive well it s true it s so so true do some good deeds for others and your life will feel so much better for it you ll feel like you re doing something that matters you ll be accomplishing something you ll be affecting the lives of others for the better what s not awesome about that improving someone else s life is a way to improve yours the logic doesn t seem totally direct but it s just as simple and just as effective and it s much more enriching knowing the world is better because of you need some examples help your old neighbor get around have a friend that has three kids all with extracurriculars offer to pick them up from school give your waitress who s in grad school an awesome tip and if someone does something for you be sure to pay it forward volunteer this is basically taking do good deeds a step further instead of these good deeds being spur of the moment take a scheduled time out of your week to volunteer though you should still be doing those good things go to your local animal shelter homeless shelter hospital school or nursing home and ask how you can help they d be crazy to turn you away what better way to spend your time an hour a week makes a difference and if you re thinking what s in it for me even apart from it feeling good it looks great on resumes and just in general conversation loads of people hold down jobs a family travel read and make time for the gym very few of them add volunteering on top of that,Work-World
how to get your life back in order,have you ever wondered how to get your life back in order after experiencing a period of chaos without a doubt many of us resort to getting bent out of shape instead of empowering ourselves to get up and get going again although it s not very healthy it s easy to just feel sorry for ourselves and not do anything about our circumstances or to make things worse through self destructive habits however the key to life as einstein said is like riding a bicycle to stay balanced you have to keep going,evaluate how you spend your time unless it s down time you ve established any activity that doesn t produce a tangible result or lead you to success is most likely a waste of time this does not include meaningful time for reflection which is key to getting your life back in order simply choose which things in your life are important to you and which are not first make a list of things that you normally do on a daily and or weekly basis and write down how much time you spend on each activity then take the items on that list and cross off the things that are useless in your life and you spend too much time on make a do and don t list cut back on unnecessary activities look at the things you crossed off and what you still have on your other list does this seem reasonable the main goal is to get you to stop spending so much time on useless things now that you know what to avoid doing replace them with more productive activities for example going to the movies or browsing on the computer half as often will give you more time or if you watch tv for 5 hours a day you re definitely wasting some time in your life shut down social spheres some people are big on having as many windows open as possible when they are on the computer they say it helps them to not forget important tasks and to stay on track but if it sounds like you you probably notice that the notification figures are constantly flashing and before you know it you re distracted by tweets directing you to another great article photo updates about dinner selections and an irresistible yet pointless online argument shut these social communities down and take control 1 x research source figure out times of the day to check back in take advantage of the useful time management tools out there to schedule updates for the day you ll soon be so busy being productive that you won t notice that the social world you were so heavily immersed in has disappeared get up early and use this valuable time to focus take advantage of the energy that comes with the rising sun as many people are still not up and creating chaos in the world it s a great time to be highly productive leave the social sites and personal emails for later begin with a short morning meditation that centers you and focuses you and make a list of what you would like to accomplish then start right away on the work that will help you achieve your goals choose that this will be a good day 2 x research source though you can also use part of this time for meditation or exercise meditation can help greatly to clear your mind and to help you feel refreshed and relaxed again if you set 5 30 to 7 30 a m aside each morning this will give you a solid two hours of concentrated work it s incredible what you can achieve in this time say no when you need to and don t feel bad about it there are periods in life when it s nearly impossible to keep up there are meetings dinner dates parties conferences and all kinds of other situations that demand our presence it s great to feel wanted but at what cost trying to go to every single thing will almost definitely have a negative effect on your productivity say no to things that aren t absolutely essential by doing this you will be opening the door so that more important opportunities can take priority 3 x research source ask yourself how will saying yes help you to improve the most important areas in your life if it doesn t then say no make a healthy diet plan with an emphasis on whole grains vegetables fruits and protein sources a healthy diet can have a powerful effect on your overall energy levels as well as your mood even eating healthy foods for one or two days can make you feel like you ve gotten your life back under control again while it also physically restores balance in your body add vitamins to your daily diet certain vitamin supplements can have a tremendous effect in reducing the amount of stress that you most likely went through during that recent hectic period of your life no matter how healthy your diet is you may still be deficient with certain nutrients due to stress and anxiety the absolute best vitamins to help in bringing stress levels back down are b vitamins and vitamin c omega fish oils are also good for mind and body balance practice meditation or breathing exercises as mentioned above stress can have such a detrimental effect on a person s productivity levels when you feel that you have too much on you it s easy to forget to breathe properly at times so take deep long breaths and instantly improve the flow of oxygen to your brain spend more time in nature being in the great outdoors is never a waste of time nature has the ability to clear a person s thoughts and soothe a troubled mind climbing a mountain or taking a walk in the woods gives us clarity again on what s important and helps us to feel connected with the universe appreciating your natural surroundings can be a great way to ground oneself and restore positive energy 4 x research source take time to stretch your muscles schedule a massage to improve circulation muscle tone and remove harmful toxins take a yoga class there are so many different classes and teachers available so there is definitely a style and a teacher out there for you you may have to take a few classes that you re not crazy about but that s okay because when you find the one for you it could be well worth it cut back on cigarettes alcohol and other bad habits hands down these are harmful crutches and some of these vices can seriously cloud your judgment and decisions the money you save and the health you gain by stopping one or more of these habits can be put into something more rewarding such as joining a hiking club or buying a spa pass for a week like the period you just went through there are those times where everything seems out of control now that the dust has settled this is the time to focus on your body temple again besides being self destructive gives the people around you permission to be so as well and this can attract the wrong types of people into your life at the time when you re trying to get things back together organize first buy last take a common problem the magazines that have been lying around for months on end you say you have to do something about them so you rush off to the store to buy a dozen magazine holders it s probably best to sit down though and figure out which ones you actually should keep and the ones you should toss remember sometimes less is more hit the yard sales sometimes you can find real gems in sales like this many items that sellers give away for next to nothing are because they had to move and can t make use of what was in their home before the bookshelf racks that were just right in their previous living area are now too wide in their new space so their loss is your find in getting more organized at a fraction of the cost reach out to the community and earn something for yourself put it away the simplest thing you can do to stay organized is to put whatever hairbrush bag article of clothing tool or item away right after using it basically you want to know where everything is so that you never have to waste time looking for it ask yourself this question could you tell a stranger where to find anything where you live if not you probably need to get more organized 5 x research source use the trash basket recycling bin organizing things you don t need is simply a waste of precious time it is incredible how much more in control you will feel by ridding yourself of outdated articles you re going to read someday or pages of notes from which pertinent action items have already been taken care of for many of us the reason we accumulated things is because we just don t want to take a look at it this is a cultivated habit however and can be changed what you will find with many of these items is that you can now just throw them away so try not to be afraid of your accumulated stuff you will feel a lot more empowered and be much more organized as a result find a paper calendar a sheet of paper and a white board on your paper you write your to do list for today keep that with you throughout the day by the end whatever you can t get done gets moved to the calendar the white board is kept for you to make scribbly notes on at any given moment 6 x research source write down your three most important tasks it s easy to get overwhelmed with everything we think we have to do however take a look at your essential and non essential tasks not everything is essential sometimes we can think that because we are racing around

how to turn your life around,to be satisfied with life you need to change and adapt to changes the good news no one can do it for you but you the first step is always the hardest but with determination and the right mindset you can overcome just about anything if you ve had enough of how things are right now what lies around the corner can and will be completely different,pinpoint the issues regardless of what s going on in your world you probably know why your life is stuck is it your job friends relationship bad habits your general outlook all five of these and then some are you afraid to admit what s actually the issue you have to figure out what s wrong before you can fix anything thankfully you have all the answers it s possible your answer is everything all too often one facet of our lives bleeds into the other don t be daunted by this at the end of the day you create your life whether one thing needs to be fixed or everything needs to be fixed it s all doable it ll just be a little more work you ll need some mental resetting but it s all doable identify your mental blocks being stuck in a miserable job isn t the problem it s a symptom of the problem being too scared to apply for a new job or being too lazy in your current comfortable easy routine you know that phrase you are your own worst enemy that applies here you are not to blame for the hand you ve been dealt but you are responsible for how you played it what patterns of thinking have been keeping you from playing it better being self aware is the only way you can really change your thinking changing your thinking changes your behavior changing your behavior changes what happens to you if you want a problem to stop you gotta cut it off at the root so while this may all seem like a long winded unnecessary approach to turning things around it s not at least the unnecessary part this your thinking your mental blocks must be tackled before any change can really be had question the thoughts and beliefs that are making you unhappy ready to have your mind blown you live in a world of your thoughts think about that sit back in your chair right now and wrap your mind around that everything right now is a construction of you of your thinking of your mind this should lead you to a couple of conclusions awesome you have the power to live however you want if you wanted to believe you were the queen of england you could if you wanted to believe you were happy you would be you are the only person that holds the power when it comes to turning your life around those things that are making you unhappy some of them are imaginary true you might have a crappy job and that s undeniable you might be in a dead end relationship you might be unemployed you might be addicted to hard drugs you might be suicidal you might be going nowhere but how you view your situation can put a spin on things that will make them better will make them easier easy to know sure less easy to do but knowing this is a fact of life is half the battle won put your attitude to work in order for good things to happen to you you have to be in the mindset of expecting success have you ever tried to walk up to that cute boy or girl with the belief that you ll fail exactly either you just plain don t or you do manage to walk up nervous scared and visibly insecure all of life isn t that different to get success you kind of have to expect it so if you re working with a negative attitude that s gotta change start working on positive thinking it can be quite the chore so just start with 15 minutes a day when a negative thought creeps up take the time to reframe it it won t come naturally at first but you ll get better at it for that 15 minutes my life is terrible becomes i m not happy with life right now and am going to do something about it work on this until you don t allow the negative thoughts at all it ll be so much easier to get out of bed and take action when your mind is ready and raring to go allow yourself the power newsflash happiness doesn t come from removing your problems there are impoverished hungry children in this world who smile and laugh every day there are people who are in similar situations to you who consider themselves lucky to be alive so allow yourself the power to make yourself happy to view yourself worthy of success allow yourself control over your life instead of pretending you re an innocent bystander take the reins you got this you re on this page so clearly you have some motivation to do something that s all you need and you have it you need to make the decision to do something when you do things will change they have to they can t not latch onto this motivation and let it fester let it grow until it explodes get power hungry things are about to happen find a passion you can work towards it s hard to turn your life around if you don t know what direction to face you know having a passion some goal or dream to strive for gives you a path to tread instead of foraging about for a needle in a haystack that may or may not be there so what s yours where would you like to be in six months a year do you see yourself living in the same town maybe a different job working on a new project or business in school significantly more fit there s no wrong answer here and you can have more than one too devise a plan of action with a clearer trajectory now it s time for a very loose plan of action to form come up with half a dozen things you can feasibly do to start down the path you see the future you on you don t have to start today you don t have to start tomorrow but you do have to know where you re going and what you want to do we ve sorted out the end goal going back to school losing weight quitting smoking etc now how do you get there that s what this is for what steps small ones big ones whatever can get the ball rolling so when the time comes when you re ready you ll know what the future has in store remove dead weight whether it s quitting smoking dumping your lame boyfriend or moving out of your mob running roommate s apartment it s gotta be done these things are holding you back they re facilitating this negative mindset and turning an obstacle into a veritable mountain to climb over it may be a pain in the rear end but you know you can do it dumping your toxic best friend sucks having to live on your own in a crappy studio sucks going through withdrawal sucks but they re all things that you re capable of and that you ll be better for in the end and quite frankly you probably know it things like quitting your job sort of fall into a different category in today s day and age you need money to survive but realistically you could quit and move in with someone temporarily if you absolutely had to you could spend your weekends looking for a new one no one said this was going to be pretty sometimes things have to get worse before they get better you have to be willing to put in the work find a mentor why because we all need someone who s been there for their advice for their shoulder for the heads up and if you think there s no one in your life who s hit rock bottom you re probably wrong part of being human is about fighting battles all you need to do is ask the odds of you knowing the sordid history of everyone in your circle is slim to none however what s more likely is that when you read the phrase find a mentor one or two names pop into your head generally this is a more natural process than anything if you have to ask someone to be your mentor they re probably not this is just a role that s fulfilled by someone who s been there done that and bought the t shirt you just need to take advantage of their presence in your life by opening up to them and asking for assistance when you need it quit being fake don t get offended we all are we all say yes to invitations we don t want to say yes to we all smile and nod when inside we re sending daggers with our eyes we all do things that society has told us are okay and left it at that no questions asked well start asking questions make it a point to say no thanks when you don t feel like it right now is about being selfish and improving you it s not an excuse to be rude it s an excuse to do what you want this will not hurt others feelings if you re just being yourself declining an offer with a no thanks i m not feeling up to it isn t offensive people may ask further questions but they don t need an explanation if you don t want to give one you re just doing you right now if they have a problem with it it s theirs to have exercise sleep well and eat right your mind and body are interconnected if your body feels good it s a lot easier for your mind to feel good the three tenets of having a body that s ready to take on the world exercising getting enough quality sleep and eating healthily if you don t have time for these make time you owe it to yourself as for exercise try to get in a session 3 or 4 times a week whether that s hitting up kickboxing class or going for a walk with your dog it s all good just get out there and stick with it skeptical as to how this matters research says exercise can actually make you happier 1 x research source get enough sleep your decision making skills hinge on it seriously 2 x research source when our bodies and minds are tired we don t have the energy to weigh out what s actually good for us need an example that late night chalupa you decided to eat was a good idea only when it comes to your life it actually matters so get in your 7 9 hours of sleep a night it affects the other 15 17 hours more than we d like to admit your diet can also affect your mood 3 x research source loading up on whole grains fruits and veggies and sticking to lean meats and low fat dairy can give you that edge that you were previously lacking motivate yourself little things can actually make the biggest of differences jumping out of bed in the morning instead of hitting the snooze button can make you feel much more energized despite logic to the contrary listening to uplifting music leaving yourself positive little notes rewarding yourself for strides made it all builds up and can keep you on track change your alarm to something awesome if you re anything like the rest of us you wake up in the morning and all you can think of is no starting out the day negatively can seriously hinder the rest of it so start out as positively as possible change your alarm to something that invigorates you whether it s the circle of life or the ride of the valkyries is up to you no can turn into hell yes easier than you thought develop a routine studies have shown that people who are successful and content generally have a routine they stick to the routine they stick to probably isn t staying in bed all day and consuming buckets of fried chicken sure but what s more important is that their routine allows them to conserve energy when you have a daily routine going onto autopilot allows you to expend mental focus on deflating and getting rid of problems that arise you can only make so many decisions in a day and this routine allows you to save energy for the important stuff 4 x research source your routine should involve those three things mentioned above eating exercising and sleeping right and whatever else makes you happy a little bit of work a little bit of play and some self improvement time whatever form that takes meditation job searching going back to school etc make your most important decisions on anything in the morning why you are less likely to be emotionally and physically exhausted decision fatigue is definitely a thing like that poorly thought out late night chalupa at night we ve done so much work all day we throw caution to the wind and let our present selves make poor decisions for our future selves don t do it so if something big presents itself sleep on it you want as much energy as possible to decide what the best course of action is it s a figure of speech for a reason do random acts of kindness one of the easiest ways to get in the being great at life zone is to focus on others it s easy on you and it feels good in addition to making the world a better place and for just a second you get to forget about your problems and focus on someone else s what s not to like helping others gives us a buzz unlike anything else and doing so can get us out of a rut when we don t have enough energy to help ourselves so whether it s donating some things to a thrift store or volunteering your time at the local homeless shelter try it out might as well build some good karma to be safe get yourself in line no one can go from 0 to 60 in 3 5 and you shouldn t expect this of yourself either we all need assistance and a shove in the right direction no olympian would start the race in a sitting position you know so whatever you need to do do it so sign up for that class find a therapist get serious about your job search succumb to online dating join alcoholics anonymous call your mom and make amends join the gym you ve been driving by every day on the way home from work the first step will be the hardest and it will all be downhill from there do what you ve been wanting to do you ve got your mind right you ve got your body right and now it s time to do that thing you ve been wanting to do that thing you ve been too afraid to do you ve gotta bite that bullet one foot at a time regardless of how long your path to a turned around life is that class you ve signed up for go your therapist make an appointment submit job resumes go on dates attend meetings initiate a family lunch get on that treadmill being amazed at yourself and the things you can create will be such a good feeling it ll be hard to stop periodically reevaluate consider this a diet for your soul any diet that isn t working needs to be dropped so routine evaluation is necessary are you beginning to feel better are things slowly but surely falling into line could you up the efforts you re making just like you need to increase the intensity of your workouts as you progress you need to keep pushing your mind too what works for you right now may not be enough in a few weeks time once you get a grip on the efforts you ve started out with add more and more there are very few things in life you can go cold turkey on and this isn t one of them to a similar end what you think will work might not if that s the case talk to your mentor and get advice on what you should do is it something you need to push through abandon completely or is there a different tactic you should take refuse to give up you re in a very precarious position right now a wrong footing and it ll be too easy to fall back to where you were so right now focus on staying motivated focus on positive thinking focus on breathing focus on doing you if you refuse to give up guess what you won t obstacles happen they crop up without warning and sometimes unyieldingly so the car breaks down the relationship falters the cravings get worse and worse knowing these will happen is important that way you re a little prepared and don t blame yourself they happen to everyone and they re a part of life you just gotta roll with the punches,Work-World

relationship if that is the case you would be better off without that individual in your life at this time balance your work life and personal life separating your work life and your home personal

traffic is worst and try to find an alternate route that would bypass that area and save you time add up the time it takes you to get to work on a normal day and the amount of time you re occasionally late by due to factors like traffic then simply leave that much earlier perhaps with an extra 10 minutes to spare in case things get really delayed reward yourself for your consistency perhaps you can

out what exactly is getting you down chances are you already have an idea of what s bugging you be honest with yourself once you identify the source of your discontent you are free to commit to changing it if you can t seem to put your finger on what s making you unhappy consider keeping a journal it doesn t have to be very elaborate or time consuming at the end of each day write down a few reflections about what happened and how you re feeling after a while it won t be difficult to identify the negative patterns keeping a journal has been proven to help people track their bad habits and quit them altogether you can also try a tool like the wheel of life which helps you brainstorm what is important to you and assess both where you are and where you want to be in these areas 1 x

consider speaking with a therapist they can help you develop techniques to move forward start small if you are in a rut chances are you ve been doing things the same way for quite a while trying to change every aspect of your life overnight is just unrealistic not to mention incredibly daunting you ll find that success comes much more easily if you set an achievable goal to begin with if you have decided to make huge changes in your life break them up into a series of goals you are much more likely to succeed if you manage your expectations 2 x research source for instance if you want to go back to college make it your first goal to research schools that offer the program you want to do this is an easily accomplished yet vital step in your journey making small changes such as taking a

most positive things just take time and feeling grief can cause you to move backward on everything you ve accomplished look at what you have already finished and compliment yourself on it after all you are that many steps closer to completing your mission get right back into your new routine it is completely normal to fall back into old comfortable habits even if those habits make you unhappy the important thing is to identify when you have fallen off track and then immediately get back on don t let one imperfect day throw off your whole plan sometimes you might fall off track for a longer period of time maybe something unexpected happened or you just lost your motivation try to remember the first time you decided to make a change and remind yourself that if you were able to do it once you can do it an infinite number of times starting over is not a failure but giving up is practice mindfulness or living in the present sometimes we are more vulnerable to setbacks after we ve already made quite a bit of progress don t let any progress you might have made be your excuse to go back to square one always be conscious of your goal and where you are on your road to achieving it this is

how to move forward,it s easy to get yourself stuck in a rut and even if you want to move forward with your life you may not know where to start before you can gain any momentum you ll need to know which behaviors you have to drop and which you ll need to pick up once you gain an understanding of this you can begin taking the first few steps forward into a better tomorrow,let go of past failures and pains 1 x research source regret guilt and fixation on the bad things that happened in your past can prevent you from moving forward in the present and into the future you can no longer control the past but you can prevent the past from controlling you consider mistakes you made in the past that you don t want to repeat gather any practical lessons you can from those mistakes and let go of any theoretical fears surrounding those mistakes for instance a child may burn himself by touching a hot stove and thereby learn not to touch other hot stoves but that experience does not need to prevent that child from touching and exploring other parts of his world past interactions with people can cause you to develop grudges against them but grudges also drain you of your own energy and resources and ultimately hold you back don t surrender control to other people your life is yours to live others may offer guidance and advice some of this can be helpful and some of it can be hurtful regardless you need to make decisions based on your own desires and ideas without worrying about what others expect of you keep in mind that even the people closest to you have a limited understanding of who you are at the core when you pursue a goal some may criticize you if it does not fall in line with the things they view as important for instance your new passion may not make much money so someone who values money as a high priority will likely view it as a waste of time remember that your values and others values are not always the same so running your life according to another s values will not bring satisfaction to your own life decide to let go of indecisiveness failing to make a choice is a choice in itself train yourself to be a more decisive person if you cling to your indecisiveness you will continue to doubt yourself at the most crucial moments stop procrastinating now right now you have an indefinite number of tomorrows to deal with and telling yourself that you will start doing something tomorrow can quickly become a habit stop putting things off and start doing them immediately think of it this way you may end up pursuing a wrong path but the sooner you embark on that path the quicker you can learn your error and set it right dragging out the journey will only limit your future opportunities quit running away problems and issues inevitably arise and many of these issues cannot be avoided forever the more time you waste on running away the less time you have for moving forward for instance if there is a misunderstanding or other form of tension between you and someone else try talking it out with that person the relationship could break apart afterward but it could also end up becoming stronger either way the issue will only continue to fester in your life until you take care of it drop the excuses granted there are often legitimate obstacles that may prevent you from pursuing a specific goal or idea but oftentimes something one considers to be an obstacle can be overcome with a little effort when there is an obstacle that you can remedy telling yourself that it prevents you from accomplishing something is simply an excuse and these excuses need to stop release the need for explanations 2 x research source things often happen in life without reason or sense wanting an explanation for something is natural but fixating on that desire can actually hold you back if you refuse to act before you have an explanation realize and release your fears everyone has his or her own set of fears and anxieties be honest with yourself when identifying the fears that hold you back once you know what these fears are work at letting them go heartbreak is a major fear especially for those who have already suffered from it understand that things can work out with another person even if they didn t work out with someone from your past another fear that haunts many people is fear of the unknown change is a scary thing things can get better or they can get worse by avoiding possible evils that could lie around the corner though you end up forcing yourself to deal with current evils that definitely do exist already while depriving yourself of possible goods some people even fear success especially if they do not like to stand out understand however that people who treat you poorly because of how you stand out are generally not worth impressing in the first place accept imperfection nobody is perfect after all mistakes are a part of life and you will continue making mistakes regardless of what you do or don t do the sooner you embrace the fact that you are imperfect the quicker you can begin acting in spite of that fact look at the positives and appreciate the present it can be far too easy to focus on all the negative things in life instead of thinking about everything that s wrong though take a good look at everything that s right and good life is often better than one might perceive it to be think about the things you are fortunate to have and be grateful for them instead of bemoaning the fact that you can t afford to take an exciting vacation or buy an impressive car think about the support you get from family and friends or the simple pleasures you can enjoy in your own neighborhood you should even acknowledge the good in things you plan to give up for instance you might give up a career that you felt miserable in but that career did provide you with a comfortable life that in itself is something to be glad for focus on the future learn from your past appreciate your present and focus on your future thinking ahead to the life you want to have will give you something to pursue and having something to pursue will make it easier to walk forward in the midst of focusing on the future you also need to make sure that you do not spend too much time worrying about it plan out what you can and form dreams but don t sweat the little details you can t control or predict everything anyway concentrate on one definite goal and aim high a definite goal gives you something to aim for having too many goals can scatter your energy in too many different directions though since you are only focusing on one goal at a time it is even more important to set goals that challenge you and make the most out of your capabilities believe in yourself be confident and be brave think about who you want to be and reassure yourself that you already possess the basic qualifications you ll need in order to become that person by thinking as if you are already the person you want to become your behaviors and mental images will naturally begin to fall in line with those needed to actually become that person have a little self compassion try not to be too hard on yourself when you do struggle moving forward is difficult for many people and you re bound to take a step or two back once in a while show yourself a little compassion for your own weaknesses but reassure yourself that those weaknesses do not define you take comfort in old favorites when the changes in your life threaten to overwhelm you turn to familiar comforts to give yourself a rest watch a favorite movie eat a favorite meal or visit a favorite place 3 x research source foster good relationships surrounding yourself with positive people will make it easier to maintain your own positive attitude drop as much drama as possible and nurture the relationships that provide you with the most strength be reasonable in your relationships and stop expecting people to act in certain ways allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised by positive interactions instead of being disappointed by negative interactions find someone reliable to talk to about your fears and insecurities make sure that this person can listen and advise you without letting his or her own issues interfere when dealing with others give without thinking of receiving in return sometimes your dedication will be returned in kind other times it won t be regardless you will build the skills and attitude needed to maintain meaningful relationships as a result of your own actions do what you love and love what you do one of the easiest ways to build passion is to focus on the things that you already love or have a strong interest in by doing what you love on a daily basis you will likely end up loving your everyday life look at your habits and interests and determine if there is any way to profit from them build on your strengths everyone is naturally gifted in some area if you aren t sure where to begin start from one of your strong points and build from there it may not be a love per se but it could develop into one or point you in the right direction make a stop doing list 4 x research source many people do things they think they should do rather than things that they want to do oftentimes even the things you think you should do are not even necessary take the time to sit down and make a list of all the things you should do that aren t actually necessary or desirable to figure out what you need to stop doing ask yourself which things are draining your enthusiasm and stopping you from reaching your goals of these things honestly ask yourself which are necessary and which are only done out of a misplaced sense of obligation make sure that the things on your stop doing list are legitimate problems for example you might think that you re unhappy with your marriage when in actuality you re unhappy at work and allowing that dissatisfaction to bleed into other areas of your life focus on the can do portions first a big goal can seem daunting so break it down into smaller parts chances are there is at least one action you can take right now to make your dream a reality discover that action and start doing it for instance if you want to start a new business you can take the first step by starting a blog and various social media accounts for that business once you have something tangible to look at it might be easier to do the research you need to do before pursuing the next tangible step help people with similar problems finding the solution to your own problems can be difficult because it is impossible for you to view things objectively on the other hand helping someone solve their own problems can allow you to be an objective observer you can then take what you ve learned by helping others and apply the knowledge to your own circumstances take a trip 5 x research source taking in a fresh scenery can often change your whole perspective on life if you struggle with taking your first steps forward while in the midst of your everyday routine change things up a bit by taking a short trip taking a trip also forces you to think in the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future you can also make this into a practical exercise by going to a seminar conference or event related to a new career or interest you want to pursue try something new another way to change your daily routine and work yourself out of your rut is to simply try something you ve never done before the change does not need to be anything immensely exciting or daring but it should be something that interests you even though it lies just outside of your usual comfort zone for example sing karaoke somewhere to break yourself out of your shell or take a class on something you ve never tried whether it s kickboxing or cake decorating get creative and stretch yourself,Work-World

you consume each week you will first need to know how much fast food you are eating and under what conditions measure your baseline just jumping right into a behavior modification plan without collecting any data beforehand can jeopardize your results spend several days or weeks carefully examining the occurrence of the behavior that you want to change answering some of the questions that help describe it 3 x research source methods for measuring might be to tally the amount of fast food meals you eat each week as well as determining exactly what you typically order and how much you eat of these meals e g burger fries and milkshake with a total of 1238 calories come up with a replacement behavior since you are looking to make a major life change odds are you want to stop some undesirable behaviors as such it can be helpful to devise a list of alternative behaviors you can do to help with the transition once you closely understand the reason you engage in the undesirable behavior by describing and observing it you can then find healthier behaviors that meet the same urge or stimulus 4 x research source for example if you realize that you always eat fast food on days

develop an action plan that requires you to eat the whole elephant in a day instead break down large tasks to make them more manageable when you re faced with actually eating the elephant the only feasible way you can do it is one bite at a time make your plan as clear and detailed as possible for instance if you are trying to lose a large amount of weight you might focus first on changing lifestyle habits such as your diet and activity level you can set a deadline outlining a date by when you want to see changes in this area then you might focus on sticking with these changes tracking

to achieve each goal if at first you don t succeed reschedule or decide to try a different goal for a while get an occupation or hobby if you already have one try something new that you might not have considered before things like writing dancing or acting are all good examples joining a sports team or club is also a great way to have a good time and meet new people put yourself out there become interested in other peoples hobbies ask them questions look for the most boring thing you waste your time on and replace it with something new that you always wanted to be able to do never mind whether you re any good at it most things especially creative activities you get better at it with practice don t get scared to learn unless you have a physical reason you d never succeed at it try something new at your scale with beginner classes projects and activities rather than expecting brilliant professional results the first time you try if you do any better than totally hopeless you re way ahead and probably talented if your start is totally hopeless study it online or with people who already do it well and see how well your next attempt goes celebrate even minor successes in the new activity don t pay too much attention to failures it s more important to pay attention to the successes in trial and error that s how people learn that s why artists start with sketchbooks and practice paper if you re not a sporty person try learning an instrument or even a new language you ll meet new friends with similar interests and have something interesting to talk to people about become a more passionate and charismatic person go out and learn about various different subjects read books or watch films and see what kind of things interest you dedicate yourself to something you care about and learn as much about that thing as you can get out there and try something new work with other people volunteer at a charity help out in the community whatever you do it will make an impact think back when was the last time in my life i was actually happy this can help lead you to things which you may have forgotten you could do but where there all along talk to people that you wouldn t normally talk to be outgoing and social and make new friends socialize and make conversation with new people if you and your friends are going to the movies or out somewhere ask other people to tag along the more the merrier re arrange your usual schedule if you do things at the same time every day just move them about a bit start an interesting and rewarding project get a part time job or a completely different wardrobe or hairstyle make a movie or start a blog or a website there are so many things to do if you re fond of writing then you can write some articles maybe even on wiki how you can even maybe try a hand with writing some poems or any other intellectual hobbies do what you always wanted to do and try to do as many new things as possible don t know how to play a really cool sport that you love to watch try it out find someone and find time to teach play and practice with you it s always good to try new things at your comfortable rate hang out with other people if you feel like your life is boring it might have something to do with the crowd you are hanging around don t just forget your old friends but branch out a little you ll be glad you did get wild spice up your life by going to exotic places cultivating amazing plants raising an odd and quirky animal just let your imagination explode and you ll live a more exciting and rewarding life look fear in the eye know by this i don t mean jump off a building without a parachute but do the things you re kind of nervous doing like for example talk to a girl or boy dance try to crack a joke or even stand up for someone else don t be a hermit crab get out there who knows it could get you friends just don t be stupid make the right choices are you happy doing with what you do or with your friends maybe it s not the right thing you can experiment with different things to see if anything brings you more joy go with a friend to a concert or a movie if they ask you but don t do crimes they re always wrong put yourself out there if you are lonely then put yourself on the market for a new friend or group be interesting while doing the things you love try doing it differently life is good especially with friends don t forget romance either if he she is solo then try charming him her with your traits life is good when you get noticed and get friends look on the positive side of things if you re going to a boring place look on the bright side if you re going shopping and you don t like to shop look at the bright side at least you have food to eat change sometimes you just need a healthy change to break the monotony dying your hair or throwing a party with parents permission or taking a holiday or trying a new hobby are great ways to do this start to flirt with girls guys it s a fun thing to do that gets you noticed and girls boys love it when you return the favor sometimes it s good to be spontaneous talk to the person in front of you in the grocery line or introduce yourself to the jogger in the street you never know what might become of it do something you have never done before it s good to try new things you can even make a new hobby out of it maybe something your friends family does that you haven t and if you don t like it no harm done you ll probably end up making new friends if you stick with it keep a diary it s a great idea to scribble down your thoughts from time to time you don t have to write inside it everyday just whenever you feel like it one day you ll be able to look back on the things you wrote if you don t know how to start you can invite your friends to sleep over but firstly you have to ask your parents about it hope your life is going to turn interesting and nice wish you the best in your trying don t try to change your image to be accepted into a club or sport make a bucket list try to actually do the things you write down to remember you only live once make the most of your time while you can join a class for example if you are interested in dance then join a dance class and improve your dancing skills hang out with friends it s always very interesting to be out with friends give yourself a total make over don t be afraid to experiment and have fun because if you didn t like the way you were before then odds are you will like something new i wouldn t go overboard for example going into a goth look if your naturally a preppy person etc go brunette or blonde maybe get a super curly perm or go for a pin straight look or let your hair out naturally if you hadn t before remember to be yourself and stay true to yourself there is nothing worse than a hypocrite do something for a cause support a charity like the wwf world wildlife fund it ll make you feel good and lastly your love life if you are single and you have a crush on someone take a risk and ask them out if you have a boyfriend girlfriend take it to the next level go outside more the more you spend outside the more people you will meet the more you meet the more likely you get more friends to share your hobbies with if you are single start to talk more with girls guys as mentioned before get out of that shell and go out and talk to different people you might even like to travel around a country for a certain period of time step out of your comfort zone do something different think of something you ve always wanted to do and just do it like a holiday or an activity build something building can be very fun if you like it try going out and buying some legos or wood if you don t think legos are age appropriate try to do what they like if it s a boy start acting like a tom boy zombies shooting etc or if it s a girl start acting a little girly to try to find something you have in common find ways your interests and theirs may overlap if you two like the same things they ll think your life is more interesting a little girly could mean adding a hair ribbon or reading a book she loved a little tomboyish could mean finding a videogame with more gender friendly characters to share with your brother or boyfriend look for things neither of you have tried that might be fun especially if they involve doing something rather than just consuming stuff this is true for guys too you don t need to be nailed to one small group s idea of masculinity the more you stretch to explore things gals like the more likely you ll find your life richer by more female friends and more chances at a genuinely interesting girlfriend there are worse ways to spend a saturday morning than hanging around in a kitchen cooking something tasty with a woman and if you do learn you not only get to eat it but you ll eat better living on your own let the other one do what they want to do don t suggest things good ex what do you wanna do i don t know let s play monopoly sure bad ex let s play candy land always let them decide what to do do something risky or try something interesting and dangerous like bmx or something crazy like sky diving or fire breathing with supervision if all else fails make a list of 5 things you have always wanted to do e g walk up mount snow don and each 6 months you have to go down the list and do these things no excuses be different do your own thing get attention and be the life of the party no drugs or drinking where ever you go feel free but not too free and don t be annoying or insulting while you do it be friendly and nice and try not to be loud then you ll just be some weird goof and make sure you don t hurt yourself live everyday like a day you want to remember it saying that seems impossible how can you actually remember everyday of your life but to have an interesting life you have to do interesting things and be interesting after all we only have one life remember to laugh even when everything seems to be going wrong all you can really do is laugh it off calm down and don t get too overwhelmed by the moment because it will pass life is not a bed of roses like people usually say there are more days when we are stressed than days when we are actually relaxed and have everything we need so changing your life is never going to happen overnight no matter how bad we want it to so realistically i could tell you get a hobby play a new instrument learn a language but everybody knows that all that is far fetched because yes you would like to do all those but your daily routine would most likely always be your daily routine because that s your survival mode you don t eat if you don t work you don t get your degree or diploma if you don t go to school so what is being said is that all of the new and exciting thing being discussed is for you to make a gradual adjustment in your life if you really want to learn a new language or play a new instrument put your deadline for 6 8months not 2weeks that gives you process to adjusting to the change and it lets you enjoy and embrace the change to fit your already set lifestyle you want change to occur in your life you have to pick what you want to change and keep it slow and steady be consistent that is the only way to see results that you seek any change that occurs fast or overnight never lasts because it took you your lifetime to get to that point so how will it take you overnight to make a change after all have fun even if there is nobody around for example listen to music and dance the way nobody has danced ever before sing in the shower as loud as possible write your funny memories watch movies cook and whatever you love to do or it s fun to you,Work-World

how to keep a life changing resolution,at the beginning of each year many people make a decision to seek a fresh start the new year is a great time to commit to a life changing resolution such as becoming healthier finding a new career paying more heed to your close relationships and so forth yet making the resolution is one thing sticking to it is quite another and many people fail to follow through to the commitment s end to increase your chances of keeping your life changing resolution here are some simple ways to increase your chances,rekindle your inner imp who says the better you is your stuffy self all prim and proper with so many edicts to behave yourself sometimes there s a risk you ll equate being better with conforming to some highly unrealistic standard planted in your head by confused media messages yes it is important to eat healthily exercise and quit bad habits but equally moderation requires that you accept yourself and let go of any scolding approach to self improvement when you let out the silly sassy playfully mischievous and audacious person within you reveal your true colors you can accomplish anything as long as you drop the fault finding and look for all that s right with you be non committal play with marvelous ideas for a bit half of the stuff we say we will do we never actually plan on really doing all the promises you feel obligated to do will be completely trashed within the first week because you resent them rather than treating your resolutions as absolute commitments try something novel consider them as trials try them on for size to see if they fit you may find that the harsh exercise regime is actually wrong for your body type while forgoing those chocolates is a sure way to end up eating more of them give yourself the wriggle room to ease into change bit by bit gradual change is likely to last long term because you re buying into it and remember you can do anything set your mind to once you really want to meanwhile play until you feel the time is right much advice on making resolutions suggest you commit publicly while this may shame you into making changes that s really not a good basis for making a change you must want to shift your old self into a new self and revealing your intentions to other people can open you up to naysayers getting picked on when your progress seems slower than expected or having people give a ton of unwanted advice the better approach is to zip it show an enigmatic smile if anyone questions your intentions and simply let the internal commitment motivate you in its own way instead acknowledge that you re complex there is a tendency to feel that the old you has to be shown the door and the new you will miraculously be much better yet it s both unrealistic to expect such a dramatic transformation and it s a denial of the reality that you re already a complex being with many facets which part of yourself are you challenging to change you ll need to think of the trigger situations or people who bring out the facets of yourself that you re not so proud of rather than assuming a one size solution will create change hence a renowned diet may sound great but unless you face the reason why you overeat eat the wrong sorts of foods or fail to exercise that diet resolution is doomed only you know yourself well enough to face the deeper truths live in a land of conundrums many resolutions tend to be all or nothing black and white and this tends to be why they re set to fail so rather than stating i intend to stop eating fried food forever and assuming you will stick to this strict finality give yourself the freedom to mix and match solutions that even each other out and restore the fun in life slow down and pick up the pace try yoga and drink triple lattes let your childlike wisdom shine try modern urban rustic decoration be a modern minimalist multi tasker drink nonalcoholic beer experiment with the extremes and see what marvelous moments you come up with be unrealistic being realistic limits your options and tends to keep you in the zone of that ll never work a place most people stay in you won t change when you re too invested in worrying about what might go wrong or what might hurt you to get beyond this impasse think bigger about the world than you ever have before go outside your comfort zone dream beyond your expectations you have miraculous abilities to accomplish all you desire so passionately dream and dream some more in vivid technicolor if possible keep dreaming until you have considered every imaginable possibility that thrills you some of it may well be too fantastical but within your dreaming solid and workable ideas and plans will form finally you ll feel empowered by the process steal resources why recreate the wheel just find all the people around you who have achieved the same or similar goals find out what worked for them and what didn t try their solutions on for size add plenty of personal modifications so the color style and habits fit you like a glove following in the footsteps of others is a tremendous way of enhancing your own talents and ideas to reinvent and to make new discoveries from your own perspective knowing what others know is an investment in yourself never before have so many people had so many opportunities to learn from skillful inspiring intelligent interesting and innovative people than in our era of the internet you can find out about almost any public figure you admire through video lectures websites and other online resources what are you waiting for get busy resolutions lack spine if you fail to act they ll flop about in your gray matter turning into sources of resentment when you ignore the work needed to implement them make the effort in small ways getting started gives your resolution life and gives you motivation and be very careful not to let resolutions turn into vague affirmations sitting around all day telling yourself that things are going to change and get better won t bring the universe to you get up get going and something will happen in the doing throw your arms up give in and give up it s the stress and strain that s got your panties in a bunch without the worry and sense of urgency that comes from impatience perfectionism and over attachment to single issues you can do some pretty fierce stuff you always got great results in the past when you were free flowing energized and in the moment let go now and see what happens be selfish give yourself unadulterated permission to think about you and only you

they are labelled well and clear to the customer 7 x research source the delivery fee may be taxed if you have sales tax in your area so you can charge taxes on it after you create a subtotal however always check with an accountant to make sure you are charging taxes correctly 8 x research source create a subtotal add up all the charges that you have on the invoice put it in a line below the services as the subtotal with the label subtotal it s the subtotal because you still need to add tax in 9 x research source add the taxes next calculate the taxes put the tax rate below the subtotal

copy filed away if you have any emails memos or other documents related to an invoice you should store those alongside a printed copy of the invoice as well add payment options your customer needs to know what methods they can use to pay do you accept checks can the customer pay by credit card cash or other payment processing system if the only way the customer can pay is to come into your store

before a final payment notice is up to you it s important to reiterate you have a payment plan option if you re willing to let the client pay it out over time once you ve sent out as many as you re willing you can send out the final payment notice that lets the client know you re turning it over to a lawyer or collection agency 21 x research source to establish a system try having specific collection actions spaced out regularly across your collections period for example try sending notices after the balance has gone unpaid for 15 days 30 days 45 days and so on each can specify how many days are left until payment and what actions will be taken if the balances goes unpaid try sending at least one notice by certified mail so you know the client received it,Work-World

how to write a freelance contract,freelance work is common in a range of industries from entertainment to landscaping if you re a freelancer you need to understand how to draw up a contract that protects both you and your client freelancing contracts provide clear guidance concerning the work to be performed and the compensation that will be paid for that work before performing any service for a client it is important that a freelancer have the client s signature on a contract obligating them to pay a certain fee for the services in a specific manner and period remember that the

clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract contractor will help client throw a party is too broad will you provide food and music or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services will you hire crew to set up the party and or provide cleanup you need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do you could write contractor will organize client s party by hiring caterers musicians florists and crew to perform set up and take down

example of general terms as opposed to specific would be to say paralegal services secretarial services or consulting instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal secretary or consultant using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract thereby reducing errors and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client attach project

not provide any fringe benefits including health insurance paid vacation or any other benefits for contractor 4 x research source outline a project schedule where applicable the contract should lay out the steps and expected time frames for the project a web development contract for example might specify development milestones and testing and acceptance periods a sample project schedule could

product you create produce or invent forms recipes research memorandum graphics and software are generally owned by the client you want to be clear and specific about who owns what including but not limited to is a good phrase to use in this section of the contract for example all documents produced by contractor including but not limited to memorandum research notes correspondence e mails

confidentiality clause if you will be performing services that make you privy to information that is confidential such as legal or medical files secret formulas or recipes or a client s financial or

how to write an invoice for payment for services rendered,if you work as an independent contractor or own a small company that performs a specialized service the odds are that you will need to learn how to write an invoice for services rendered so you can be paid the information you need to include on an invoice varies depending on the specific services you perform but most invoices should include your contact information along with some other basic header information an invoice should also include a listing of the services rendered for your client within the billing period as well as the sum total owed to you,put your company s name at the top to be professional you start with your company s information at the top of the page if you don t have a company name just start with your name at the top it can be centered or all the way over to the left 1 x research source treat the invoice like a business letter that is you can have a professional header at the top centered in the middle on the other hand a simple statement of your business name is also effective add your contact information put your address phone number email and any other relevant contact information make sure to use your business information not your personal information 2 x research source a fax number may also be relevant if you accept payment services like paypal be sure to use the email you have set up with that account add the addressee s name or business just like with a business letter you now move on to the person you re billing if it s a business use the business address and contact information that the company gave you if it s a person use what information you have but preferably their business contact information if you don t have enough information you may need to contact the person or business with the information you do have to find out more 3 x research source if it s a large company you may want to call anyway to ask exactly who to address the invoice to include a customer account number create a unique identification number for each of your repeat customers then make sure that this number is included on every invoice that you write for this customer this will allow you to group invoices by customer and if necessary assess their payment history or document a consistent failure to pay list a unique invoice number near the top if you re sending out invoices on a regular basis it s important that each one has a unique number so it s easy to reference and identify how you choose a number is up to you but remember that you must have a new one for each invoice 4 x research source one simple way is to just start out at one and work your way up to keep the length of the number uniform you could start with 0000001 5 x research source another method is to assign a customer number and then use the date for instance if the customer number is 305 and the date is february 2 2016 you could use 305 02022016 as your number just make sure you re clear on what the date should be is it when the service was rendered or when you created the invoice include the invoice date near the top put the label invoice date next to it add the date that you are creating the invoice this helps both you and the customer keep track of the time you can also include the billing period the billing period is based on how you set up your invoicing for instance if you invoice once a month that means your billing period is from the beginning of the month to the end of the month and the services you performed during that period will be included on the invoice list the services you provided this step is the meat of the invoice you re telling your customer what you re charging and why you are charging it it s important to not have surprises at this step so make sure you are upfront with your client at all times 6 x research source organize by date if this invoice is for more than one date it s easiest to organize by date put the date all the way to the left either way you need to include the date the service was rendered list the service next to it list the amount you charge per hour or per service you ll also need the number of hours or the number of times the service was performed finally put the total for that particular service over to the right in the charges column create a new line for each type of service list other charges relevant for service such as charges for parts add any other fees if you have a delivery fee you add it at the end since it s not a part of the service you can also add any other fees you need to just make sure they are labelled well and clear to the customer 7 x research source the delivery fee may be taxed if you have sales tax in your area so you can charge taxes on it after you create a subtotal however always check with an accountant to make sure you are charging taxes correctly 8 x research source create a subtotal add up all the charges that you have on the invoice put it in a line below the services as the subtotal with the label subtotal it s the subtotal because you still need to add tax in 9 x research source add the taxes next calculate the taxes put the tax rate below the subtotal labelled as the tax rate if you don t know the tax rate in your area contact your local sales tax authorities to find out the number 10 x research source you can also look online to find the sale tax or contact your accountant in some states you won t need to charge sales tax for services check your local laws to find out whether you need to charge it in your area also it may very by the type of business for instance you may not need to charge sales tax if you re a nonprofit it also may depend on whether the primary object of the sale is the service such as at the dentist or the equipment such as in computer repair 11 x research source taxes are usually charged in the place the service was performed so if you go to a customer s place of residence in a suburb you must use that city s sales tax however again always check your local laws 12 x research source sales tax is a percentage to figure out the tax you multiply the subtotal by percentage expressed as a decimal for instance if your total is 50 and the sales tax is 8 25 you multiply 50 by 0 0825 to get 4 125 round the number off as needed here the tax would be 4 13 add the tax in next you add the number you got to the original subtotal in the example you add 4 13 to 50 to get the grand total of 54 13 13 x research source create the total finally list the total amount you just found put total next to it to make it clear also it doesn t hurt to put a box around the total or to mark the final total in bold 14 x research source keep a thorough record of your invoices it is best to have a digital copy and a printed copy filed away if you have any emails memos or other documents related to an invoice you should store those alongside a printed copy of the invoice as well add payment options your customer needs to know what methods they can use to pay do you accept checks can the customer pay by credit card cash or other payment processing system if the only way the customer can pay is to come into your store in person let them know that other options include mailing in a payment either check or credit card number calling in a payment credit card number or paying online 15 x research source include a due date your customer needs to know when they need to pay the invoice by include a due date prominently on your invoice you can even include it more than once one place to include it is down near the total amount due but at the top is also a good option 16 x research source payment should always have a due date with a consequence if not met for example interest charged on late payments you might also include an incentive for early payment like a 2 discount if paid in ten days since most small businesses have constant cash flow problems you should also discuss whether you have a payment plan option you can include the information with the letter or write something like if you can t pay your bill all at once call our office to set up a payment plan 17 x research source send the invoice once you re done creating the invoice send it to your client it will let your client know they need to pay what is owed you make sure to make your company s name prominent on the outside of the envelop 18 x research source invoices should be coordinated with accounting system an invoice once written becomes an asset of the company accounts receivable and should be properly recorded if you use accounting software you may have the option to let the software create an invoice for you 19 x research source services like paypal also have built in invoice creation 20 x research source collect on your invoices if you don t get a response from the customer after sending your invoice try making a phone call to make sure the invoice was received another option is emailing the client a reminder it s important to have a well defined and standardized collections process so that you can more easily collect on your invoices you can also send out reminders through the mail how many you send out before a final payment notice is up to you it s important to reiterate you have a payment plan option if you re willing to let the client pay it out over time once you ve sent out as many as you re willing you can send out the final payment notice that lets the client know you re turning it over to a lawyer or collection agency 21 x research source to establish a system try having specific collection actions spaced out regularly across your collections period for example try sending notices after the balance has gone unpaid for 15 days 30 days 45 days and so on each can specify how many days are left until payment and what actions will be taken if the balances goes unpaid try sending at least one notice by certified mail so you know the client received it,Work-World

for your design the scale dictates the sizing measurements for the entire blueprint 3 x research source for example you could choose 1 8 inch 0 32 cm to represent 1 foot 0 30 m stick to the scale that you set for the whole design lay a 24 by 36 in 61 by 91 cm sheet of tracing paper on a poster board the poster board will act as a base for you to draw your blueprints on the tracing paper place the

clearly insert symbols for appliances plumbing and electrical outlets if you plan to add appliances plumbing fixtures like cabinets and counters or electrical outlets add symbols for them into your blueprint that way you can be sure there s enough room for them in the space they should be represented by simple but recognizable representations make sure you draw them to scale in the spaces label the symbols so it s easy to tell what they are you can also add symbols for furniture or anything you plan to put in the room finish the blueprint by adding dimension lines the last thing you need to do is draw lines to indicate the lengths of the design elements start with the walls by adding lines about 5 inches 1 3 cm from the edges of the walls in each room to show their length then add another line about 1 in 2 5 cm from the exterior walls to show the total length add dimension lines for every room window closet cabinets and any appliances that you ve added to your blueprint

can think of that a full time employee would receive consultants are most often going to be categorized as independent contractors this ensures that the company or the individual hiring the consultant has a minimum level of responsibility over the consultant this can be a good thing and it often means there will be less hoops to jump through in order to start and maintain the contractual relationship i e less tax and reporting responsibilities for instance if you characterize the consultant as an independent contractor the independent contractor may not have to report their income up to a certain amount to the irs for tax purposes define the length of the contractual agreement here you will include a section defining when the consulting services will begin and when they will end an acceptable provision may state the term of this agreement will begin on the date of this agreement and will remain in full force and effect until the completion of the services subject to earlier termination as provided in this agreement the term of this agreement may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties 11 x research source write a termination provision this section will provide information on how you can terminate the agreement before the total completion of services include how much notice will have to be given and how termination will affect compensation for example your provision may end up looking like this this agreement may be terminated by either party with or without cause upon thirty 30 days prior written notice to the other provided that if consultant terminates this agreement consultant shall in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof nevertheless wind up in an orderly fashion assignments for the customer which consultant began prior to the date of notice of termination hereunder upon termination of this agreement for any reason consultant shall be entitled to receive such compensation and reimbursement if any accrued under the terms of this agreement but unpaid as of the date consultant ceases work under this agreement in addition consultant shall be reimbursed for any non cancellable obligations any cancellation penalties and unless consultant terminates the agreement without cause any expenditures reasonably made in order to perform the services that were to occur had cancellation not occurred 12 x research source include any miscellaneous information and boilerplate provisions towards the end of your contract you will include any standard provisions that are usually found in contracts most of these provisions you can simply take from a form contract you find but make sure you read over them and ensure they say what you want them to some of these provisions may include severability provisions modification provisions indemnification provisions choice of law provisions entire agreement provisions make an area for signatures at the very end of the contract you will make space for all parties to sign the contract this area should have spaces for your signatures and dates offer your contract to the other party once you have written your consulting contract you will offer it to the other party the other party will then have a number of options the other party may accept the offer in full in this instance you will then sign the contract and start performing the other party could reject the offer in full if this is the case you will have to write a more acceptable contract to the other party or find someone else to try to contract with the other party might try to negotiate some of the terms of your contract if this happens you will negotiate with the other party until you both reach an acceptable agreement negotiate any differences about the terms of your contract when you negotiate over the terms of your consulting contract it will most likely be over payment for services and or the types of services the consultant is going to perform these will be common areas of tension because they are the main parts of your contract sign your contract and begin performing when you and the other party are satisfied with the document you will both sign it and begin performance in the manner you both agreed upon,Work-World
how to create a consulting proposal,a consulting proposal is a document sent from a consultant to a prospective client describing a job they wish to take on and the conditions under which they will do so consulting proposals are usually written only after the consultant and prospective client have discussed the job at length knowing how to write a clear effective proposal can help land new clients for your practice so it s an essential skill for all independent consultants,learn as much as you can about the job under consideration a consulting proposal isn t like a resume it s not a good idea to just send yours out to as many recipients as possible to drum up business each proposal should be tailored specifically to the client you re trying to get the more knowledgeable you are about the client and his or her needs the better you can write your proposal so your first step should always be to educate yourself 1 x research source there are many ways you might do this the best and most direct is simply to meet with the client and discuss the proposed job take careful notes and ask lots of specific questions so you understand precisely what the work entails after this you can follow up with phone calls and emails to clarify any lingering questions as you write the proposal see below it may be useful to do a little independent research as for example if you re trying to prove why your services will help your client succeed finding business surveys that support your point is a good idea come to an agreement on what your exact role will be you don t want to sign on to work as a consultant only to have your client pressure into doing work you didn t agree to having a very clear picture of what the client expects from you is important this way you can word your proposal so that your work will be limited only to what has been agreed upon things to note include your precise duties and the result the client hopes to achieve the time frame for your work specific milestones that need to be reached by certain dates sometimes you may need to speak to multiple people for example if you are hoping to consult about a dispute between management and employees it would be wise to speak to representatives of both parties as well as the hiring client find the client s financial commitment this is perhaps the most important piece of information of all if the client isn t willing to pay you what you think the work is worth you don t even need to bother writing the proposal have an agreement with the client about how much as well as how often you will be paid before you start writing this way you can refer to the agreed upon payment in your proposal which the client will need to sign and agree to to hire you in addition to the fee for your services you also want to come to an agreement with the client about secondary costs that you may have while working e g gasoline supplies travel etc it s in your best interest to get the client to agree to compensate you for these things do not write a consulting proposal if the client seems uncertain about how much you will be paid or when if possible get the work without a proposal lots of consultant resources will offer advice along the lines of it s easier to write a confirmation of services than a proposal of services 2 x research source keep in mind that a consulting proposal is just that a proposal that doesn t guarantee you any work it s perfectly possible for a client to solicit proposals from many different consultants and pick just one so if you can try to get the client to agree to hire you before you even write the proposal this way when you send it the client will just be confirming that you can start working not deciding whether or not you can begin your proposal by addressing the prospective client start your proposal like you would start a letter with a short paragraph summing up that you want to do the work for the client and that you are the best candidate for the job you ll get to the specifics later here it s ok to be somewhat warm and personal in your tone though you should always stay professional 3 x research source mention the client by name if you re on friendly names first names are fine otherwise use mr or mrs you re trying to show the client that this proposal is specifically tailored to him or her see our sample documents below for specific examples of what s needed in each proposal describe the job in the first paragraph draw from the discussions you have already had regarding the job to show your client in a few sentences that you know what you need to do show that you understand the problem that needs solving the duties the client expects you to perform and the scope of your work one time gig long term etc 4 x research source be specific about the job here but don t dwell on precise details like money hours and so on you ll get to this later in the second paragraph describe your qualifications here you re trying to sell yourself as the best possible person for the job draw attention to things like your training your experience and jobs you ve done in the past that have gotten positive feedback you can also reference your attitude and values though these should take a back seat to more concrete qualifications remember that you may be in competition with other consultants try to paint a picture of how you will provide a measurable benefit to the client in terms of money or time saved this way you can give yourself an edge over a competitor with similar or better qualifications who doesn t articulate this as well in the next paragraph describe the work you propose list using strict terminology and specific details what you will do to solve the client s problem pinpoint the exact results the client will see from you consultation be specific regarding your methods and time frame here to avoid problems later it s also wise to describe what you expect from the client during your work with regards to personnel access to work sites and equipment for example name people that you expect to work with full time list the sectors that you will have access to etc 5 x research source describe what you will not be doing during your consultation as a consultant you want to avoid the problem of mission creep gradually having your responsibilities grow without receiving any extra compensation 6 x research source isolate the problem you will be addressing and indicate very clearly that related issues are not included in this proposal a good way to present this is in a bulleted list this makes it very hard for the client to miss the relevant information propose a price for your consultation this depends on what you are doing and who your client is remember that you may be competing against other consultants so try to keep your rate competitive for your industry and your situation you will also want to describe any extra costs such as meals hotel rooms transportation etc that the prospective client will have to pay for you having an approval process in place is a good idea for example you may specify that you will present your receipts at the end of every month this makes it harder for the client to refuse paying you with the reasoning that they never agreed to pay this much close by summarizing your proposal like in an academic essay the goal of the concluding paragraph is to offer a quick succinct summary of the rest of the proposal was about reiterate your fitness for the job your preparations for the consultation and your confidence in attaining results here as in the opening paragraph you can be a little more warm and refer to the client by name 7 x research source when you re finished sign and date the proposal leaving a space for the client s signature stay short and sweet keep your proposal as short as it needs to be to accurately describe yourself and the job quality is your goal here not quantity any excuse the client has to stop reading your proposal and pick up another consultant s is something you want to prevent so make your proposal a quick read for most jobs two pages is a fine proposal length if you refer to lengthy datasets in your proposal attach them in appendices to keep the length of the actual proposal down keep your focus on the client while you ll always want to devote some space to your qualifications the most important person in the proposal isn t you it s your client even when you re talking about yourself frame your discussion in terms of how well you meet the client s needs not how great you are avoid lengthy discussions of your work history or your firm s if you re not an independent consultant avoid buzzwords many clients corporate clients especially spend all day hearing empty meaningless phrases parroted by people trying to sound important spare them this unnecessary tedium instead write your proposal with clear succinct language don t try to make your promises sound more exciting than they are with flashy jargon instead just make exciting promises examples of buzzwords include things like best practices synergy disruptive optimized and more each industry has its own these words have effectively lost any power they once had from overuse and vague application pay attention to spelling and grammar this may seem nit picky but it s essential even if you re not consulting for a position that requires any writing clean professional communication shows that you ve taken the time and energy to present your best self mistakes don t mean you re less qualified for the job but they do mean that you didn t pay enough attention to get your proposal exactly right in a tight competition between two consultants this may be the deciding factor after you finish your proposal be sure to go over it a second time editing for grammar and fluency if you have time let a friend or family member edit it as well they re more likely to see mistakes you ve missed since they weren t actually involved in writing it,Work-World

that doesn t exist yet you have to go out and get it that may seem a little strange but it s up to you to convince the company that you re the right person for the job to do this seize opportunities

how to write a freelance contract,freelance work is common in a range of industries from entertainment to landscaping if you re a freelancer you need to understand how to draw up a contract that protects both you and your client freelancing contracts provide clear guidance concerning the work to be performed and the compensation that will be paid for that work before performing any service for a client it is important that a freelancer have the client s signature on a contract obligating them to pay a certain fee for the services in a specific manner and period remember that the contract needn t be overly complicated what s important is that it s clear specific and thorough 1 x research source,create a title for your contract the title should be descriptive of the agreement for example independent consulting independent contractor agreement or freelance web design contract center your title in bold type at the top of the contract like this independent contractor agreement name the parties to the contract after each name include the title by which you will refer to that party throughout the contract if dealing with a business include its full legal name with the inc or llc suffix do not include the names of the individuals signing the contract on behalf of that business 2 x research source here are two examples this independent contractor agreement agreement is made and entered into by and between john doe contractor and jane smith client john doe contractor and jane smith client agree as follows provide a description of services the length of the description will depend on the complexity of the job there is no reason to make the description more complicated than necessary nevertheless you should define the scope of work with sufficient clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract contractor will help client throw a party is too broad will you provide food and music or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services will you hire crew to set up the party and or provide cleanup you need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do you could write contractor will organize client s party by hiring caterers musicians florists and crew to perform set up and take down contractor will also supervise these same sometimes a short description will work this works best for businesses that provide services that can be summarized in a brief paragraph for example a social media consultant might describe the job as follows setting up and maintaining social media accounts for client with facebook twitter and linkedin developing and implementing social advertising campaign and training current staff to continue with social marketing efforts if you can use a short description then you might want to type contractor will provide client with the following services and then leave some blank lines or space by doing this you can reuse the same contract for multiple jobs with each new job you can just type or write in the description do not be overly detailed if it isn t necessary some tasks are self explanatory if you are confident there will be no dispute over what work is to be performed you may want to use general terms for this section of the contract an example of general terms as opposed to specific would be to say paralegal services secretarial services or consulting instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal secretary or consultant using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract thereby reducing errors and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client attach project plans and specifications for highly technical work if you provide a service that relies heavily on technical or design specifications describing a project in your freelancing contract may mean your contract is several pages long and changes drastically from one client to the next for services such as this you may want to describe the job as providing client with services described in the attached project plan by doing this you can then attach each client s personal project plan to his or her contract using this format gives you the flexibility of describing each job in detail without having to change your entire contract for each new job specify compensation include the compensation you will receive and in what manner and time frame it is due you may choose to use either flat or hourly rate methods or include both for example client shall pay contractor _____ per hour due on or before the first friday following the end of any week in which contractor performs services for company client shall pay contractor a flat fee of __________ as total compensation for the project described below payment shall be made as follows a _________ due before work will begin and b

in the manner of your choosing 3 x research source because employees and contract workers are treated differently for tax purposes a description of the working relationship will help ensure that no mistake is made regarding whether you are a freelancer or an employee sample language could be it is understood that contractor is an independent contractor and not an employee of client client will not provide any fringe benefits including health insurance paid vacation or any other benefits for contractor 4 x research source outline a project schedule where applicable the contract should lay out the steps and expected time frames for the project a web development contract for example might specify development milestones and testing and acceptance periods a sample project schedule could say benchmarks contractor agrees to provide first drafts by august 22 2015 after approval of the draft and input from client contractor will then provide an updated draft within two weeks of receiving input from client agree to circumstances for termination of the contract it may be helpful to specify on what grounds either party could terminate the contract such as missed deadlines or missed payments in this case the party has the right to terminate the contract without violating the contract 5 x research source for example you could add in the event of a material breach of the contract either party has the right to terminate this contract within 14 days of notice of the breach by the non breaching party client may also terminate the contract immediately in its sole discretion in the event contractor breaches the confidentiality clause 6 x research source or revise this language to reflect the grounds for termination that you and the client agree to describe who will own any product you create produce or invent forms recipes research memorandum graphics and software are generally owned by the client you want to be clear and specific about who owns what including but not limited to is a good phrase to use in this section of the contract for example all documents produced by contractor including but not limited to memorandum research notes correspondence e mails pleadings and reports in the course of his work for client shall be the property of client and contractor shall retain no ownership interest or rights therein determine if you will need a confidentiality clause if you will be performing services that make you privy to information that is confidential such as legal or medical files secret formulas or recipes or a client s financial or personal information you should include a confidentiality clause a typical confidentiality clause contains the definition of confidential information prohibits disclosure generally identifies exceptions such as disclosure required by law and states the duration of the confidentiality obligation for example contractor acknowledges that he she may be furnished with information relating to client s products vendor lists creative works business or marketing strategies pending projects and other confidential information contractor agrees not to disclose this confidential information unless required by law or court order this duty to maintain confidentiality shall continue throughout the life of the contract include a choice of law clause you should specify which law will govern the contract generally people choose the laws of the contractor s state of residence but you could also choose the client s state laws choose one state only and specify where you will mediate arbitrate or bring legal actions under the contract should a dispute arise 7 x research source a choice of law clause may look like this governing law this agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the united states of america and by the laws of the state of indiana each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in indiana as applicable for any matter arising out of or relating to this agreement except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of such federal or state courts located in indiana such personal jurisdiction shall be nonexclusive include a severability clause a severability clause provides that if any of the terms of the contract are found to be unenforceable by a court all other terms shall remain operative a severability clause may look like this severability if any provision of this agreement is held by a court of law to be illegal invalid or unenforceable a that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision and b the legality validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby describe specific relief for breach service contracts commonly contain a specific relief clause which allows client to seek an injunction a judicial order that either restrains or compels specific action should the contractor attempt to disclose confidential information in breach of a term of the contract it may also include an order for a specific performance should the contractor refuse to perform some duty under the contract which causes the client irreparable harm a specific relief for breach clause may look like this injunctive relief for breach contractor agrees that his obligations under this agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value contractor s breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to client for which there will be no adequate remedy at law and in the event of such breach client will be entitled to injunctive relief and or a decree for specific performance and such other and further relief as may be proper including monetary damages if appropriate include the date this should be the date the parties will sign the contract if you are unsure of the exact date leave a blank line where necessary so that the day month and or year can be hand written in when you execute the contract for example agreed to this ___ day of february 2008 create a signature block each party should have a line to sign on plenty of room to sign his or her title listed and his or her typed name below the line format your contract each section of your contract

the contractor 18 x research source the letter could state that you the contractor agreed to undertake work according to the contract but as of yet have failed to do so try to be as specific as

contract 19 x research source if the foreman you have been working with is a member of staff at a larger company it might be appropriate to address the letter to somebody more senior if the contractor

position a street promoter position is usually in demand and is the type of position that it makes sense for you to apply in person for because most brands want someone with a certain look for their street teams applying in person can allow them to see you for themselves visit the office of the business or organization that you d like to work for and ask if they have any open street promoter positions 4 x research source try calling the office ahead of your visit to make sure they allow visitors if the office is too far from you or they don t allow people to walk in for job requests try reaching out by phone or online be ready for an interview on the spot they may be in need of a street promoter so you should be prepared to interview for the job ask about perks and benefits of joining the street team many street promoter positions are volunteer based but may have room for you to be moved up into a paid position some positions are paid and require you to work a certain number of hours a week before you agree to anything ask about the job requirements and benefits 5 x research source ask about breaks and if they reimburse for food and gas find out if they provide any perks or benefits like free concert tickets or food see if there are any opportunities for advancement with the company complete any training programs that are required before you hit the streets to promote a brand or product you need to make sure you know everything you need to know in order to effectively do so proper training will tell you what your responsibilities are and how you need to behave while you re out promoting 6 x research source learn how to operate any vehicles hardware or devices that you ll be expected to use in the field complete any certifications that the brand or organization requires in order for you to be a street promoter some areas may not allow you to solicit without a certification or a permit which should be provided to you by the group you work for learn about the products or brand that you re promoting in order to effectively promote a product or brand you need to know as much about it as possible you will need to be able to answer questions and provide additional information to people when you re out on the streets 7 x research source research the market for the product that you ll be promoting so you re confident and knowledgeable know all of the prices of what you re promoting research your target demographic so you re able to appeal to them whether you re on the street getting the word out for an upcoming concert or you re promoting a company s new product line you need to know who it is you re trying to pitch it to research your audience so you can more effectively promote to the people who are more likely to respond positively 8 x research source ask the company about who you should promote to use your natural abilities to promote for example if you read a lot of fantasy fiction and you re promoting an author s new book use your knowledge to explain why this new book is interesting and how it compares to other books that you ve read wear clothing and accessories that advertise the brand people may not feel comfortable talking to somebody in regular clothes you need to look the part as a street promoter a t shirt jewelry hats or any other accessories that match the brand or product will immediately identify you as part of the street team 9 x research source for example if you re promoting an upcoming concert wear a t shirt with the band s name or logo on it your attire should correspond with what you re promoting for instance if you re promoting an upcoming punk rock show you wouldn t wear slacks and a button down dress shirt to engage people on the street put on a comfortable pair of shoes you ll be on your feet and walking around constantly as a street promoter so do yourself a favor and wear a comfortable pair of shoes you can t successfully promote on the street if people can see that you re uncomfortable or in pain 10 x research source your shoes should still be appropriate for what you re wearing and promoting you wouldn t wear a pair of white sneakers and slacks if you re promoting a business convention for example go to the places where you can find your target audience the best way to promote on the street is to be where the people you want to advertise to are allow the interactions to happen organically by placing yourself in a location that they ll pass by you and it s appropriate for you to engage with them 11 x research source for example if you re promoting a new flavor of soda it would make sense for you to promote the product outside of a grocery store people are already there to purchase food and drinks so they may be more receptive to your pitch promoting a new band or an upcoming concert by passing out flyers on the street is non invasive and gives people the option to engage with you or not don t hound people outside of their place of business or at their home or you could damage the image of your product or brand present all of the information about your product or brand clearly consumers are constantly being advertised to and may simply ignore or walk past you when you try to engage them in the street make your pitch or presentation short and sweet give them all of the information clearly and concisely and allow them to make the decision to learn more from you 12 x research source focus on the most important information about your product like its price benefits and reasons why its the best tell a story about what you re promoting to people once you have their attention add a personal connection to the product brand or event that you re promoting to engage with people on an emotional level tell them why it s important or effective to you by using a story to illustrate your point 13 x research source for example if you re promoting a healthy snack you can tell people about the health benefits it has given you or other people if you re getting the word out for a local band s new album tell people the inspiration behind the album and its significance to the band give out lots of samples and free swag if you have it hats bracelets or silly accessories are great ways to get people to talk to you it also helps further the brand or product because people are likely to take them home and show them to other people in addition giving out samples of your product for people to try is a great way to promote it 14 x research source you can also use swag to get people to do something for you for instance you can ask people something like hey would you like a free hat great i can give you one if you ll just fill out this quick survey if someone is reluctant to engage with you you can try to entice them with a free sample try saying something like hey grab yourself a free sample no pressure no pitch just let the product speak for itself give people a way to find out more information make sure people have a way to remember what you re promoting and a way they can seek out additional information give them the website information a business card pamphlet leaflet flyer or any other document that contains the necessary information for them to investigate on their own 15 x research source if they have a smartphone give them the social media information for your promotions giving people a way to follow up will boost engagement if they re hesitant to talk with you you can offer them a flyer or business card so they can look into it themselves if you have a table set up keep a stack of flyers on the table for easy access to anybody walking by,Work-World

how to make sure you get paid as a freelancer,freelancing has many benefits such as a flexible schedule and a variety of work however freelancers sometimes struggle to get paid to protect yourself you should carefully screen potential clients and weed out those who raise red flags remember to use a signed contract with the client and bill promptly,talk to other freelancers before agreeing to work for someone check around with other freelancers ask them if the client is good to work with do they pay on time are they reasonable in their demands do they sue at the drop of a hat during the interview stage you might ask who the client has worked with before then call those people up search online for reviews type the person s name into google and see what comes up another freelancer might have complained about working with this person 1 x research source if the client is a business you can check with the better business bureau for the city where they are located look for complaints realize that anyone can complain anonymously online so take complaints with a grain of salt nevertheless look for patterns have multiple people complained that the client doesn t pay their bill on time if so there s probably a problem study the client s website a client with a website that looks like it was created in the 1990s probably doesn t have a lot of money check how long they have been in business a more established company is probably a safer bet to do business with 2 x research source discuss your rates upfront you shouldn t hide how much you charge instead discuss your rates early in the interview process you won t know what to charge until you understand what the potential client wants so ask questions about the scope of the project and its deadline 3 x research source if your rates are inflexible then put them on a spreadsheet and give it to the potential client to look over they should know ahead of time whether they can afford you look for red flags there are some tell tale signs that a prospective client might be someone who flakes out and never pays you pay attention to the following 4 x research source the client doesn t know what they want you are courting disaster if you agree to work for this person chances are they ll change what they want midstream thus doubling your amount of work the client is disorganized you might ask for some information before agreeing to work for them if they never give it to you or if it is disorganized then steer clear the client is rude you re essentially a stranger at this point and someone who is rude to strangers will not make a good client the client objects to your rates you should charge what you are worth and be prepared to justify your rate if the client objects then don t work with them turn down a client gracefully when rejecting someone you don t want to burn any bridges it s possible that the client might become more reputable in the future and be someone you want to work with accordingly do the following 5 x research source decline with kindness thank someone for thinking of hiring you but say you are too busy right now or that you don t think you re a good fit offer alternatives recommend the person to a different freelancer or suggest ways the client can do the job themselves refuse to negotiate a client might try to get you to work for them by haggling stay firm and politely decline find sample contracts you should use contracts with all clients which will legally protect you if the client breaks the contract then you can sue search online to find a sample contract in your industry you can also hire a lawyer to draft a contract template for you 6 x research source you can use this contract over and over format your contract draft your own contract by opening a blank word processing document and setting the font to something legible such as times new roman 12 point at the top of the page include the title independent contractor agreement identify the parties at the beginning of the contract 7 x research source for example you can write this independent contractor agreement agreement is made between james jones contractor and elizabeth smith client who agree as follows if the client is a business then include the business name not the name of the person signing the contract on the business behalf describe your services in detail this is the heart of the contract describe the scope of the work you will perform so that the client understands what they are paying for provide as much detail as necessary but you don t have to be too detailed one option is to include a list of detailed services in an attachment in the contract itself you can simply write see attachment a for a full description of services be sure to identify the work that you won t be doing 8 x research source for example if you ve been hired as a wedding photographer you should clarify that you won t provide make up services identify compensation explain how much you charge and when the client needs to pay also explain when payment is late and whether you will assess a late fee or interest 9 x research source for example you can write client shall pay contractor 20 an hour due within 30 days of the invoice date if client is more than 10 days late with payment a 25 late fee will be assessed describe the project schedule if you re doing a large project for a client then you should identify the schedule and important benchmarks this lets your client know when they can expect certain work to be finished for example if you are ghostwriting a book of 100 000 words you can state that the first 30 000 words will be delivered after one month the next 30 000 after the second month and the remainder after three months remember to clarify how the client is supposed to approve of the work or suggest changes for example you might give the client a week to review your work and then submit changes in writing explain how to cancel the contract either you or your client might want to end the relationship early you should explain how the contract can be terminated and the grounds for doing so specify how the client is responsible for making payments after they cancel for example you can write client may cancel at any time for any reason cancellation must be in writing client is responsible for payment for all work performed on the project up to the date cancellation is received if client cancels the project after its completion client must make full payment add a confidentiality clause your client might not want you talking to anyone about the work that you do for example you might be working with confidential information that is valuable the confidentiality clause should identify the confidential information and explain how long the confidentiality must be kept 10 x research source for example you can write contractor acknowledges she may receive information relating to client s products creative works business strategies vendor lists and other proprietary information which gives client an advantage contractor agrees to protect the confidentiality of this confidential information for three years contractor agrees not to share this confidential information with third parties or to use the confidential information for her own benefit include boilerplate provisions look at your sample contract it probably has standard provisions called boilerplate that appear in all contracts insert them in your own contract choice of law if you go to court the judge will need to apply some state s law you can choose 11 x research source dispute resolution you might want to avoid going to court if so you can choose mediation or arbitration merger state that the contract contains the entirety of your agreement this keeps the client from claiming you had an oral side agreement severability if a judge finds one portion of the contract illegal they could strike down the entire contract you can prevent that with a severability clause sign and date the contract the contract is only valid if everyone signs and dates it keep the original for your records and give the client a copy track your hours accurately you can t get paid unless you can bill accurately accordingly you need to keep detailed records about the work you do for example you can create a spreadsheet and note all of the time you spend on a project 12 x research source bill upfront the easiest way to ensure payment is to require clients to pay upfront 13 x research source for example you might be hired to create an ebook cover for a writer you can demand that the client pay a certain percentage upfront before you begin working it s up to you to set how much the client must pay some freelancers require that 100 be paid upfront however others charge 30 even if you feel uncomfortable asking for money upfront you still need to do it with new clients 14 x research source once you establish a business relationship with someone you can reduce or eliminate the down payment invoice properly you need to develop a system that allows you to invoice promptly for example it s better to invoice directly after you finish a job than to invoice only at the end of the month 15 x research source as a compromise you might want to bill once a week your invoice should contain all important information your name and contact information the project name reference number and payment amounts invest in invoicing software so that your billing is automated which can speed up the invoicing process popular invoicing software includes freshbooks and quickbooks online 16 x research source if costs are a concern you can use microsoft office which has an invoice template offer a discount for early payment create incentives for a client to pay early for example you can offer a discount of 5 10 17 x research source this might induce prompt payment accept multiple payment options the more options you give clients to pay the more likely they will for example you should certainly look into accepting credit card payments if a client is short on funds they can use their credit card paypal offers merchant accounts that make accepting credit cards easy 18 x research source you can insert the paypal shopping cart on your website remind clients when they are late sometimes invoices get lost in the mail so a client who doesn t immediately pay isn t necessarily trying to stiff you however you need to gently remind them that payment is due by sending a follow up letter if they don t respond to your follow up you can send another letter explaining they are late and that you might need to take legal action you should also stop working for these clients until they pay you 19 x research source hire a debt collector you don t have all day to chase clients for payments eventually you might need to hire a debt collection agency who can hound the client for payment make sure the bill is sufficiently large debt collectors typically charge a percentage of the debt and they might not work for small unpaid sums slide you can find a debt collector by checking the member listings for the commercial collection agency association look for collection agencies certified by the better business bureau 20 x research source,Work-World

hours of work is considered fair 7 x research source if you are working through lunchtime consider buying your lunch from their menu tip the baristas well this will also likely keep you from suffering

least one occasion a week that is marked for working outside the home so that you can have the chance to mingle with people and soak up the energy from being near others creating a regular schedule will depend on your ease of getting to the shop as well as what days and hours the shop is open don t forget to factor in travel time for a suburban worker it s going to take more effort than for

how to manage remote employees,hiring remote employees is a great way to tap into talent from around the world figuring out how to effectively manage remote employees can seem overwhelming at first but there are a few tricks and tools you can use to keep your telecommuters productive and happy,establish your expectations for your remote employees up front if your employees don t understand what you want or need from them they won t be able to succeed detail all of your expectations in online documents videos or slideshows and pass them along to your employees make sure they include all the key information your employees need to be successful at their jobs 1 x research source for example you could create an introductory document to give to your remote employees when you hire them that outlines their responsibilities and gives them specific instructions for their job you could even include links to other documents or videos that address specific scenarios your employees might encounter so they know what you expect them to do in those situations use deadlines to help your remote employees meet your expectations without deadlines your remote employees won t know how much time they should be spending on their work or when they should be turning it in deadlines will help your employees manage their time efficiently and they ll give you a good sense of how much work is being done by your employees 2 x research source deadlines are also a good way to track how productive your remote employees are being if an employee keeps missing deadlines you ll know you need to reach out to them and go over your expectations again you can always adjust your deadlines later on if they don t work out if you realize a deadline you set isn t realistic you can extend it by a few days give your employees a quota if deadlines don t apply to the work they do sometimes remote employees are hired to do lots of short consecutive tasks where deadlines wouldn t make sense if that s the case for your employees try coming up with a quota they have to meet instead to help them manage their time and be productive for example if you hire remote employees to respond to customer inquiries for your company you could let your employees know you expect them to answer 3 4 inquiries per hour if you need help coming up with a quota try doing the job your remote employees do for a day or two to see what can realistically be accomplished by one person let your employees know if they re not meeting your expectations if you notice one of your employees isn t meeting their deadlines or quotas reach out to them mention your concerns and ask if they have questions or need help with something if the problem is recurring consider whether the employee is a good fit for your business 3 x research source for example you could email your employee and say hey jon i noticed you didn t meet your deadlines the past 2 weeks it s really important that you get your work in on time is there anything i can do to help communicate with your remote employees in a clear and concise way one of the challenges of working with remote employees is that it s harder to clarify any misunderstandings since you re not down the hall to answer their questions in person it s important that you re as clear as possible up front when you communicate with them if you re giving your employees instructions or sending out a group email write it out first and read it to make sure it s clear avoid using complicated vague language as much as possible 4 x research source have someone else at the office read your memo before you send it out to see if it s easy to understand schedule routine one on one video conferences communicating over video with each employee gives you the opportunity to explain company updates and expectations more in depth and it s a great way to connect face to face with your remote employees there are lots of different video chat platforms you can choose from like skype and google hangouts try to get in at least 1 video conference monthly and individually with each employee 5 x research source communicate as a group using chat platforms sending messages over a chat platform is easier than using group email whenever you have a message to share with a group of your employees you can quickly add all the recipients in the platform to a message and send it chat platforms are also a great way for your remote employees to communicate with each other and quickly ask questions without having to send an email 6 x research source take time differences into consideration when communicating since you re working with remote employees there s a good chance that not everyone will be working in the same time zone if possible try to schedule

how to save for retirement as a digital nomad,digital nomads are freelancers independent contractors and consultants who satisfy their wanderlust by traveling the world while working online some also get temporary day jobs in countries where they can legally work this carefree lifestyle typically doesn t come with a lot of stability but it still is possible to save for retirement as a digital nomad you must budget carefully and consolidate your finances while making accommodations for a variable income 1 x research source,track your expenses carefully when you re traveling to exotic locales it can be tempting to spend extravagantly so you get the most out of the experience however if you intend to also save for retirement you must have a good idea of how much you need to spend to survive 2 x research source start by writing down your regular expenses those that won t change regardless of your location for example if you have a mobile phone bill that is always 100 a month budget that expense and any other similar expenses first once you have the expenses that don t change down take a look at what you ve spent on food lodging and transportation in the past two or three months if you haven t left home yet you ll need to come up with a reasonable estimate for these expenses consult other digital nomads to get a good idea of how much these things will cost you in the places you want to go average everything out to come up with a good daily spending figure that you can use for budgeting purposes pay down your debts before traveling it s not the best idea to start a digital nomad lifestyle when you still have significant debts such as a student loan that require monthly payments ideally you should have as few debts as possible before you set out 3 x research source if it s not going to be possible for you to eliminate your debts at least try to pay off your consumer credit such as credit cards before you go leave one credit card open to use on the road and plan on paying it off every month find ways to cut costs it can be tempting to live more extravagantly when you re on the road especially if you ve just come off of a grueling journey you ll get more bang for your buck if you stay in hostels and cheaper accommodations rather than hotels 4 x research source use your accommodations solely as a place to sleep and look for free public wi fi where you can do your work if you need a more secure internet connection for your work get an unlimited data plan and tether your mobile phone rather than eating at restaurants look for open markets and street food vendors where you can eat more cheaply you also might consider buying groceries and cooking your meals if you are staying in a place with a communal kitchen account for currency exchanges if you re getting paid in local currency make sure you know how that amount will be converted to the home currency you re using for your savings and other financial accounts 5 x research source digital nomads often are drawn to locations such as southeast asia and latin america that have a relatively low cost of living however this low cost of living also frequently translates into lower pay keep in mind that just because you can live comfortably off of the local pay in one of these areas that may not necessarily translate into significant savings if the local currency has significantly less value than your home currency maintain sufficient insurance particularly if you re young when you start the digital nomad lifestyle you may not think insurance is necessary however difficulties and accidents can happen insurance makes these issues less of a catastrophe when they occur 6 x research source look into health insurance life insurance and liability insurance as well as insurance for your personal property you also may need non owner automobile insurance depending on where you re planning to travel and whether you anticipate leasing a car at any point keep in mind that in less developed countries medical treatment may not be available at the same level of quality that you ve come to expect especially if you are from north america or europe decide where you want to retire you know you re not going to be a digital nomad forever before you start saving for retirement you need to have a good idea what country you will live in when you do retire so you can maintain your savings in that currency 7 x research source if possible you also want to set up your savings and investment accounts in that country so they ll be easier to access once you do retire most digital nomads plan on retiring in their home country don t choose another country unless you are certain you ll be able to immigrate there when you re ready to retire and settle down set aside three months expenses you want to have an emergency fund separate from your retirement savings look at your budget and determine how much your expenses will be on average for at least three months 8 x research source this money will protect you and enable you to survive as a digital nomad if for example you lose a contract or have a hard time finding work in one location you also may want to include sufficient money for a plane ticket so if you get into a difficult situation somewhere you can quickly bail out and return to your home country or somewhere else where you feel safe keep this money in a basic savings account so it will earn interest but you can access it quickly if you need to do so work with a financial planner while life as a digital nomad may seem carefree and simple your finances typically will be anything but simple look for a licensed or certified financial planner who has experience working with digital nomads 9 x research source you don t necessarily have to keep a financial planner on retainer long term but it s a good idea to at least consult someone when you re setting up your savings and investment accounts ask the financial planner about sound investment strategies and put the framework for your savings and investments in place you also want to ask about tax strategies consolidate your accounts having too many financial accounts can be difficult to keep up with when you re traveling especially if you have accounts scattered across several different countries while this sometimes can be unavoidable for digital nomads you want to try to have as few accounts as possible 10 x research source for example if you settle in one country for a longer period of time and take a day job you may need to open a local bank account when you move on somewhere else close that account try to have a specific purpose for each account you have for example you might have a retirement savings account a checking account for daily expenses and a basic savings account for your emergency fund avoid unnecessary fines and fees when you re traveling it can be relatively easy to rack up significant fines and fees as well as facing significant tax consequences if you re not careful work with a professional financial advisor to build a sound strategy 11 x research source you typically will need at least one credit card but try to pick one that has the best rewards for you as you re traveling as well as the strongest purchase protection choose a card that doesn t have an annual fee if you have any credit cards that do have annual fees you may want to close those accounts before you start traveling to avoid those fees check with your bank or financial advisor to choose the retirement fund or investment vehicle that has the most favorable tax status in the country where you plan to retire you also may want to review tax penalties for early withdrawals in the event of a significant emergency situation carefully review the tax laws in your home country regarding money earned in other countries or speak to a tax expert make sure you re not going to end up paying any fines or penalties for not filing taxes appropriately create a percentage plan the easiest way to save for retirement as a digital nomad is to look at your budget and allot a certain percentage say between 5 and 10 percent that you will put towards your retirement savings every month 12 x research source the benefit of using a percentage rather than a fixed amount is that you can easily fit it into your budget regardless of your income this works especially well if your income varies widely from place to place or if you plan on traveling extensively to choose the correct percentage think about your ultimate goal of how much you want to save then divide it by the number of years you plan to save depending on your current age and the age at which you d like to retire keep all your finances in one country you may need to set up temporary local accounts from time to time especially if you get a day job somewhere however all of your savings and your main checking account should be located in the same country 13 x research source keeping your accounts in one country also means your money is not as vulnerable to exchange rates because you re only transferring foreign currency once and it is kept in your home currency if possible try to set up all your accounts in the same bank that way you can easily transfer funds from one account to another without incurring unnecessary fees this also makes multiple accounts easier to manage many banks also offer various discounts or incentives such as a better interest rate if you have multiple accounts with them set up automatic transfers to savings based on the percentage of your income that you ve chosen to save for retirement automatic transfers either weekly or monthly from your checking or other payment account to your savings account mean you don t have to think about your savings 14 x research source if all of your accounts are being managed through the same financial advisor or using the same bank you also may be able to set up automatic transfers directly into an investment account or other retirement savings vehicle automating at least some if not all of the saving process will greatly increase your chances of success open a slush fund account when your income is widely variable you may benefit from a third savings account that allows you to skim off the excess when you have a high income month so you can get through particularly lean months 15 x research source for example if you normally make around 3 000 a month but one month you make 5 000 you could take the extra 2 000 and move it to a savings account where it will earn at least a little interest taking it out of your checking account helps you control your expenses and keeps you from splurging on unnecessary luxuries that way you ll have that money if you had an extraordinarily lean month such as if you only made 500 one month you may want to simply add this money to your emergency fund or you may want to create a separate account that you can dip into so you don t risk disturbing your emergency money review your plan at least once a year if you re saving for retirement based on a percentage plan you need to make sure your contributions especially automatic transfers are consistently in line with that percentage as your income and expenses change 16 x research source take the opportunity to review your budget and make any adjustments to your average expenses as necessary keep in mind that even though you re saving for retirement based on a percentage system your weekly or monthly automatic contributions will typically be a fixed dollar amount you may have to adjust that amount based on your actual income for example suppose that based on savings of 10 percent each month you were contributing 200 of your average income of 2 000 a month however when you review your income you find that in the entire last year you have never made less than 3 000 a month you should up your contributions to 300 a month,Work-World

how to sell photos online,years ago the only way to make money selling your pictures was with your own photography studio nowadays anybody amateur or professional can find a buyer for their photos online by using stock image sites learning how to develop your products promote your photos and choose a buyer will help you get started making money fast,look at several different sites pay rates basic stock photo sites like dreamstime freedigitalphotos net and shutterstock are popular choices for amateur photographers while the pros often choose getty images or corbis each of these sites has a different pay rate but most sites offer at least 30 commission be sure to check each site s commission rate before you sign up 1 x research source often the most popular sites pay the smallest commission whether or not you want to sell quickly for less money or wait longer for more money is up to you don t undervalue yourself if you love what you do and you re good at it charge accordingly 2 x expert source victoria sprung professional photographer expert interview 7 april 2020 check the site s requirements and themes to avoid rejected images every site has its own requirements for download quality and its own focus on themes your images won t be accepted if you don t follow the site s specific requirements make sure your photos meet the requirements and fit the site s theme before you submit them 3 x research source for example dreamstime requires a minimum of 3 megapixels for download size and they also prefer business oriented photos register for an account registration with the site that you choose is usually free if the site isn t free you may want to reconsider using them unless the fee is pretty cheap and a one time payment be sure to read the site s instructions carefully because there s often important information about payment and copyright issues included 4 x research source review and complete the payment portion of your account most sites will pay you via paypal although a few sites may pay via check through the mail you will need to provide the email address associated with your paypal account along with any additional information they require if you don t have a paypal account set one up when you re paid varies from site to site some only pay you when you request a cash out and others pay on a specific day of the month 5 x research source make sure you are registering with a reputable site before giving them your account information or home address consider registering for multiple sites registering for multiple sites can let you make more money but be careful if you sell an image on one site you may have to remove it on all your other sites also some sites will offer exclusive contracts that pay you more if you only sell your photos to them read all the fine print before registering to multiple sites 6 x research source develop a diverse portfolio of digital images if you only have 4 or 5 main subjects in your images they will only appeal to a certain kind of customer while you can still make money this way it s better to have a diverse collection of images with many different subjects and tones the more people your images appeal to the more money you ll make 7 x research source don t be afraid to experiment that s how you ll discover the style that really fits you best 8 x expert source victoria sprung professional photographer expert interview 7 april 2020 choose generic images to make the most money generic images appeal to the largest audience so these photos will sell more often than niche or unusual images go through your digital portfolio and pick out generic images with mass appeal for example images of flowers and landscapes work well 9 x research source single subject shots like a bookcase of old books a windmill or a wine bottle also work well anything business or office oriented usually does well generic tones also sell well on stock sites for example images that look vintage select images that are high quality for the best results most stock sites have rules about resolution size file format and so on make sure your images adhere to those rules so they won t be rejected if the site you re using doesn t have set requirements customers are much more likely to purchase high quality images with good resolution use only your very best work choose images with crisp detail and balanced color for example images that are blurry or high contrast wouldn t be appropriate choices upload your photos to the stock site make sure your chosen images follow all of the site s rules and requirements such as image size resolution file type and so on if your site lets you post images in specific categories make sure your photos match the categories to increase sales 10 x research source tag your images with relevant tags to appear in site searches when you upload your photos to websites they ll be among thousands of other pictures thinking of tags for each picture will help them come up first in searches pick multiple tags for each picture 11 x research source for example if you upload a picture of the beach your tags might include words like beach fun sunny day sand surfing or tropical experiment with using a mix of generic tags and specific tags generic tags are the most popular ones because they re the most searched for using generic tags will get your photos in front of the most people specific tags can get your images in front of a different group of people use a mix of both so people searching for something specific can find you and so can people searching for general terms for example if your beach picture is of a boardwalk in new jersey use generic tags like beach boardwalk ocean view and so on then include specific tags like new jersey asbury park and south point boardwalk avoid using images with visible or recognizable brands in them using images like these can get you into trouble because you ll be making money off of someone else s brand without their knowledge or approval most stock photo sites have rules against using images like this avoid them altogether to avoid running into problems 12 x research source for example an image of a ford mustang convertible or campbell s soup can would be inappropriate to upload and sell avoid using images featuring corporate logos stills from movies or anything else originally made by something else avoid using images with people or properties in them any person that appears in your stock photos must sign a release form before the image can be sold the same goes for images depicting someone s personal property such as a local storefront or your neighbor s barn you would need to track down the correct legal forms and get them signed each time you used an image like this which would be a hassle in some cases it may even be impossible 13 x research source you can download model release forms online or write up your own take all your photos yourself to get an automatic copyright according to international copyright law the photographer automatically owns the copyrights to anything they take themselves you don t have to register or sign up for the copyright if you were the one operating the camera 14 x research source one exception is photos taken while you were employed by a company as a photographer for example if you are a photographer working for a newspaper the newspaper owns the photos you take on the job registering your copyright isn t required but it s often a good idea it can prevent people from stealing your work,Work-World

rewarding,research and read articles from other travel writers the first step in becoming a travel writer is to read as much as possible reading other travel blogs will help you get a grasp on what travel writing should look like it will also help you figure out what kind of travel writing you want to do try regularly reading one or two famous travel writing blogs for a month or so pay close attention to how they re writing their stories what do they focus on what s their tone how do people respond to their articles every travel writer is different but you ll find they all aim to be informative personable and accessible to readers they convey their personality and their likes and dislikes in what they choose to write about if you aren t sure what sites to visit some popular travel blogs like nomadic matt view from the wing expert vagabond or the planet d are some great places to start 1 x research source don t be afraid to take notes the more information you have the better prepared you will be when you start writing yourself figure out your niche or angle since there is currently a plethora of travel writers both online and in print it s good to have your own point of view this can be anything from writing specifically about food when traveling to writing about a specific activity like deep sea diving or simply going different places for different cultural events like festivals having a niche will also help you be specific and clear in the point you are trying to convey to your reader do you want to give them tips immerse them in the sights and sounds of a particular city describe a food so well they can taste it start a website once you have an idea for what you want to write on and how it s best to build a site as an online base you should keep all of your writings photographs and links to social media on your blog you should also have a mini bio about yourself a small itinerary about past and future travels and maybe a picture of you this site will act as a portfolio for you when you want to get published so the more content you have on it the better there are a multitude of online sites you can use for blogging if you re just starting out try a free website like weekly wix wordpress or blogger if you have a bit more experience and want more options try a paying website like squarespace travel everywhere being a travel writer doesn t just mean going abroad to exotic or foreign places it s unlikely you will have either the time or money to constantly be on the move instead you need to learn to write about all places write on areas you ve previously traveled to or even areas within your local community not everyone has lived where you have and it s your job to make these places accessible to them through your writing try going to local festivals locally owned restaurants parks bookstores anywhere that seems interesting to you look for stories knowing what to write on isn t always going to be obvious especially if you re just writing about your hometown you need to try and see things from a different perspective picture yourself as someone who has never visited and imagine what questions they might have what would they be interested in or want to see chances are there s a lot going on in your local area that even you aren t aware of find it 2 x research source try going to local festivals concerts plays restaurants or parks learning to describe even the ordinary in a way that someone will want to read is a great way to get comfortable in travel writing and find your voice you can join mailing lists for events in many cities you can also join local forums or get local newsletters that will let you know what s going on around you speak to locals whether you re writing on an area you know well or somewhere completely new speaking to other people is a great way to find new stories it can be hard to find things outside of your interests so speaking to different people within the area can help open up new doors for you they can tell you about events introduce you to new people or even take you places on their own you could ask what s the best food around town or is there a local myth or legend document your experience think about what moves you and why when you go to a new place take note of how you feel and react to things did you go somewhere and hate everything what particular events set you off and why sometimes it s difficult to figure out what about an event or place is affecting you so writing down in the moment and reviewing later will help you keep track of these things for example if you taste a new food and have a negative reaction write down what it was and why if you re watching a festival and a moment stands out to you write it down 3 x research source you can write these things down anywhere keep a little notebook a diary or even type notes into your phone you aren t likely to remember everything perfect after a day or trip has ended so taking frequent notes will help you out be honest the best travel writing is usually down to earth people want to feel what it s like to live in a place as a local they don t want the tourist experience or for you to be giving them a sales pitch about why a place is wonderful you want to be objective but you also want to be true to your experience writing is a personal experience and travel writing should be no different 4 x research source be careful not to be cliche though there are plenty of articles on hidden gems or secret spots in cities these read like advertisements don t write a log of your daily life no one wants to read an in depth account of how you spent every minute of your day you need to focus on small moments and be descriptive use anecdotes tell stories make it personal for example if you are visiting a small bakery in monterosso italy and have a moment of nostalgia because it smells like your grandmother s kitchen tell the reader this publish local or small if you have a local community paper of magazine in your area try getting some of your writings published there first or if there s a particular website you really like try to see if you can submit an article you want to focus small at first and try to develop a relationship with an editor to regularly get your work out there this will help you build up your travel writing resume and portfolio to get more opportunities later 5 x research source you can usually find submission information directly in the paper magazine or on their website if you can t find it try emailing the editor you can write something like ms scott my name is ron conway i am currently working as a travel writer and was looking for some information about possibly submitting an article make connections via social media as difficult or awkward as it can be you need to build an online presence make sure you tweet and regularly update your social media like instagram facebook or snapchat even if you feel no one s paying attention it s best to stay consistent the more things you use the more people you can access and in turn get to come to your blog also try tweeting at people who are travel writers or have blogs related to travel writing don t self promote but contribute to conversations make yourself known for being knowledgeable these people may then come to your blog and later promote you which will get you more traffic make connections in the industry a big part of making connections is talking to everyone you can you never know when a random encounter could connect you to something or someone great making friends with people in the travel industry hotel workers concert bookers or other workers in the areas you re interested in will help you get to new places these people will help you get inside

how to write for major magazines,breaking into the magazine market as a freelancer can be tough at first especially if you re shooting for a national magazine however many magazines rely on freelance writers for content the best way to break into the market is to start small and work your way up once you ve done that you can make a pitch to a major magazine and keep your fingers crossed that the editor likes your work,pick an idea the pitch is an introduction to the story you d like to do for a magazine it gives the editor a general idea about the story itself as well as your own writing abilities when choosing an idea for your pitch think about subjects that matter to you you don t need to interview the next president but you do need it to be something compelling that other people will relate to if you re interested in human interest stories look to your local paper maybe you can find a short piece on a person that you can interview and turn into a longer piece think local and global at the same time that is what s happening locally that reflects something that a large number of other people will be interested in research your idea you want to be at least something of an expert on your topic before you write it plus you want to make sure your idea will make a good article before you pitch it you don t want to be approved for an idea that you find out later you can t write therefore it s important to research your topic thoroughly so you know what you re getting yourself into research the magazine make sure your idea is the perfect fit for the magazine you choose for submission also ensure that you read a few previous issues to understand exactly what kind of content they publish if you don t want to spend too much money buying back issues search for old copies of the magazine in the library or purchase cheap copies at a used book store remember that your first job is to impress the editor if possible research the editor and what kind of articles they have accepted in the past this will give you an idea of what they look for in a story and allow you to tailor your pitch article to their preferred style check the submission guidelines most magazines have their submission guidelines posted on their website look for length restrictions as well as style guidelines magazines will either want you to follow an established style guideline like ap or use one they have created style guidelines will tell you things like how to write numbers when to use a serial comma and how to capitalize titles these may sound like minor details but getting them right can make a positive impression on the editor as it shows them that you ve done your homework the submission guidelines should also tell you what kind of content the magazine is looking to use keep the pitch short it s important to keep your pitch short usually less than a page just like a cover letter at most it should be a page and a half if the pitch is too long the editor will be more likely to just skim over it and potentially miss the main point of the article keeping it short allows them to easily grasp what you want the article to say and make a quick yes or no decision also be sure to keep it free of typos and grammatical errors like a cover letter the pitch is where you show the editor you can write introduce your idea in the first paragraph explain your idea in a short compelling manner in the next 2 3 paragraphs tell the editor why your story is important keep it to one idea per paragraph next outline how you want to execute your story that is when and where are you going to find your information who are you going to talk to how are you going to incorporate that information into your story don t forget to include previous publications as that shows you have writing skills you can list a few in paragraph form or a short bulleted list wrap it up in the conclusion make sure your editor knows exactly why this story should be in his or her magazine remember that even if you find a good story your first task is convincing the magazine editor that it s the right story for them understand how magazine writing differs from other types of writing writing for a magazine is a bit different than other types of writing it is informative but it s also entertainment you want to open the readers eyes to something they ve never noticed before an essay you re writing for class is not likely something that your professor has never read in the past unless you are in a postgraduate program also in an essay you re building an argument while a magazine article is more story based though there is still an underlying point also the writing style for most magazine articles tends to be more short and to the point as well as being more fact based unless you are writing an editorial rather than opinion based writing an article is also different from many freelance writing jobs as many of those are marketing based where the company employing you is trying to drive traffic to the site while magazines also have this goal in mind they tend to do it through using trending topics and entertaining readers rather than trying to trick search engines to drive their results higher do your research again research research research the best sources are often people so set up interviews make sure to record your interviews and take notes so that you have a backup system also always be professional when conducting interviews show up on time dress nicely and be polite however you can also use other resources of course check local papers archives and books at the local library anything that will help you tell the story just remember that more current resources are generally considered better especially in journalism organize your research outline exactly where you want your story to go remember that in a journal article you want to tell the story little by little not all at once keep that in mind when making your outline begin writing begin with a great hook a hook draws your reader in it can be a short anecdote a joke or a shocking fact make sure whatever you choose is appropriate for the venue the hook should be relevant drawing your reader in to the story continue with a strong over arching narrative in some ways a magazine article isn t that different from a short story you are leading up to a climax for the reader and you want to spin your story well i n that vein make sure you keep the suspense going that is continue to drop in new details throughout the article and make sure the story flows in a logical manner include personable details details that your readers can connect to for instance instead of saying june was a middle aged housewife you could say june spends her days at home caring for her two kids she gave up a career in accounting to take care of her family the second set of sentences provides more detail allowing more space for the reader to connect with it use short sentences and make it concise like all journalism space in magazines is at a premium you will have a set word limit stick with it also short sentences make more sense in a format like a magazine where small columns make long sentences look longer and more confusing wrap it up you don t want to draw too much on cliché but most magazines will want you to wrap up the story nicely have a climax a high point and pull it altogether into the point your making review your article after you have finished writing have someone proofread both your pitch and article for grammatical errors there is a good chance they will pick up on errors that you missed also remember to go back and make sure that your story will fit into the submission guidelines always meet your deadline not only is the deadline basically a contract with the magazine but also you will build a good reputation by always being on time if you miss your deadline the magazine and editor will be less inclined to want to work with you again in the future if you re rejected don t give up many writers are rejected a number of times before they are accepted somewhere try your story at other places until one of them accepts it even if you can t find a home for your current article try another one eventually you ll find one that an editor loves,Work-World
