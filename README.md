# Data Mining 2020 - Classification of WikiHow pages

Parser made as prelimary work for the final project for Data Mining class at the University of Pisa, carried out by Marsha Gomez Gomez and Daria Maggi.

The aim is to build a multi-class classifier of Wikihow pages. A Wikihow page pertains to one and only one of 19 macro-categories. Right now resources are labeled by hand by the creator of the resource, but our aim is to build an automatic tool for the task, based on the article's text and summary. 

The report can be found [here](https://github.com/dariamaggi/parser/tree/master/Project%20Documentation).
