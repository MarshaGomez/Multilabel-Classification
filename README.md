# Data Mining 2020 - Classification of WikiHow pages

The aim is to build a multi-class classifier of Wikihow pages. A Wikihow page pertains to one and only one of 19 macro-categories. Right now resources are labeled by hand by the creator of the resource, but our aim is to build an automatic tool for the task, based on the article's text and summary. 

The report can be found [here](https://github.com/dariamaggi/parser/tree/master/Project%20Documentation/Data_Mining_report.pdf).
